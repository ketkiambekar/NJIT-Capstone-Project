Doubtful she'll last the night. After years of fighting she's finally run out of energy. Nothing can be done. Cancer came back and ...

It's lonely sitting here with her, waiting for the end. You can hear the world moving around outside this room and for the moment I don't feel part of it. I feel disconnected. I don't want to say goodbye but there is no choice. I feel selfish because I don't want to let go.  This is so overwhelming.

Update 
We're settled in a private room on the 10th floor. Mom is off all the monitors and is on a constant drip for pain. Very calm and quiet here. Mom is still coherent but fading. Hoping it isn't long.¬†

I've been reading the wonderful support comments. I just don't have the mental energy to respond. Sorry.

UPDATE: Sorry for the lack of update. Mom lasted a week and died on Easter Sunday. I was able to be there the entire time, unlike many who can't say goodbye. She passed peacefully and in no pain thanks to the care given. I'm not sure how I'm moving through life at the moment. I'm .. gutted. She always had faith in me and my biggest booster. Now, I'm alone. Lock down means I can't go to friends and talk. I'm here, rattling around the apartment trying to say goodbye to her.  Thank you for the support.

My mother was a good woman taken from this world far too soon by cancer. So was my grandmother. And my lovely father-in-law left us way too early, from the same cancer that took my mom and grandmother.

My Dad died tonight,41,jcnog2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/jcnog2/my_dad_died_tonight/,10,1602932247.0,"I‚Äôve posted on here a few times to vent, so I suppose this will be the last time. (Well I‚Äôll still comment on other people‚Äôs posts, offering what support I can, but there won‚Äôt be a need to create a new post now)

He‚Äôd been declining the last 2 weeks. I flew over from FL to visit him (3 times in 2 months actually), but this time, he really declined from how he was when I first came to how he was today. 

He‚Äôd been in such pain that my sister had to call Hospice to make him more comfortable, and he still resisted pain meds for as long as possible. He only recently started allowing us to give them to him, and honestly it was probably bc he was in too much pain to respond most of the time. (There were some humorous moments when he got annoyed enough to respond - like when the one nurse asked him his preference on something and he replied in a whisper ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a sh*t‚Äù, or when my sister and I were trying to ask him if he wanted to be elevated and eventually she was like ‚ÄúI think he wants to‚Äù and he freaking started doing a sarcastic clap. I hated seeing him at his end, but at least there were these moments to make me smile now, even if they hurt) 

This last day, the pain increased exponentially, it seemed like the morphine wasn‚Äôt working, and his rasping from the congestion just got worse and worse. 

We had a music therapist person associated with the hospice over, and as she was leaving and talking to my sister, I went back in the room and he started gasping for breath. I ran over to him and was trying to encourage him to breath, it‚Äôs a little fuzzy tbh but I remember crying and begging him to just please keep breathing, trying to take deep breaths for him to follow. I don‚Äôt remember if I got the breathing tube before or after and held it to his face, but at some point he just stopped breathing. 

I texted my sister when it started to happen, and when she hadn‚Äôt come I yelled for one of her kids to go and get her, and honestly I‚Äôm pretty sure I called her after he stopped breathing but I‚Äôm honestly it sure. 

She might have come in at the tail end of it. But yeah, de died right in front of me. 

U know, all I wanted from going to see him, was for him to see that I loved him, even if I don‚Äôt verbally express it that much (he once told me that I‚Äôm basically him in how I act; very similar, so I always hoped he knew that was why I wasn‚Äôt as verbal as my sister). 

It‚Äôs a weird way to cope, but even though I was a wreck as it was happening, I hope he saw how much I loved him in those last moments. That‚Äôs all I wanted really. Well aside from begging God to at least let my father rest, if not get into heaven. 

I‚Äôm not gonna get into the religious contexts of what I believe, but I can only hope that his soul rests until it is time to rise, and that he‚Äôll be able to go home. I hope I can see him again one day. 

I‚Äôm crying now. 

I‚Äôm gonna be a wreck. 

Honestly it‚Äôs ironic too. I was supposed to go back home today, my plane was for 8am, but I canceled last minute... the day I was supposed to leave was the day he left. I don‚Äôt really know what that means. But I‚Äôm glad I canceled and was there for him until the end. 

Thanks for letting me vent.

Not a day goes by I dont think about you. I remember when you first came into my life like it was yesterday. 
Do you remember the details? I do. How I thought the strange lump was simply caused by a more curable illness. How calm I was going to my ENT doctor and being told perhaps I should visit my endocrinologist. 
How I still hoped for the best despite being told the swelling in my neck wasnt from strep throat and my FNA was inconclusive on both tests. Despite being scheduled for a surgery to remove half of the organ the lump resided on. 
I was 19. My whole life ahead of me. I remember waking up, groggy and disoriented. I had to pee SO badly. I remember a nurse shoving a bedpan under me when I could hardly move and peeing on the bed I was in because what 19 yr old knows how to use a bedpan? I missed my family. What time was it? My throat was so raw from the breathing tube. It's so bright and everything hurts. Voices and lights acknowledged but I cant register their meaning. Finally, I see familiar faces. So worried, so loving. Please dont be upset, I'm still here. Ice chips are so soothing, but I cant talk yet. Fire on my throat, I want to ask my family everything I dont know but i can barely whisper. Morphine, sweet numbing darkness, and I can sleep. 
I rest. I go home a few days later. I remember sitting with my family, loving the moment. My phone rings. ""Yes, Doctor? A second surgery?... I see.. its positive?"" Smiles falling as if cut from a string. ""Please dont worry, it will be okay Mom!"" I say. Repeat surgery, not so bad as the first. Private room this time. But I cant sleep. Needles prod me every hour. Bruises along both arms. My body no longer produces calcium, my mouth is tingling and eyes burn thinking ""Why me?"" 4 days later, I am discharged, never knowing what ""normal"" means again.
Welcome to a lifetime of medicine. Welcome to a lifetime of never having your body be truly ""yours"". Cancer, you are not a friend, but our lives are entwined deeper than the most passionate lovers. You do not define me... but your existence and influence in my life cannot be ignored. Perhaps, one day, we will make peace. Perhaps we may not. I can accept your presence.

But your presence does not define me.
I am still me, despite you. And I always will be. 
Thank you, for showing me who I truly am. I am resilient. And strong. And beautiful. Courageous. Loving. Understanding. Patient. You will never take that away from me. No matter what.

Love, me.",2020-10-12 15:15:01

I carry guilt. For not visiting he enough at the hospital.

My dad passed away last Thursday, the 20th of August. He was diagnosed with colon cancer on the 22nd of July. Not even a month. It all happened so fast. And it's just fucked up.

I talked to my mom about it today... It feels more as if he's on a trip right now, rather than that he's dead. And you know, we thought he would make it. We were hopeful.

I don‚Äòt really know what I expect from this post. Three hours ago I got the call from the hospital that my mom peacefully died. She had an agressive breast cancer that came back this summer just after her first treatment. She struggled with pneumonia in December, was in a coma in January due to ARDS and fought so well. I really thought that she would make it after mastering all of this.

I feel so empty, I never expected to lose my mom at this age. I‚Äòm an only child and my father is falling apart since the diagnosis, especially in the last few weeks where she was at the palliative ward. I feel like changing roles by being the strong part that my father is expected to be.

How did you overcome your feelings? I know that moving on is the best for me after the time of grief. I have lost my best friend and mom at the age of 22. Realizing that she will not get to know my boyfriend and is not able to see me graduate from university makes me more than sad.

I didn‚Äôt even have any time to prepare. It‚Äôs not fair. She was literally one of the kindest people to ever set foot on this planet. Why did I only get 21 years with my mom? She‚Äôll never see me have graduate college, get married, have kids. Did I do something wrong to have my mom taken from me this early? Why the fuck do pieces of literal human garbage get to live till they‚Äôre old and can‚Äôt walk but my mom had to be taken from me so young? What did I do to deserve this pain? Why does everybody else who gets diagnosed live for at least a few months while my mom got 2 weeks? My life was turned upside down and changed forever in an instant. It‚Äôs not fair, it hurts.

Edit: Thank you for all of your messages. Y‚Äôall are so kind. I‚Äôm definitely going to be looking into some sort of counseling. I want to respond to each of you but I don‚Äôt know what to say.

May 23, in the middle of the night, she had passed. I was with her as her life slipped away. Even in death, my dear looked so beautiful. Things feel so off without her around, nothing can replace the glowing energy my dear would radiate.

Home life is pretty lonely. I take care of her two cats, I love them dearly. But I'm not sure I'll find love the same way I had loved, and still love, my wife. I'm not sure if I even want to, I'm a pretty old guy and I still feel I'm with her even after death. But in reality, it's surreal to wake up in a bed by yourself. The bed you once shared iwith the person you love and spent every night and morning with sleeping beside.

My dearest Angela, I miss you. You were my sweetheart, you were a wonderful mother, and an amazing grandmother.

No matter how much you know its coming, hearing it just rips your heart out. Now he is on hospice care and i am learning to get through my day acting normal. Not to make this about me but i am trying to have some tact so dad can enjoy his last days with us. Planning a day to the shore because he loves the ocean. But my mind cannot get the image of the seizure from my mind. There were no convulsions. I thought it was a heart attack thats how it looked. I did chest conpressions because i couldnt detect any breathing. Each moment burns knowing the last words passed my lips could be my last to him. Its getting harder to pretend i am ok when all i want to do is cry. I know i am not alone, so many before me have been in my shoes, but it still feels like i am stranded. Then i have horrible thoughts like it would have been so much easier if it had been a heart attack. He would have died believing there was hope instead of living in dispare with an ever growing depression. He would have died clear headed instead of an expanded confusion. He would have died with strong legs instead of wobbling to just stand. I hate myself for this thought and yet as he asks me the same question for the fourth time i revisit it. I feel so selfish. I feel so heartless. But im not heartless just broken hearted. I fight to he strong for everyone around me, to be that rational voice. To be that helping hand. Yes i could see a profession, but i truely believe i know most of what they will say. I just need to deal with my emotions. And i cannot deal with them as long as my mom and dad are in my house, and yet i dred when they will go back to their house because it means the moment may come and i would have unknowingly lived that last moment.

Less than two weeks ago it took him from me. He went from being an fun, affable, softy (but tough on the outside) to a weak, angry, fragile, man at only 67. He had never looked old previously and it all happened so fast. He had to have three life saving surgeries in 3 weeks, but the cancer just continued to spread and the surgeries were too much for his now thin and frail body to handle. 

The cancer in the bone caused bone breakage and he was in unimaginable pain and suffering. He moaned from pain all the time despite max doses of pain medications. He tried to kill himself all the time by pulling out his oxygen so we constantly watched 24-7 to put him back in for him. He ripped everything (IV, electrodes) out all hours of the day and tried to get out of bed to maybe end it. He told everyone he was done and he wanted to die. This included fighting off the nurses who tired to stop him from hurting himself, and fighting my poor mother who stood by his side for 45 years and they loved each other to death. They were a real-life love story and fought only twice I can ever even remember. 

In his last week he pushed against me, his own daughter because I tried to prevent him from dying. I begged him not to but I could see the fear and pain and anger in his eyes as he ripped out the IV and the electrodes. I had to scream for the nurses because I couldn‚Äôt hold him down. 

I have to go back and thank the nurses when the Covid-19 has stopped spreading. Hospice brought him home after everything went downhill. He was finally home with my mom and his three daughters by his side instead of just with my mom in the hospital. We told him he was home and he kept saying ‚Äúoh great.‚Äù And smiling so big despite all the pain. When I saw him his eyes had yellowed and were rolling into his head from the cancer spreading to his liver, he was aspirating because he couldn‚Äôt swallow and was hallucinating and out of it and groaning constantly in pain from the cancer in the bones and all over. His appendages were blackened. He was straddling the line between being alive and dead. 

Anyway, my father was born in Italy so he switched into Italian near the end. There was a lot of nonsense he was saying due to the pain medication and all of the things happening to his body. This all happened hours before he passed.

But then he started saying ‚Äúthe light, the light, oh the light.‚Äù

My sisters and my mom and I were crying and telling him not to go please.

He then started talking to my uncle who had passed away from cancer maybe 8 years ago and saying ‚Äúhey Pete how are you doing are you good?‚Äù (All in Italian dialect.) 

We said crying ‚Äúplease leave Pete you can‚Äôt take him‚Äù ‚Äúwe love you but please go away‚Äù

I said ‚Äúhey dad it‚Äôs me look at me‚Äù

He said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see anything from up here.‚Äù 

I was able to sing to him and he patted his belly and had my moms hand and was moving it back and forth. Every time I told him ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù He responded ‚ÄúI love you too.‚Äù He literally couldn‚Äôt breathe, and he was so so out of it but he could say those words. He could enjoy my singing and the music. He always loved for me to sing for him.

He then randomly said in the middle of all his nonsense some things very clearly ‚Äúwell of course you miss them. I know you do.‚Äù

And to my mother he said ‚Äúciao, ___‚Äù 

We all finally told him (sobbing hysterically) to go play cards with the relatives in heaven and he could finally let go then. After that he let go. He waited to be home with us and then he let go. 

He died in the morning after a long night in which we had called the Chaplin and hospice nurse who told us he was taking his last breaths. He was so peaceful looking when he finally stopped breathing and the birds were signing like crazy and the sun shone beautifully. 

Also, no one is allowed to take this story and share it for any purposes. It‚Äôs only for the purpose of sharing that there is something after and I have given my life to Jesus now. Thanks for listening.",2020-04-06 08:35:39

On August 13 he was taken to the hospital by ambulance due to pain and complications. We assumed he just needed another blood transfusion but he felt a ""pop"" feeling and was doubled over in pain. Due to Covid no one could go with him to the hospital. The poor guy had to go in by ambulance all alone.. later that night he called my Mom and said he was going in for surgery because they found a patch of flesh eating disease on his side. He was informed of the risks and that he may not make it out of surgery, but he wanted to fight it. He made it out of surgery, but his vitals were low. We were informed he may not make the night, but he thankfully did. 
They found another patch on his other side, but because he was sedated my Mom had to make the executive decision whether or not he should go through another surgery. He had another surgery and made it. Again, vitals very low. Temperature was very low, and he had skin and tissue removed from both sides and his back. He was hooked up to so many IVs and medications, as well as a ventilator. 

Things started to look up. He didnt need as many antibiotics, the respirator was only doing 30% of the work, his white blood cell count was going up and he was becoming more alert. He had a tracheotomy so he couldn't talk to us, but he used a letter board to spell out sentances. This was last week. 

On Wednesday we got news his organs were failing, they found 3 new tumors in his stomach and due to his condition could not continue chemo (which we knew would happen), and he was in constant pain. He fought so hard. He never gave up. Even today during his final moments he was still fighting hard.

So about a month and a half ago now, my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 liver cancer with 4 months to 4 years left to live. Truth be told I've been crying about the diagnosis itself since I found out but I had no idea how crazy this was going to be. 
Two weeks after my moms diagnosis she started chemo and had an extremely negative reaction to it. The process of chemo hurt my moms liver more and put her into almost complete renal shut down. Consequences we finally realized after her being hospitalized for a week straight after 2 days of chemo. 

Last week my parents told me that my mom will not be undergoing dialysis to prolong her life nor will she be resuming chemo to prolong her life either. Last week she had 1-2 weeks left to live. Today I am bringing my boyfriend with me to see her for the last time. 

I'm not ready to say goodbye to my mom yet. Shes only 58 and I'm only 22. For a large portion of my life I have essentially acted as my moms guardian bc her perception of reality is so skewed. It is to the point where no one seems to understand what shes saying and brushes it off to ""shes talking in code and is crazy"" when in all actuality she just struggles with finding the word or never learned the concept. I'm one of the only people that my mom has said understands her. Shes genuinely the only member of my immediate family that I have been close to and I'm not ready to let her go yet.

It kills me to see such a genuinely kind woman be struck with this and know that I almost definitely wont see her again after today. And it kills me that she'll never see me move into my first home, graduate college, get married, or have kids. And it hurts that shes dealt with emotional (and possibly some physical) abuse for pretty much her entire life and never felt strong enough to get away and be free. 

And while I will tell you this again later mom, I love you and I hope when you pass you go without pain and that then you can finally experience and enjoy some freedom I'll miss you and this will probably be one of the hardest deaths I've dealt with in my life, but as long as you aren't suffering anymore, i will understand and will be happy for you.

I had previously lost my father when I was 11 due to an motorcycle accident and I couldn‚Äôt help comparing the two and which was worse. Is it worse not knowing when your parent is going to die, and then it just happens out of the blue, without saying goodbye? Or is it better to know when they are going to die, so you can say goodbye, but you have to watch them become someone else (especially in the case of brain cancer where it alters moods and states of being similar to Alzheimer‚Äôs). I still cannot choose, but both are shitty. 

I just want to put out there that to those who‚Äôs families have been separated, to those families who have immunocompromised loved ones who they cannot are due to the Corona Virus lockdown, I am so so sorry. And I feel your struggle. Please know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

And to those who are not in as much trouble remember, tomorrow is never promised and today is a gift. Call your loved ones, shoot them a text, send a letter, and tell them how much they mean to you.",2020-04-27 10:18:10

Pregnant wife has cervical cancer and I'm finding hard to deal with it.,22,fcd38b,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/fcd38b/pregnant_wife_has_cervical_cancer_and_im_finding/,7,1583189315.0,"I've written here before, but with cancer the situation changes a lot in so little time that today is very different from 1 month ago.   


My wife is pregnant (28 +2 weeks) with our first baby girl and was diagnosed with Stage IIB Cervical Cancer 1 month ago. She has been in this incredible pain almost for 6 months, mainly because the pregnancy increases the pain. She has taken a lot of painkillers at this point, and we have tried a lot of methods (from the ""traditional"" to the ""alternative"" ones) but we always come back to the painkillers.  


Now...the thing is that the baby is getting bigger and the pain is getting worse. But the baby cannot be born right now, we have to wait 6 more weeks. The main problem is that the painkillers that work for her are now forbidden due to complications and bad things that could happen to the baby. So she has to deal almost all by herself with the pain, that overwhelms her.   


**It's very hard.**   


Time passes so slow. I have to keep going to my 9-5 office job, cannot be with her all the time, and if I could there's little I can do for her. I'm with her, give her companionship, attend her, love her, assure her I will be there forever for her, but that's all I can do. I'm worried that the pain she's in will damage her in a psychological way, or worse, that she cannot withstand the pain and something awful happens. There are a lot of complications also with the baby, as contractions tend to happen if she's in a lot of pain.  


So...It's a very difficult situation, and I need a little support. Thank you for reading.",2020-03-02 22:48:35

Feeling helpless.,23,c34snl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/c34snl/feeling_helpless/,6,1561112134.0,"First time poster. been feeling really down.

My dad was diagnosed with esophageal cancer stage 4 august 14th 2017. Since then he has been part of 2 trials and had 3 different chemo treatments. The first trial showed alot of promise before it maxed out. One chemo was awful. One only kinda worked and now this trial. But...

This week my dad was told that not only is treatment not working but that things have gotten worse and he is too weak to start any new treatment. He doesn't eat that much and doesnt drink water and he fights with my mom whenever she tries to get him to do stuff to make him stronger. He has become so emotionally moody that he has had abusive moments going as far as to tell my mom if he dies it is because of her nagging. I tried talking to him but he doesnt see rhe problem. I even asked him if he wants to keep fighting and he says he hasnt given up yet but his actions dont agree. 

Anyway 

 I have suggested multiple times that they both talk to professionals about their emotions but neither will. I have been their emotional support for years but i have a newborn and am barely holding it together since this news, i dont think i can bare the weight of their emotions as well. Its rough and its hard to find anyone who understands without looking at you with pity. This is not my fight to fight, it is my dads, if he chooses to, but it is hard being strong in front of everyone including the baby. I thought about talking to a professional myself but cant fit it into my time between baby, work, helping parents (while not making them feel like a burden). Sorry for the vent but this is the only place i could go. I tried talking to husband but honestly, he is terrible at comforting. Terrible with words. So the best i get is a hug and a reminder not to drink too much wine. Which i can only have a glass once in a while because of breastfeeding so it feels more like salt in a wound.

Thanks for letting me vent.",2019-06-21 10:15:34

Since then, we've been dealt gut punch after gut punch. Here are some of the things we've done to make his last year+ special. Maybe someone can build off it for their own families, or provide even more ideas.

\- We had a large birthday party (of course, COVID has now made this impossible).

\- My sister and I, and our respective fiances, had a double wedding so dad could be in attendance.

\- We had dad do one of those books that allow someone to record themselves reading it for any future children to listen to.

\- For Father's Day, I had friends, family, neighbors, former classmates, bankers, former teachers, etc. share stories about dad - big and small - that he read and was able to reminisce about. We focused on positive moments in his life and I think it was helpful for him to see how many people shared so many precious moments with him.

\- I wrote him a personal letter, letting him know that while he will be so greatly missed, we will be OK.  I will take care of his wife (my stepmom) to the best of my ability and live my life in a way that would make him proud.

\- We have always been very closed, but neither of us is very into saying ""I love you,"" but we have made sure to say it much more often.

As all of you know, there aren't words that can do the situation justice. But I think doing these things will help ensure there aren't any more regrets than there have to be in the long run. Hopefully this is able to help someone.",2020-08-13 01:57:04

Stairs are an issue which means he's confined to our bedroom upstairs.  It's a nice bedroom with an ensuite, tv, and room to sit in a comfy chair.

He has asked to come downstairs and hospice have told him that he is not physically able to and if he attempts he will most likely fall and end up in hospital where he will die. My husband keeps bringing this up and I've been advised to keep distracting him.  His brother keeps on at me about different ways we could get him down the stairs despite professionals telling us it is not a good idea.

She is in a type of coma now and has been for about 5 days, just breathing very shallow and very fast, no food or liquid at all we just wet her mouth with a swab throughout the day. 

Is there anything I can do to make sure she is as comfortable as possible? She doesn‚Äôt groan or frown and there is good air circulation in the room, the doctor said was all good news but I really want to make sure she isn‚Äôt in any discomfort.

We don‚Äôt want her to be alone when the time comes for her to go, me and my sister (23) sleep in the same room with her but how will we know when the time is close? Do all patients have the death rattle at the end of life even if she is already on medication to reduce the fluid buildup in her lungs and throat? Are there any other signs in the last days/hours?

It‚Äôs a very strange and confusing experience for me and I‚Äôm not really sure if I have even come to terms with it yet, I just feel a bit lost in the whole situation which is why I have come here to see if it can help. Thank you all for your time.",2019-08-19 00:37:44
Another sad rant about my dad,20,j56i46,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/j56i46/another_sad_rant_about_my_dad/,7,1601874050.0,"I wrote on here about a month ago about my dad who passed away because of colon cancer - he was diagnosed less than a month before he died. I wrote about feeling numb and how I thought it was a defense mechanism. 

And now, I'm not numb anymore. Now I feel everything. I have so close to tears no matter what situation. It can be a street reminding me of him, or a song that he didn't even like. Or just cooking pasta. It hurts so much, and I feel like I live with this veil of sadness covering me everyday. I just want to sleep all the time, and talking to people feel like a huge mountain to climb. Like I can't connect anymore and I really don't have any interest in talking to anyone.

I just miss him so fucking much. It still feels like he's gonna live at some point again, and realizing that he won't is heartbreaking. It feels like if I just wish hard enough he will come back. Nothing about this feels real. It just feels like a fake world or something. And then all the ""if:s""... I know I can't change the past, and I know that grief is different for everyone. But it's getting harder and harder for each day... I'm scared of it going the wrong way. I'm just so tired.

Started in her breasts then spread to lymph nodes, lungs, and bones. She‚Äôs gone through so much. Multiple major surgeries, rounds of chemo, radiation, and hospital visits. On Christmas Eve she was hospitalized in the palliative unit and will be transferred to hospice in a few days. The doctor thinks she only has a few more weeks left.

It‚Äôs so hard seeing her in such immense pain. I feel like I‚Äôm watching my mom die a slow and painful death. She has bags of morphine attached to her but her pain level is still at a 7. She has on and off fevers so she‚Äôs hot, sweating, and extremely uncomfortable from the pain. I keep asking the doctor to up the morphine dosage, which he does, but she is still hurting so much. I wish there was something that could numb her body completely so she can be comfortable and enjoy her last few weeks of life. 

I feel completely broken. My mom loves life so much and is not ready to give up even though her body is shutting down. She has asked the doctor to resuscitate her if she goes into cardiac arrest. She forces herself to eat little bites of food because she knows she needs food in her system. I wish I can tell her it‚Äôs okay to let go, but she is so hopeful I don‚Äôt want to ruin that.

My father got the diagnosis in May for lung cancer, but we didn‚Äôt worry, as he had promised me he‚Äôd be there to walk me down the aisle. Merely moths later, just this week, he had felt terrible and was admitted to the hospital. Shockingly, they had said everything was looking spectacular and the cancer had started breaking up once more, with only one shot of chemo.

Not two days later, we bring him in for a test and I get a call to visit the hospital. Thank God for my brother in law, he told me the news. He‚Äôs been an amazing support system, having lost many family members himself. In the way there, I somehow cycled through the stages of grief.

I felt empty. I didn‚Äôt cry, I tried to speak, I just knew something was wrong. Eventually I lashed out, anger getting the best of me. I wasn‚Äôt angry at him nor my father or the nurses taking care of him, I was angry at the world- at myself.

I calmed down and I simply cried. I guess it came in waves, as I was mostly okay at the hospital. It‚Äôs hard seeing a parent with oxygen hooked in their nose and a billion contraptions and machines working around him. I didn‚Äôt want to be sad in front of him, my father is the closest person to me.

I so badly wanted him to be there to see me in my white dress. I‚Äôm only 18, and I‚Äôve never dated anyone before, so it was a bit of a stretch, but we kept hope. Now, I have prom on November 23rd and I‚Äôm simply praying that he can see me all dressed up for that special occasion. 

It isn‚Äôt fucking fair this happens. I didn‚Äôt think it was going to, it seems almost outlandish.

My (30F) father (49) was diagnosed with bladder cancer last June. He has his bladder removed in hopes they caught it in time, but unfortunately it had spread. He's been so strong, a real trooper. He's undergone two types of chemo, radiation, and immunotherapy. I saw it deteriorate my poor father so much, but he fought through it all. He finally was on a chemo that was getting rid of his cancer which is amazing! 

But Wednesday morning came along and my world was flipped upside down. My Dad was supposed to go in for a blood transfusion as he had been feeling quite woozy for the few days prior. (He's no stranger to needing blood transfusions, but he felt a bit more dizzy than usual. Very out of breath too.) When he woke up he was in so much pain, he thought he had a kidney infection or something similar. (He's also no stranger to these as he has an ostomy bag and more susceptible to infections.) When he tried to sit up he said it felt like something ""popped"" inside him, so my Mom called an ambulance and he was rushed in at around 930am. At about 10pm she received a call from him saying that they discovered he has flesh eating disease and was going in for surgery. Since it was on his back they had to remove skin and tissue until they reached healthy tissue, so basically until he started bleeding. My Mother raced down there and saw him before he went in for surgery. The doctor warned them both that with his immune system being so weak, there was a chance he wouldn't make it out of surgery, but my Dad wants to fight it and went for surgery. He made it out, but the infection had spread and they were hesitant about another surgery. We opted for a second one and he thankfully made it through! He is unfortunately very heavily sedated so he cannot respond to us, is on a breathing machine, and an incredible amount of IV's. I still talk to him and tell him I'm there and that I love him though. 

Today I felt like everything came to a halt. My Mother called my brother and I and told us to get to the hospital because we had to help her make some decisions (the day nurses weren't letting more than one person in his room, which is unfortunately why I wasn't already there) with her. The DNR type of decision. She told us that the second wound hasn't stopped bleeding and when they tried to move him to see if they could cauterize it he went into cardiac arrest, so they had to stop and stabilize him. They did. They tried another cauterize procedure shortly after my brother and I got there, and did manage to get some done and keep his BP and heartbeat stable. His hemoglobin levels are still dangerously low and they're trying to keep that stable. Because of all this, he cannot continue with the chemo. The doctor told my Mom that he's not out of the woods yet and there is a possibility he could pass. When we left for the night his levels were still stable, but we were given a pager to take home incase something happens. It's now 5am and I cannot sleep. I just want to be by his side. 

He's still being strong and fighting, and I'm so fucking proud of him. 

I'm just not in a good place right now and need some support. If you read this all, thank you so much.",2020-08-15 19:07:11

Ok. Both granddads died of cancer. Not that old. In fact my fathers father was only 55 when he died. Then my grandmother passed. Cancer. 

In -98 my mom told me why she always was tired. My family didn‚Äôt tell me that they found out in -88 that she was ill. She passed in 2002. I was 19 then. It was a bit to early I think. She didn‚Äôt even turn 50. Messed me up that that they didn‚Äôt tell me sooner. 

I‚Äôve coped kinda ok I think. But I‚Äôm a bit numbed. 
My father got a new wife and since then I‚Äôm not unwelcome there but idk. Her children seem more important. We, (two men Ofcourse), never really talked about it. And when I‚Äôve tried he starts another conversation. 

Always joked that I‚Äôve had my share of the disease. 

So about a month ago. My wife got an x ray and they found a tumor in her kidney. Big one. 

We got two kids. 10 and 14. 

Things just settled down. Kind of. 
She‚Äôs through medical school and I‚Äôve got an ok job. But as you all know just getting through the week with preteens and teens and school and work. It‚Äôs a hassle. 

We tried to have it ‚Äúnormal‚Äù just until she went to hospital. 

Yesterday she had the op and by what I understand it went well. She‚Äôs in pain but seem ok. 

And on top of that it‚Äôs the coronathing so we can‚Äôt come visit at the hospital. 

Kids are super patient and are seemingly happy. 
But I know that they obviously are sad.  

And I‚Äôm here just passing time. I feel nothing and it scares me. 
I know I‚Äôm probably gonna break down in the coming days.

What is your advice for what I should do with this time? Should I take a leave of absence from work and stay at home during this time? My sister lives with her and has been her primary caregiver.

Also, shortly after my mom was diagnosed, I found out that I am pregnant. This will be her first grandchild. We told her right away and she was overjoyed.

He was complaining that he was having hallucinations and I urged him to see a doctor. He put it off for a while but eventually went and we found out he has a brain tumor. Last week we got the biopsy results, stage 4, inoperable.

 I can't believe how fast he's declining, in the past few weeks he's gone from able to mostly function independently, to being blind in one eye, the left half of his body is paralyzed and he has little awareness of time or his surroundings. To make things worse I have to quarantine for two weeks before I can see him. I have severe mental health problems and being alone for that long with this weighing on my mind feels absolutely cruel. I don't know how I'm going to cope, the second I'm alone I become overwhelmed with thoughts of him. I'm 26, I'm not ready to lose my dad.

I also worry about the rest of my family. My uncle (his brother) has lung cancer and doesn't have long either. I worry about my grandmother potentially losing both of her sons to cancer at the same time. She's in her mid 80's and I don't know if her heart could take it. Not to mention the thought of my mum living alone in our four bedroom family home.

Living through this pandemic with my dad is super stressful because he's a cancer patient who just went through radiation. He pretty much hasn't left our house since early March and I just want him to be able to go outside or into the public without the added stress.

But...holy fucking shit you guys...seeing literally 1 in 10-20 people wearing a mask and everyone else pretending like NOTHING is going on....it's beyond frustrating.

My therapist said that my anger and frustration is valid, but I just need to know if anyone else feels the same way.

I still can't believe it. He just came back from his chemo and I went to check up on him and he was unresponsive. My life is a complete and utter mess. I'm trying to keep it together and balance school/work and my mom is just so broken. 

I miss him a lot and I had no idea this would happen to him. There weren't any signs. Just one minute he was fine and the next he was gone. He was very stubborn and refused to get treated until we forced him to get checked out. We only found out he had cancer six weeks ago and now he's dead. 

Sure, him and I had our differences, but I just can't believe it. I've been putting in my all these past six weeks and I barely get any sleep cause I was constantly taking care of him. I just turned 19 a few days ago and I can't help but be sad about not having him with me for the rest of my life. I just had a normal conversation with him and the next thing I know he's dead.

My mum never included me in her ""plans"", she didn't want to upset me. It was Monday, 28th of Remember 2017 at 7pm when my mum and dad called to say she had cancer had come back and it spread. Lungs (explains the cough), liver, pelvis and spine (explains the aching). I was 5 months pregnant at the time and I remember first thinking ""how do I give up this baby so it's stem cells would cure her cancer"", then I cried for three days.

We had her for four more years.

She was mostly just mum during that time, we all but forgot that she was sick and if it wasn't for the dr appointments, the subtle cough that followed us wherever we went, and the shadow of the port on her her tshirt that for the most part was what was keeping her alive.

She read bed time stories for my babies and was there for their birth, she nagged me daily, and she never let it show that she was a time bomb.

Until Monday 6th of April, my sister was due to drive up to see my parents. She couldn't make it until the Tuesday but she too felt the sense of urgency, she knew she had to be there.

That day my mum tried to call me, I told her I was busy at work  and I was sorry. So she sent me a message telling me thank you, and how much she loved me.

When my sister eventually made it there, mum was in her home hospital bed unresponsive, the couldn't feel a pulse. It was there though, just faint. She's taken enough of her painkillers to make her organs start to shut down. She knew what she was doing, she wasn't an idiot. She was a smart, strong woman, who reminded me many a time when I was in my moody teen years that she once took enough pain killers to nearly kill her.

She decided for herself that she was ready to go. She waited for me to get there, but thanks to covid I couldn't be in the hospital. My dad signed over his rights to my sister so she could be in the room. I cried in the carpark under her window for hours. Thinking this was as close as I was ever going to get to my mum again. My best friend, my creator.

It was not without the kindness of the nurses caring for her that when it was time they snuck us onto the ward to be there by her bedside one last time. To hold her hand, tell her we loved her. 10 minutes. These angels gifted us the last 10 minutes of her 4 year fight, 10 minutes I can't imagine what I would be without.

I'm not a religious person but I'm the hour following I sat, holding her hand, and at some point, not at her last breath, some time after, she left. It was time to go. The room was quiet, we became a family of three.",2020-09-07 17:47:27

I keep thinking about how beautiful she was and how cancer sucked the life out of her. I keep thinking about how I‚Äôll never hear her voice again or ever hug her again.

They assume I've heard ""how are you"" 1000 times today

""Actually, you're the first person to say hello this week"" 

""Omg that sucks, I thought loads of people would want to speak""

""Honestly it's been a tough week, the house is a mess, I can't be bothered to cook, I'm tired and I feel beat""

""Can't wait for this lockdown to be over mate, maybe when this is all over maybe we can meet?"" 

The days feel long and the nights even longer

Its getting harder every night sitting alone feeling somber

The truth is I'm sad and I feel utterly alone 

Craving some normality, adult conversation, a quick call on the phone 

I don't know how to reach out, and to say that I'm not okay 

I don't know how much longer I can pretend that I'm coping, I wish I knew what to say 

Terrified of being a constant drain on those who I talk to the most

I laugh, I joke, I pretend all is well, ""did you see that new thing on Netflix, It had me totally engrossed""

Buzz buzz my phone lights up, thank fuck, time for some conversation

Nope, just another BBC news alert ""coronavirus is killing our nation"" 

I'm having trouble focusing and keeping myself busy

I've started to lose my patience with everyone around me, even my kids, Max and Izzy 

I'm not angry at anyone in particular, I'm angry at everything and everyone

in between the meloncholy and isolation I just wish this pandemic would do one 

I hope one day I can feel like me again, not this sad and lonely shell

Until then I'll just sit here in my house that's starting to feel like a prison cell


I posted this to my Instagram yesterday, had a few people message telling me how guilty they felt that they hadn't messaged and that was about it. This pandemic has mate things so much harder for me personally I don't know about the rest of you?",2020-06-12 06:13:57
Today‚Äôs ER experience for my mom with cancer,15,fo5x2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/fo5x2q/todays_er_experience_for_my_mom_with_cancer/,4,1585088563.0,"My mom, the sweetest angel of all time, has been battling ovarian cancer for the past three years. In January she was told she had six months to live‚Äî I immediately quit my career to move home a couple states to care for her while trying last resort treatments. She has quickly deteriorated, sleeps 23.5 hours of the day, hasn‚Äôt been able to walk to more than the bathroom, and has been losing the light in her eyes. It‚Äôs devastating. But this experience is solely to communicate how COVID-19 has effected this situation and to prepare anyone in this situation to work hard as an advocate for their loved one. And let me preface this experience by saying that I DO NOT BLAME OUR HEALTHCARE WORKERS BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IS HORRIBLY OVERWHELMING AND TERRIFYING.

Yesterday, I woke up in the morning, she had a low grade fever, extreme weakness, and was seriously confused. I immediately called her oncologist who told me to take her to the ER which I was beyond nervous to do because of COVID-19. On the way to the hospital she begins hallucinating, cannot communicate effectively, and of course is in terrible pain. I got her to the ER around 10:30am, they took her back and because of the virus wouldn‚Äôt allow me back. I tried to explain that she could not effectively communicate with someone and I needed to be able to speak with SOMEONE to go through her normal symptoms and the rapid onset of the new ones. They refused, shuffled me out the door and told me to wait in my car and a nurse would call me. I called around 5 times from my car, and walked in three additional times to try and speak to someone before I finally got a call at 3pm in which they told me that they were giving her a couple bags of blood because her hemoglobin was low (6.4). They were transferring her to the cancer unit and after getting blood she would be discharged. I was still not allowed to speak with anyone or visit (I was speaking with the man solely transporting her to her room).

I immediately began trying to reach her oncologist to explain that her hemoglobin was low.. it is AN issue but it is not THE issue. I talked to a triage nurse at the cancer center, not his triage nurse, who truly was an angel and listened and promised to relay my concerns. She did (thank God someone listened) and called me back to tell me I would get a call from the oncologist as he was in the room evaluating my mother in between 6-8pm.

6pm rolls around. I get a call that my mother has finally begun her first unit of blood. Which might i add, she hasn‚Äôt been fed the entire day‚Äî i had to call the floor and ask them to please give her some food which they obliged. At 6:45pm I get a call from the oncologist‚Äî he tells me I‚Äôm correct. That anemia does not cause this type of confusion. It‚Äôs either an infection or the cancer has metastasized to her brain. And that he is allowing me to be in the hospital for end of life purposes (again, thank God).

So I was able to get in around 8pm. She has begun on IV antibiotics and gets a CT scan of her brain today. They want to get her out of the hospital as soon as possible regardless because of the virus. It‚Äôs a whirlwind. And there is honestly nothing much to do about it but I wanted to put it out there because if anyone is facing a similar situation, i want them to be prepared to fight as hard as you can. Healthcare workers have SO much on their plate right now and things are slipping through the cracks. They are only human. But your human matters too. Be the best advocate that you can be during this time. It is hard and it is scary but they need you more than ever right now. 

My heart goes out to everyone during this time because this is absolute dog shit.",2020-03-24 22:22:43

Felt that my feelings were invalidated by the doctors. (asked if i'd rather want to see my mom weak from radiation or see her healthy from a natural treatment),16,jawaiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/jawaiy/felt_that_my_feelings_were_invalidated_by_the/,9,1602690148.0,"My mom has chosen to pursue natural treatment for her cancer. I don't agree with it personally, but I've come to terms with her decision and I am at peace with it.

Earlier today, I had a video call with the two doctors in charge of my mom's care, my brother, my step-sister, my step-dad, and myself. My step-dad is with my mom at the treatment facility, while me, my brother, and my step-sister can't visit them at the moment and we're overall a bit skeptic of the treatment.

All three of us mentioned we weren't discounting the treatment my mom chose to pursue. We all said it is still another valid form of treatment no matter how skeptical we are. During the call the doctors kept talking over us, never letting us finish our sentences. I thought we had valid worries, concerns,  and sentiments. Yet I believe the doctors were rude and being defensive. They wouldn't discuss with us the potential risks or negatives with natural treatment, only highlighting the positives. But then they'd throw conventional treatment under the bus, saying all the negative things about it not highlighting any of the positives. It was extremely biased.

I want to genuinely understand what's going on, but when the doctors are like this, it's very hard to. And then the worst part was, one doctor asked us would we rather see her weak from radiation or not. I DON'T WANT MY MOM TO BE IN THIS SITUATION AT ALL. And even though my brother and I could visit my mom, my step-dad said it was better not to since she was undergoing treatment for long hours during the day. And yet the doctor asked us WHY WE COULDNT IN SUCH AN ACCUSATORY MANNER. ALMOST AS IF HE THINKS WE DONT CARE ABOUT OUR MOM OR WANT TO SEE HER BETTER AND HEALTHY.

For fuck's sake I want to see her healthy and I want her to be cancer free, and I'm not religious but I hope to GOD that this treatment works because I know my mom will NEVER consider conventional treatment, like her mind is set. And because her mind is set, I won't force my views and thoughts onto her about conventional treatment. So I AT LEAST, want to be VISUALLY and FACTUALLY reassured that this treatment is working you know? Like I BELIEVE my mom is already feeling better. I don't doubt the emotional, spiritual, and mental aspect of this treatment. I only doubt the physical which can be reassured with PHYSICAL EVIDENCE. That's all I was asking for and I felt like the doctors' could care less about the feelings of her family you know?

I can't believe the doctors had the GALL to talk over our worries and then QUESTION US WHETHER OR NOT WE'D LIKE TO SEE MY MOM WEAK OR WHY WE COULDNT VISIT WHEN WE WERE ALREADY TOLD NOT TO???

I don't know. I'm just really upset after that video call. I wonder if there are other who felt like their feelings were invalidated by doctors because just FUCK

Edit: I voiced out how I was upset about the video call to my step-dad. All he had to say was that he understands but most doctors don't have bedside manners and to just let it go because staying upset causes cancer. I'm sorry but ?????? I didn't know that doctors got a free pass for being rude. And not to be consciously rude, but at this point anything and everything can cause cancer so I'd rather stay upset than continually have my feelings invalidated???????",2020-10-14 15:42:28
The nurse‚Äôs hard love today pushed me to be better at supporting my moms wellbeing.,14,j9hxne,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/j9hxne/the_nurses_hard_love_today_pushed_me_to_be_better/,18,1602495739.0,"The physical therapist came in to see my mom who was admitted to the ER today. She‚Äôs been severely dizzy for a few days and spent much of the time sleeping, no walks around the block like we used to a week before. No 3 meals a day, either with the start of the new chemo.

Mom and me were about to go out around the block of the lobby on her hospital floor when I first got to her room, but she sat down and said she was too dizzy a few times, so we didn‚Äôt.

Then the physical therapist came to evaluate her. They walked about 3 rounds together as the other nurse talked to me about how much encouragement is needed and crucial from family members for the cancer patients. It was emphasized to me that I needed to walk with her and I needed to phrase our walks differently, like, ‚Äúhey mom let‚Äôs go to the store together!‚Äù 

At this point I felt so guilty and terrible because I have been saying for a long time that I needed help, and here they were saying, I needed to do this, that I don‚Äôt have a choice really. That I need to be the strong link. I explained I‚Äôd like more help even a physical therapist to visit once a. Week basically so there are more people mom can interact with. The physical therapist said mom doesn‚Äôt need her to walk. She can walk fine, just needs encouragement.

The nurse told me when we eat meals we need to eat together so mom is encouraged to eat. And to make the food look appetizing even if it doesn‚Äôt take good to her. To ask her what she likes to eat everyday so I can get or make it for her and strike when she has even the smallest appetite.

I was feeling terrible today because mom was telling me she didn‚Äôt want to live again. It‚Äôs been hard to keep being optimistic when she says things like that to me‚Äîand I know, intellectually, her pain is there‚Äîand sometimes I side with her, I think about how we force people to be in pain, and why? Why do I force her to live for me, etc? Aren‚Äôt I doing that? Possibly? Then I try to be selfless or switch to a less self-satisfying perspective where I don‚Äôt want to lose her, where I feel really unready for that to happen, where I feel absolutely loss and broken, but try to understand her perspective that she doesn‚Äôt want to be in pain, none of it, that she doesn‚Äôt want to continue like this‚Äîand I think about sedation and how to best help her go peacefully when the time comes...

The nurse and physical therapist basically felt that she was depressed and not eating or walking because I wasn‚Äôt encouraging enough or spending enough company with her, or eating with her, or encouraging her harder to walk‚ÄîI started crying because I felt terrible (I usually do when someone tells me I‚Äôm doing a poor job at basically anything, it triggers this feeling of worthlessness) and it was happening here‚Äîbut their talk with me made me refocus. I‚Äôve been trying to say to myself that the pain isn‚Äôt about me (I agree and disagree) but if I refocus on my mom then she will eat and she will walk and she will find a reason to live.

It‚Äôs all easier said than done. I felt resentful when they pulled me aside to say that. But after a few tears , I walked back into moms room and started up wrapping the food my aunt made for her. I began unwrapping while she was telling me she couldn‚Äôt eat because she‚Äôll throw up. And I did my best talking about mundane things like my cat turning 11 and how we used to play ping pong in the porch when I was in 6th grade, the summer we didn‚Äôt have internet or tv. I said ‚Äúmom this soup is so good! And this meat is so tender! You have to try this! It‚Äôll be good for your gut.‚Äù And she was eating the congee, and she was eating a few pieces of meat, and by the end of the night she seemed more willing to live, more at peace.

It‚Äôs an ebb and flow. It‚Äôs hard and then it‚Äôs not‚Äîit‚Äôs hard and then it‚Äôs light. Then it feels like everything is okay, no matter the outcome, because we can share some laughs together and smiles while the sun sets outside her hospital room window. 

And I get to walk out that room saying ‚Äúsee you tomorrow! Love you.‚Äù Another day.",2020-10-12 09:42:19

Living to Die,15,i8s5fe,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/i8s5fe/living_to_die/,4,1597316522.0,"Around April my dad was diagnosed with a very aggressive form of brain cancer, we were told that he would live another 4-6 months. My family decided to keep him home (with no chemo/treatments as it‚Äôs pretty much futile at that point) in a hospice program so that he would be able to die in the house he loves surrounded by the family he loves. That being, it‚Äôs becoming more and more difficult to look at him. His deterioration is absolutely heartbreaking and I can‚Äôt help but cry whenever I see or think of him. He can‚Äôt eat, drink, move, see, and his breathing has become more labored and erratic recently and his fingers have started turning purple. He can‚Äôt do anything, and since he can no longer take his seizure medication there‚Äôs the risk that he can have one at any given moment. It‚Äôs like watching a helpless animal die and not being able to do anything about it. You don‚Äôt really grasp the concept of death until it‚Äôs right in front of you, slowly taking the one you love, and your just watching. 

I‚Äôve never been a good daughter and I know there are many things I should‚Äôve done differently. My dad was an alcoholic most of his life and still was until he got sick. When I was younger (around ~7-8) he got so drunk I couldn‚Äôt recognize who he was anymore, which for some reason left a deep scar and I began resenting my dad and any alcohol in general. He didn‚Äôt hurt me or anything but something in my young mind clicked saying that that isn‚Äôt your dad. The 10 years that followed I was straight cruel towards him. I hate myself for that because he loved me even when I was a bitch. I feel awful that my actual feeling of love and care for him came out when they told us he was going to die. I will undoubtedly live with the biggest regret of life of not being a good daughter. (Sorry if I sound like I‚Äôm having myself a pity party I just wanted to get that off my chest, I know this isn‚Äôt about me.)

I wish there was a way to euthanize terminally ill people, because no person deserves to live the way my dad and many others live. Just living in anguish, pain, and suffering to die. I hope that my dad‚Äôs death comes quicker because that‚Äôs the only thing that can stop him from suffering. The day I went to see him at the hospital is seared into my memory. In a very weak voice, he asked me a very coherent question that caught me off guard, ‚ÄúWhen am I going to get better?‚Äù.

Edit: My dad has just passed away, he did so around 3:00 am 8/13. May his soul RIP.",2020-08-13 11:02:02

But I need an outlet and support. In January 2018 I was diagnosed with stage 4 msbc, my torso was riddled with it.  I was very active so I thought all the pain was from slipped discs and the activity around the farm. No, I had broken ribs and my spine looked like Swiss cheese (exactly what the er nurse said).   This put me in a wheel chair, then a walker, after 6 months of that I could finally get around with little help.   With continued treatment and quarterly scans, in February 2020 we find out it‚Äôs moved to some lymph nodes and my liver.  This year I had 6 rounds of chemo, lost all my long curly red hair (which was my security blanket and mask). The chemo did kick it out of my liver, but it‚Äôs still in some lymph nodes.

I wish I could make things better for him.

Today I‚Äôm thinking about his journey ahead. He doesn‚Äôt look well enough to have chemotherapy, but I know it is the important next step for him due to lymphatic spread. I hope he can put on some more weight and build up more strength beforehand.

I opened up to some people and they did give me their loving support and thoughts and kind (even encouraging words). But what is interesting this came from people that lost a dear loved one and all expressed the same thing:

My wife passed last week after 4 long years of trying to survive a stage 4 NPC diagnosis.  During this ordeal I learned that as much as I respected and admired her for the strong and powerful lady that she was, her strength in being able to lift each foot and keep walking down the path of hope, even when hope ran out, through all the pain, fear, doubt, hope/no hope, tears, brief jubilations and always always love, grew each day.  Her example is also what is going to keep me going raising her kids.

But I was her caregiver during all of this and she asked me something that I was never able to answer.  Why do we say ‚Äúfighting‚Äù cancer?  It always bothered her because to her it meant that no matter how hard you worked at getting rid of it, cancer could ‚Äúwin‚Äù and you‚Äôd be a ‚Äúloser‚Äù.  She rejected that.  And the way I see it, she gained 4 more years with her children after being given scant months.  Cancer didn‚Äôt ‚Äúwin‚Äù, she didn‚Äôt ‚Äúlose‚Äù, but I lack the vocabulary.  She never let cancer define who she was.  She never let anyone define who she was.  She simply was her.  And I miss her greatly as do her kids.

My father has 3-6 months to live. How can i make this time perfect as it can be for him?,16,fxk7ny,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/fxk7ny/my_father_has_36_months_to_live_how_can_i_make/,12,1586428499.0,"Im looking for people ideally with a bit of experience in this because i am struggling myself. My dad of 53 years was diagnosed with terminal cancer on 11/03/20 and whilst our family are being as supportive as we can he has gone from being able to walk  and drive round freely, to being wheelchair bound and in need of constant care. He is really struggling to come to terms with this, we have created a Facebook for him and got him in contact with old friends which has helped slightly 

Finances are not great and he is in constant worry about leaving us short of money,  He has a pension that was due to finish next year but he won't see next year, unfortunately.

There are a good nights, where our family have a good laugh but when the conversation drops or silence falls for a short while i can see him thinking. I always say 'whats on your mind' so i can share his pain so he's not alone and tonight he just replied 'i just dont want to go, im not ready' to which theres a lot of tears and hugs. He's was scared of the dark as a kid because he beleived that if there was darkness he would not wake up. Now that fear has come back and we have a night light for him which helps a bit but not completely.

I am from the UK just outside of London and becuase he is classed as extremely vulnerable to Covid-19 we have not chanced going outside for a walk yet, also because he has been sleeping so much due to the codeine, morphine etc a walk just hasn't been practical however were ooking to change that.

What I'd ultimately like to know is how i can make this short time I've got with him the most fulfilling and the best quality time that could be given to him. We are making my older brother power of attorney and have slowly started taking control of his finances to alleviate the stress as he can't cancel direct debits let alone call his pension fund without crying. What can i do to make him feel looked after, comfortable. I'd honestly give up my anything from chocolate to my limbs if it would mean  thay he could survive this shitty tumour in his brain. 

If you got this far, thankyou. Any advice would be appreciated",2020-04-09 10:34:59
"Long time poster, first time lurker... I guess I need some humor to get by. My wife has a rarer form of breast cancer, started the fight with Chemo today and found out they found it in her liver. I‚Äôm lost, scared and just need to get it out, process, and maybe get some advice from all of you",15,fuhcka,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/fuhcka/long_time_poster_first_time_lurker_i_guess_i_need/,9,1585979603.0,"So like the title says a few weeks ago my wife was diagnosed with invasive pleomorphic lobular carcinoma. Not ultra rare but the pleomorphic makes it a bit more rare and aggressive. One good note for us was although it‚Äôs aggressive it doesn‚Äôt like to move around fast, it stays in situ more often than not. During her initial biopsy the lymph nodes were clear so things didn‚Äôt look so bad, seemed to be in situ. 

I am on disability from a work injury and headed toward permanent disability and my work cut my private insurance off just prior to this diagnosis. Whatever I couldn‚Äôt afford to have my wife on it anyway. So gonna go bankrupt paying for insurance but I got her covered on a solid insurance plan. I want her to have the best care even if it wipes me out financially.

So it‚Äôs been a long few days as her insurance went live April 1st. Bone scan, then mediport placement and CT yesterday and Chemo this morning. This COVID-19 issue stops me from going into most of her stuff including her oncologists this morning. So my wife who already has bad anxiety issues had to hear that this has metastasized to her liver alone. It‚Äôs breaking my heart as I am always with her at the dr for anything as she gets very anxious even for routine stuff.

So here I am with my wife sleeping next to me on the bed trying to process all of this. None of it is good news but it‚Äôs not the worst news. In the middle I suppose. Good stuff is her bone scan was clear, the liver seems to be a small spot and the dr isn‚Äôt changing the treatment course at this time as she is already on a strong, hard hitting path. So we are going with that we are not gonna flip our lids until the Dr gets worried. 

In the end I am at a loss, for 16 years I‚Äôve been her rock, pulled us through some serious crap and for the first time in my life I feel unprepared, lost and don‚Äôt know what to do for her. I‚Äôm strong with her but break down whenever I‚Äôm not near her (shower, out in the yard etc..). Everyone I know says I‚Äôm the strongest person they know and here I sit feeling totally broken and helpless.

I don‚Äôt know what to do, I don‚Äôt want to lose her, I don‚Äôt know how to keep strong this time, I don‚Äôt know how to fight this one. I‚Äôm scared.

If you read this far thank you, I don‚Äôt know that there is anything anyone can tell me but hang on, follow the drs orders and fight like hell. But I‚Äôve never been here before so I reach out to this community for support and advice. Thank you all.",2020-04-04 05:53:23

My mom has been fighting against cancer for 3 1/2 years now. Going through multiple surgeries & treatments, that all stopped showing results after some time. Right now she‚Äôs in hospital after having brain surgery because of a large metastasis & has to stay another 10 days for radiotherapy. At this point we are all fully aware, that her time on this earth is very very limited. She‚Äôs being strong for a long time and within the last few months her energy & will to live just faded so quickly. 
Naturally all I want to do is spend time with her, which is really difficult right now. The hospital‚Äôs guidelines are extremely strickt about visitors & only allow one visitor per day. Still me and my sister tried to visit our mom today. She is underage & couldn‚Äôt come to visit, if nobody would drive her. As the virus cases are rapidly increasing right now, we‚Äôre afraid it would soon  be impossible to visit her at all. Also I couldn‚Äôt handle visiting alone, because im just not emotionally stable enough to be in this environment of illness & death, plus seeing my mom in this condition, all alone. But the hospital staff denied us access together, so only one of us could visit. As my sister couldn‚Äôt come there on her own, I told her to go through. I was so sure, that I would have the courage to explain our situation, but I just couldn‚Äôt speak. Instead I just ran out & broke down crying. I knew it was absolutely helpless, because the staff was just doing there jobs and helping the greater cause of fighting this virus. I understand and I respect that.

Mom in hospice,14,hvaejd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/hvaejd/mom_in_hospice/,5,1595377358.0,"My mom was diagnosed in May 2019 with stage 4 lung cancer after her femur broke due to a lesion on the bone. She had no symptoms aside from the leg pain (which she thought was maybe something with her knee at first). She also had extreme back pain, which eventually lead to a CT scan which also helped diagnose her cancer. She was a smoker back in the 70s, but quit in the early 80s. Not sure if the type she had was due to smoking (she was in denial for most of this and never asked questions or did any sort of research). She had surgery then and was in rehab for the leg, putting any treatment on hold for her lungs. After she got out of the rehab, she started radiation on her leg and started immunotherapy with Keytruda every 3 weeks. 

During this time she had to eventually have a port inserted into her lungs to drain them due to fluid filling up in her lungs. She was constantly uncomfortable as it hurt to lay down, and even if she found a comfortable position, she felt like she couldn‚Äôt breathe. Eventually the fluid stopped, which was a relief, and she started getting good news with her scans. 

Fast forward to November when she started getting extreme upper back pain and unbearably tingly arms. She ended up having surgery on her spine due to another lesion causing a fracture in her vertebrae. She never felt relief after the surgery. 

Since about March she has been in extreme pain and her scans showed additional tumors. Her oncologist suggested chemo (which I‚Äôm not sure why that wasn‚Äôt the first thing he recommended upon diagnosis). She‚Äôs always been terrified of chemo and didn‚Äôt want to do it. She wanted the opinion of my two sisters and I and we wanted her to do it. She started on it but only made it maybe 4 or 5 times before she was too weak for it. 

End of June, she was in so much pain she was admitted to Rush Hospital in Chicago, where she‚Äôs been ever since. No visitors due to COVID of course, but the last time I talked to her was Friday and she was crying and in pain and said the staff told her she should give up (she said those weren‚Äôt their actual words but that was the gist of the conversation). I told her not to give up. We hung up abruptly just because it‚Äôs hard for her to handle the phone anymore physically. 

On Saturday my sister told me she was moving to an area in the hospital where they were going to work on pain management. By Sunday when my dad and my sister went to see her (I was out of town), she was already unconscious. My sister said she looked like death. 

I came home early from my trip I was on and went to see her. I wasn‚Äôt prepared for how she looked. She really does look like the living dead. The nurse said she has ‚Äúdays‚Äù and will call us when it‚Äôs hours. I just cannot believe this happened and she declined so quickly. On Friday she was talking about how she would be coming home Monday (the 20th). 

I have so much guilt now. I wish we didn‚Äôt push her to try chemo, I wish I called her more (albeit whenever I did call, she was sleeping according to my dad). I cant ever forget that last conversation listening to her crying and feeling so helpless. And I won‚Äôt ever forget what she looked like when I walked in the room. This is the first time I‚Äôve experienced having a loved one with cancer and I just wasn‚Äôt prepared for the toll it takes on a body. She lost over 100 pounds and was unrecognizable. 

Thanks for reading, I just wanted to write it out. I‚Äôm surprisingly good about it until I see or talk aloud about her. I‚Äôm worried for my dad. He is 84 (she just turned 70 this year), and is not in the best health. He‚Äôs on oxygen and is on a walker. He can‚Äôt drive or do much. He doesn‚Äôt want to go see her anymore after he saw her Sunday. I think he‚Äôs beyond shocked because on Saturday he said she was excited to finally get to see them and she never did as she was already unconscious. It makes me sad that he doesn‚Äôt want to see her anymore, but I know he‚Äôs got his own way of dealing with things. I just pray she goes gently and sooner rather than later. I don‚Äôt want to see her like this, but knowing right now she is not in pain is better to take. I just can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm never going to see my momma awake again or hear her voice. 

One thing I‚Äôm thankful for is in late June, my sisters and I took her wig shopping and she bought a wig that made her smile again and wore it right out of the shop. We had a nice lunch and I know it made her very happy. I can‚Äôt believe that was just a month ago. 

The nurse said she can hear people talking to her. Do you believe this to be true? I don‚Äôt know how you could know that. I talked to her yesterday but it was very hard.",2020-07-22 00:22:38

Radiation Specialist confirmed that there‚Äôs no cancer present anywhere beside the 8cm tumor, only a small spot in a lymph node that is too insignificant to consider concerning.

I am so unbelievably relieved. At this point, he‚Äôs looking at 3 months of hardcore chemo/radiation to shrink the tumor and then surgery.

For example, one of my friends has lost her mother, brutally she didn't have the chance to say goodbye keeps telling me ""but she's still here, enjoy it, do this and do that etc"" when I tell her how hard it is to see her like this and see her suffer. I don't want to compare, both situations are different but she tends to think she knows everything when she doesn't because she's never been through this.

I'm not saying my situation is worse but that it's different and I really can't listen to these ""advice"" people give me like they know what I'm going through..  Just be there for me, listen to me but don't tell me what to do if I didn't ask... 

And oh I'm just annoyed by people asking me how she's doing when they know the situation... Like how could she be? She can't get better! Arghh

Am I normal or a terrible person? :(

He has Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin‚Äôs Lymphoma. Now I know prognosis for this cancer is very very good. 

But, his heart cannot take chemo anymore. His heart has permanent scarring and his aortic valve is hardened and needs to be replaced. We cannot afford the treatment also. His lungs are getting hardened because of radiation. The doctors have given him the time frame of 1 year to 3 years, with still having hope that radiotherapy with immunotherapy can work.

He never wanted to treat his cancer. He would say sometimes to let him go but he still went to all of his treatments. Now, ever since the time was given, he says every morning that he doesn‚Äôt want to go to the hospital, which never used to happen before. He just wants to stop. He goes to the hospital only because of me. That‚Äôs it, not even for his family anymore. Just me. Because I broke down crying when he told me the time frame.

Some part of the treatment was his undoing. He deteriorated quickly. The last time I saw my father, he was unable to use the restroom by himself.

All of my siblings live around the country: I‚Äôm in the South, two sisters in the West, a brother in Hawaii. We‚Äôve flown in to help as we can then Covid hit.

This last visit to the ER will likely be his last. They did an MRI of his torso and the cancer has spread. He has been sent home to be as comfortable as possible until he transitions. I have been for the most part numb for the last year or so. My father was unable to attend my daughter‚Äôs wedding, his first grandchild. I was supposed to visit him in March, then the pandemic hit. 

I am so torn. Do I drive up just to hold his hand and listen to music one last time? He doesn‚Äôt seem to be coherent anymore. I feel like I have let go months ago.

She wakes up for short periods of time (30 seconds up to a couple minutes) usually when she is in pain. She is not very coherent at all, however there have been a few moments where she does make sense. I know she can hear us talking. She told me she loved me earlier, which was great to hear. We talk to her quietly throughout the day and hold her hand. We also have to get her up a little to change her bed pads and diaper. I‚Äôm really scared of how the medicine is affecting her on a completely empty stomach. I‚Äôm worried the morphine is causing her death to come quicker, but since she cries out in pain and asks us for help, I know she needs it. I hate that she is suffering. It‚Äôs soul shattering to know there is so little we can do to help her. I‚Äôm just so confused, and part of me wishes it would just end so she can be at peace and stop struggling. Would anyone else be willing to share their story about being with a loved one in their final hours/days? Is this normal what she is going through? I just want her to have a dignified and comfortable death...",2020-06-08 10:19:56
I saw the worst things of my life this week,14,gpqvud,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/gpqvud/i_saw_the_worst_things_of_my_life_this_week/,6,1590360580.0,"My mom died yesterday at home in her bed.  She had only been home from the hospital for 9 days.  This stuff moved so quickly at the end.  The doctors said  a couple months or less, and to enjoy the summer, and 11 days later she was gone. She spent her last 3 days in what seemed to be a unresponsive coma

Anyway I don't even know how to type it out but there's like 5 major things that happened that I'll never forget and it's just so shocking that it happened so fast and shocking that my mother had to go through this. Like one day yea she's weak and unable to do anything but you have a good day with family and she's not in pain and you think ""maybe we'll get to do this for a while"".  Then the very next day it all becomes real when she collapses like a limp sack of potatoes in your arms on the 10 step walk to the master bathroom. Then I realize she'll never leave her bed again. Then the confusion, the unintelligible responses, the faces she'd make, biting the blanket and the worst were the convulsions. Yesterday was a really nice day outside when she died and the whole neighborhood was outside and I just kept thinking ""if you only knew the horrors that were happening inside these walls this week""  

Unless you've been there you don't know what it's like. It was the scariest, saddest, most helpless feeling I've ever had in my life.",2020-05-24 22:49:40

Eventually the dr sent her to a cancer specialist who told us almost immediately that it was probably cancer but we needed to figure out what type, that was on valentines day. Since they figured out she had stage four non small cell lung cancer. Immediately they started radiation then chemo. The chemo tore her up horribly, then when I took her to her Dr for blood work one day they said her blood pressure and white blood count were way too low so they sent her to the er. The er saw that her heart was arhythmic so they started trying to treat her. Within two days she had several mini strokes, which as it turns out was from clots going to her brain, with the chemo messing her up so bad they couldn't give her much blood thinner so the situation got worse fast. They were set to send her home on palliative care when she suddenly passed away. 

I myself have had 3 surgeries this year one planned the other two not so much. I was in the middle of recovering from back to back surgery when she went into the hospital, was struggling because our stimulus still hadn't came and I've been our of work with no pay for over a month. All of the stress and emotions from this are piling on me a bit, I had already lost my father when I was 21 to staff infection from diabetic complications so its very hard. Add in one of my sisters going to face book and causing drama about how much she loved mom and make up stuff about no one allowing her to make decisions when for most of her adult life she treated my mom like a doormat, made her cry, and barely ever came to see her.

My dad (66yrs) got diagnosed with a glioblastoma 5 months ago and I (F,26) have been taking care of him, together with my mom, since then. he had an operation and the healing part went great considering the diagnosis. he finished his therapy (radio+chemo) a month ago and even before then (3 weeks into therapy) he started to be weaker and weaker. First I thought ""ok its bcuz of the radiation duuh"" but last week we got a confirmation that the ""leftovers"" of the tumor have grown a lot since december. even though i kinda knew, it still hit me, harder then the first time, when I was with him in the hospital for his first check up, thinking ah, he is just getting more and more confused because he is getting old and then boom - fking cancer. anyway, it doesn't look to good. I will talk in two days with his neurosurgeon because the doc at the oncology is a douchebag. just another number in his eyes i think, ya know. 

Now here is the thing, I cant look at him and I hate myself for saying that. My depression has reached the peek I think this week. I just want to hug him and tell him everything will be fine but I just cant...he looks at me with sad eyes, he ain't stupid. he IS one of the most inteligent people I have ever met ...my dad and I never had a great relationship, never like im his princess or he is my daddy...he always put work on first place and then the family, but Im not hating on that, what do I gain from that anyway? i want to spend more time with him, but its hard...he can't talk properly anymore, he is slowly losing the ability to walk, etc...all hospices are full here so atm we get some help from a sister who visits...and he hates that, i can so clearly see that he is fed up and that all he wants to do is to drive his car and play cards with his old friends and make contracts of some business bs idk...im lost, so lost and so scared...i want to make him smile, thats all i want. a sincere smile from my dad, not a pitty smile just to calm me. I never got to meet him and see him fully how he is as a person because he wasn't always home, mostly to nap or to sleep and eat...just work work...so idk what he really loves or what i could do to cheer him a liiiitle bit, just a tiny bit..i owe him that, at the end of the day i respect and love him..I would show him all the pictures of his projects he has done, but im scared that that might depress him even more or that he won't know what i'm showing him...fuck cancer, seriously.

The words rang through my ears and I felt everything around me reeling for a moment.  Not at 35.  We have children, two boys who are just aged 6 and 1. Our plan was to have another baby when the youngest went on to pre-k but slowly I felt that dream slip away.  We had been putting off a vacation to Europe to see some of my husband's family there for when the kids are older, because we thought that we'd have the time.  I slowly mulled over a dozen things that we planned to do once our children were older and now....I knew.  I felt it in my gut that it wasn't an early stage.  I can't explain how, I just knew. Two days later we planned an impromptu family outing to have a little quality time before the chaos of appointments,  surgery and chemo began. We never made it, on the way the vomiting began and the loss of blood. 4 days in the hospital and a few appointments later my fears were confirmed, stage 4 cancer.  

I can't explain the dread that I have now.  I am typically the person who sees the bright side of any situation, who doesn't realize that things were really hard until I reflect back on what I've been through.  Now, I don't feel like we have more than a few years with my husband.  It's an overwhelming feeling that doesn't feel in anyway like pessimism but more like a premonition.  I don't dare share this feeling with anyone else and I constantly adopt a brave ""we're going to fight this"" demeanor; I feel guilty though, that I'm not blindly optimistic like my family and friends around us and I have a very deep feeling of dread for what the future holds.  Is this completely crazy?  I keep on thinking of things that we can do as a family to make memories and make the most of our time, I figure that whatever the future holds that at least we will have spent our time wisely.

My time since then has been a mix of guilt about not being around to help more (my family and I live 1800 miles away), worry about how her family (husband and two young daughters) is going to cope with both treatment and (potentially) mourning, and outright sadness about very likely losing my sister and friend.

There were a few months this Summer where treatment seemed to be going well and we got our collective hopes up... but a follow-up scan this Fall revealed growth in some known tumors and several new tumors.

Seeing and talking with her over Thanksgiving (last week), she acknowledged that things are getting/feeling worse week by week.  Which doesn't give me hope that she has much time left.

As someone whose work relies heavily on mental focus and creative thinking, trying to get _anything nontrivial_ done has been a struggle.  Unfortunately, I'm not in a position to _not_ work for the coming weeks/months (especially since I'm going to need that time off for emergency visits as things progress ‚Äî being thousands of miles away makes this even more logistically difficult).

It‚Äôs too much; too long of a story, too private (I realized as I started typing), so I‚Äôm just gonna give the bare bones for now. 

My dad is 67, a few months ago he started acting weird and tried to keep it from my sister (39) and I (26). Between the 2 of us we pieced together that he had cancer in the brain. 

At one point it seemed like he was doing better - he was in the hospital getting treatments, had all these big plans for when he was released... 

But now it‚Äôs bad again. He‚Äôs staying with my sister, thank God. I‚Äôm not in the same state anymore, and don‚Äôt have the financial means to take care of him. But he seems worse to me. 

I went there for a week to help her out and to see him, found out from medical papers that she got from his doctor that he doesn‚Äôt JUST have it in the brain, no, it‚Äôs adenocarcinoma, it started in his LUNGS, and spread to his STOMACH and BRAIN. He‚Äôs in stage 4. 

I can‚Äôt even think about it without crying tbh. 

My sister is very into holistic methods, so she‚Äôs trying whatever she can, trying to get him to eat foods with less sugar both for his diabetes and because she read that it can starve cancer cells. 

He‚Äôs stubborn though, he wants to do things HIS way, he feels like he has no freedom. That she‚Äôs taking his choices away, even though his choices (like wanting milkshakes and candy bars) may make things worse. 

My sister told me he‚Äôs been refusing to eat lately. Anything. That he wants to give up. That he yells at her that he wants freedom and isn‚Äôt sick (he definitely is, he slept most of the day, everyday when I was there, got confused easily, moods and temper up and down, is skin and bones from not eating properly for a while). He‚Äôs tried to leave her before too, he doesn‚Äôt want to stay there but honestly I don‚Äôt think he can‚Äôt be on his own either. 

I feel like either way he‚Äôs going to go, and it‚Äôs either gonna be that he‚Äôs gonna shut us out and pass away out of sheer stubbornness (not eating I mean, since I don‚Äôt know if my sister‚Äôs methods are working or not), or he‚Äôll go from the cancer (a guarantee) but doing what he wants, and at least he wouldn‚Äôt be shutting us out. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I haven‚Äôt talked to him since I returned home. He doesn‚Äôt answer his phone and when I called my sister she doesn‚Äôt ask him if he wants to talk to me, so I guess he doesn‚Äôt. Idk. Maybe her head is just too filled from the stress. 

I was already stressed before all this, but now it‚Äôs just infinitely worse. I‚Äôm not even the one handling him on a daily basis or dealing with cancer, and still overwhelmed. It feels selfish. But I just don‚Äôt know what to do, for him or her.",2020-08-31 04:15:47

I got the dreaded phone call this morning from my mom. I knew this week her and my dad would find out the good or bad news of his endoscopy that yielded an unfortunate discovery of why he was having months of chronic acid reflux and indigestion. Last week they found a tumor, only 7mm in between his stomach and esophagus. It is cancer of the stomach and esophagus, is what his gastroenterologist said when she personally called my mom and dad on the results of his biopsy.  I heard the fear and worry in my mom's voice when she told me the news. Deep down I had feeling it was not going to be good news but I am trying to be positive for my mom. The scary part is what stage he will be diagnosed at with his cancer. I am really praying for 1 or 2. The thought of chemo, radiation and surgery for my dad and what he will have to endure is the hardest part to think about. I know he is a strong man and stubborn. He has my mom who is a rock to make sure he doing what he is told and keeping is diet in check with nutrition and making sure he does what the doctors want him to do.

Also, I am an only child, adult, and live 500 miles away from  my parents with a little family of my own. I have no siblings to lean into for comfort or support for the tough decision making that may come later.. It is just my mom and dad.  This is why I'm scared and worried he is going to leave this planet too soon and leave my mom on her own living far away.  But I know I can't think that way. 2020 is such shit year.

My sister was diagnosed.,11,h9asqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/h9asqn/my_sister_was_diagnosed/,6,1592232345.0,"Story: (We don‚Äôt know exactly what type And I don‚Äôt want predictions please)

My sister starting in April was having headaches and nausea on and off. It got so bad that she ended up going to a walk in clinic and they said they don‚Äôt know why but here are some headache and Amit nausea meds. It got worse and she ended up dehydrated with painful headaches and more nausea. She went to the ER and they  basically said she had a UTI and they couldn‚Äôt understand the nausea and just gave antibiotics and anti nausea.

It kept getting worse. She ended up in the ER twice in one day. Sent her home with the same meds. She was even worse that night and started piling up blood and her arm got numb and she was slurring her words. I called 911. Back at the ER...they did a CT and said she has a small brain lesion and that she needs to see a neurologist and get an MRI. The neurologist at that hospital didn‚Äôt think it was urgent enough to do an MRI there....and thought that she may be allergic to the nausea meds and changed to different ones.

They barely kept her at the ER just to get rehydrated. 

This was in the midst of corona virus so everything felt increasingly difficult.

Couldn‚Äôt get a neurologist because my sister didn‚Äôt have insurance. I got her an eye appointment though because maybe she just couldn‚Äôt see.

The optometrist she saw noticed her right optic nerve was bleeding and inflamed and sent us to the ER at a different hospital. 

They did an MRI. Found the brain lesion and and nodules and confirmed the optic nerve inflammation and bleeding. 

They did a lumbar puncture to relieve the pressure. She was admitted for 5 days on steroids while they did tests and CT‚Äôs and MRI‚Äôs to figure out what all of was.

They all seemed to point to Neurosarcoidosis  and also some type of possible inflammatory disorder.

She was feeling better and her right eye healed. She started tapering off her steroids and her head began to ache again. 

Another MRI and 2 days later we get a call that the lesion had grown and that they did an MRI on different parts of her body. She has nodules on her spine and neck. 

They scheduled emergency brain surgery for the day after. The day of surgery the surgeon took me aside and said it was a malignant tumor and thinks it‚Äôs possibly lymphoma. 

Only I could be in the hospital. I called my family. We decided to wait until she was more coherent the next day to tell her. The neuro surgeon ended up telling her she had cancer after coming out of the recovery room. Still looopy.

All she could do was close her eyes and keep them closed and put her thumbs up. 

I had to leave and couldn‚Äôt stay cuz visiting hours. I felt terrible for leaving. 

Since only once visitor a day. I drove my disabled mom back and fourth and my other sister would take turns visiting the ICU. My father died of Leukemia 11 years ago. So, it‚Äôs like reliving another nightmare. 

I droppped my mom off and just got home. When I get a panicked call from her. That I needed to come back. I need to be up there. It‚Äôs not good. 

I asked what was wrong and she was so panicked she couldn‚Äôt say and she said just get here the nurse said it was okay.

I called my other sister and we both rushed off to the hospital and cried our way in. 

I talked to my mom and sister....the neuro surgeon had updated my mom about stuff that I had already known and his theories of what it could be which sounded aggressive and terminal. 


It really hit hard and was scary and we were all crying. My sister couldn‚Äôt get the name. The nurse came in and helped calm us down and they had the oncologist pay a visit to better clarify. I asked what type...what stage etc. 

She said they didn‚Äôt know. They have some thoughts but they won‚Äôt know for sure because some things don‚Äôt fit what that typical cancer would be. She‚Äôs very rare. 

samples were sent to the University of San Francisco and University of Washington. She said she‚Äôd know the day after.

The house supervisor allowed us all to be in the room when the oncologist came in. We met her and she said we still don‚Äôt have answers but good news is that the University of Washington would take her case on. They‚Äôre one of the best. 

My sister had been in the hospital for 8 days. Had brain surgery. A shunt placed from her head to her stomach to relieve the pressure of spinal fluid and then they had to re-adjust the shunt again. 3 surgeries. 

She‚Äôs finally home today. It was nice and now I‚Äôm here with her and it‚Äôs been a crazy time. I‚Äôve never really had anxiety attacks but I‚Äôve had so many in the past week or so. I‚Äôve broken down countlessly just crying out of no where.

My family depends on me to be the calm, collective and decisive one. The one that knows and will be there. I‚Äôm the oldest sister and my mom has a hard time understanding and getting around. 

My sister that has cancer is 28 years old. The youngest. She is the angel of the whole family. The most generous, giving, loving, nature loving person I know. It She was so set on hiking the Pacific Crest Trail this year. She was ready to head out but because of corona and the headaches it was postponed. She had been saving and training for over a year. It just really hits hard. 

When talking to her she is the most relaxed about it but we know she has her moments. When it‚Äôs discussed her answer always is, ‚ÄúIt is what it is. I have cancer and all cancer is bad.‚Äù

Only once she quickly blurred out her death wishes. 

I can‚Äôt imagine my life without her. I‚Äôm pretty scared of the appointment we will have with the doctors at UW. 

I don‚Äôt know if I believe in God but I never speak of her cancer as a thing that can‚Äôt be put into remission. I like to think that I can speak it into existance . That her doctors will say, ‚ÄúShe has cancer and if she keeps up with treatment. She will live a long and happy life.‚Äù

That‚Äôs my story. I do have a loving husband by my side and my mom and middle sister...we are all very close.

Feel so alone - rant of feelings not expecting any responses just didn‚Äôt know where to post my pain,12,gwqak5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/gwqak5/feel_so_alone_rant_of_feelings_not_expecting_any/,2,1591333746.0,"My Mother has terminal PPC, has had surgery and lots of chemo to prolong and has been through sepsis and ICU stay in Winter 2018-  we thought we were losing her. She was dx in Spring 2018. Bowel obstructions have been her main issue. 
She has had increasing pains, that are thought to be cancer regrowing where it‚Äôs been shrunk before and she‚Äôs constantly sick and got aches- sometimes she‚Äôs alright and until the pain last week was painting walls and what have you.
She‚Äôs been shielding for 12 weeks, we haven‚Äôt seen her for 14. I had my first baby in January so she could be a Nan and I could have her around. Then covid hit and has taken so much precious time I‚Äôm utterly crushed inside. She‚Äôs met her twice in four months of her little life. We live too far for window waving and she got to the point it would break her heart to see us so far away. 

So she‚Äôs been moved to a hospice from hospital to symptom manage, hopefully for three weeks or less. She can‚Äôt manage at home. Oncologist has reluctantly agreed to a regime of Caelyx- if she can overcome this breakthrough pain.

I‚Äôm utterly heartbroken. She is a single parent, no other family. My sister is 18 and lives with her and the dog, and our other sister is 25 (doesn‚Äôt really make any effort and hasn‚Äôt since diagnosis to spend any time with her, despite nearly losing her and being begged by our Mum to spend some time together-). 18 yo doesn‚Äôt have a dad or other family she will be left alone.
Mine and our useless sisters Dad has helped a bit but through me texting and asking as he lives a few miles away.
His family is what I thought my family too. But my siblings haven‚Äôt even been in touch to ask how I am or any of us. In fact they‚Äôve never bothered since Mum was diagnosed. Anyone will tell you ive tried loads. They have stayed at mine  and I always make effort. Never anything back. Self absorbed teens. My baby girl has come along and still nothing. Annoyed I wouldn‚Äôt allow photos on IG because clearly, my baby is all about their attention. My baby hasn‚Äôt been well on a few occasions and no one has been in touch. Now this is happening and I feel alone.
I have my Oh for support. We are executors of the Will and from the beginning I‚Äôve had to do everything and face the realities, fight for her to remain on ventilation in ICU. I‚Äôm in oncology meetings, as a support. It‚Äôs as if people see me as some robot who isn‚Äôt allowed emotions.
Of us three girls I am closest to her. 
She loves her granddaughter and it‚Äôs painful to see her so sore and so sad on FaceTime.

Today my sisters were awful on Twitter- radio silence for months as usual (until they want somewhere to stay for a concert etc then they‚Äôre in touch as I live in a big city.) 

I don‚Äôt know why. This whole BLM movement is amazing but they‚Äôve gone from not caring about anyone but themselves to performist activism and I feel like screaming ‚Äúhello your eldest sister is lonely and sad in lockdown miles away with a new baby and mother in hospice?‚Äù So because I RT someone‚Äôs (fair) comment about social distancing not being honoured at protests and how this is upsetting those who are shielding and are frightened. A second spike will inevitably mean we can‚Äôt say goodbye or hold her. If we can‚Äôt see her and she passes in that hospice I might never recover from that pain.
I retweeted, I have no comment on the BLM I‚Äôm not fighting for that I can‚Äôt see beyond my day with my baby girl and this situation. 
She is 16 and commented a nasty comment, as if I didn‚Äôt care about the cause.
Now five minutes ago these teenagers couldn‚Äôt give a damn and had no idea or maturity to understand the gravity of institutional racism. It‚Äôs insulting to imply I don‚Äôt. The movement is happening- you can still see how social distancing being broken is a concern for people like us who will pay the ultimate price of not seeing shielded relatives.
I‚Äôm so upset I didn‚Äôt response and the other two siblings liked it. I deleted my twitter.
I already feel so lonely in this. I‚Äôve been abused emotionally throughout this by one of my sisters.
It‚Äôs a mess. Friends don‚Äôt want to know. They text at first, offered a zoom chat today and i just wanted a friendly chat and said so, to take my mind off my sadness. No replies when I pushed. They‚Äôre bored of my depressing situation.
I put my baby down on Sunday with my partner and walked out. I was close to walking out in front of a bus. The thought of my baby brought me back round.
I can‚Äôt have these feelings aloud- My OH is amazing and if it wasn‚Äôt for him I wouldn‚Äôt have made it this far. His family don‚Äôt really ask after me or our baby, feels like they‚Äôre only interested in when she‚Äôs older or something. Not in her baby years it‚Äôs pretty irritating. They don‚Äôt ask my OH how he is coping. Now my own siblings who never cared before are actively against me? When all my life I‚Äôve given up a lot, to spend time with them. Now they‚Äôre old enough to be rude they just are with no respect.
I feel very alone. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I will be taking up counselling this time to cope as it‚Äôs not fair on my baby but I know I‚Äôll be left to pick up the pieces. 
I think the fact I‚Äôm so hurt, I feel sick with the pain inside. I‚Äôve lost four pounds this week in weight. 

I don‚Äôt expect any replies. I need to get this off my chest, and just say how sad and frightened and bitter I am

I am hoping she gets out of there. But I‚Äôve little optimism left when I‚Äôve seen how vulgar people who you expect to support you actually are. Just no communication.

During the funeral I was only comforting my mother. She leans heavily on me for support. No one else sat beside her or comforted her. I had to do it alone. He already had children, and their partners, we are close with, whom could have sat around her with me.

This is particularly messed up for me because as I kid I had to take care of her. She was depressed and I was her caregiver.

It kept regrowing, he defeated it and it grew back again.  and this time it spreaded so quick that we are still in shock. It's happening. He started to be really weak and detoriate since xmas and i was not able to care for him at home anymore in terms of physical support, so we admitted him in on sunday. He was still alright, not at his best until wednesday when he complained of massive headaches. He vomitted twice during the night. In the morning, I tried to wake him up for his daily medication, he was only able to open his eyes to see me 1nlast time and went back to deep sleep.  He became unresponsive on thursday, was brought down to ICU. Doctors suspected it was either internal bleeding or the tumour surpressing on the nerve. He registered to be organ donor so they are in process of finalising it and will romove the tubes out on sunday.

I thought I'd prepared for this, and that I wouldnt be too bad but it's really hard to see him with breathing tubes and all other tubes around him. And he doesnt respond to me but he looks so peaceful in his sleep. We talk to him a lot hopong he could hear us. I'm glad that his massive group of friends get to come and say goodbye to him for the last time. 

I'm just really dissapointed that it happened so quick that we didn't have chance to do all the videos he wished to have in his funeral. And at some point on wednesday, I was out to some appointment, his mind wasnt right and did not make alot of senses, he thought that I neglected him and did not need him anymore. I love him so much and I'd never ever leave him. I really hope in his last moment he did not think it that way.... there are so many 'I should have done this or I should have not done that' thought running through in my brain and I just cant ignore those thoughts. We onlg have 1 day left together and I try not to think too much about it and spend quality time with him but it's just hard. Guess I wanna try venting them all in here so I might feel abit better.

Fellow employee was diagnosed with cancer today.

It‚Äôs almost 50% of our check. She never signed up for individual insurance either. Open enrollment here in Illinois just ended few days ago...

She‚Äôs normally a bubbly , go get them person here at work. In the last 72 hours, she‚Äôs given up all hope of life. 2 days ago was an x-ray for a slip and fall. Yesterday evening was a scheduled biopsy. This morning, they called her back in to confirm cancer (she hasn‚Äôt said which one, but from her x-rays it looks to be lung with a growth a little bigger than a golf ball on her lower left lung) She has no family (her husband and son were killed in a accident 10 years ago and parents long deceased) We‚Äôre trying to be there, but she‚Äôs already made her life into a transaction. (I don‚Äôt have the money so I might as well just die. There‚Äôs nothing out there for anyone to help me. I‚Äôm already dead, might as well just work till it‚Äôs over-direct quotes this morning)

We want to show her there‚Äôs hope and this isn‚Äôt the end, but don‚Äôt know where to even begin. You google things and you get ads and half infos. I‚Äôm hoping reaching out to you all here could help try to find that hope. Are there ways to get her on the insurance to get the treatment she needs? Are there resources she can go to? Groups she can lean on for support and hope? 

I‚Äôve never had to deal with anything of this magnitude in my life. I‚Äôm normally good at finding hope in dark places, but even I have a sinking feeling. Anything you all can offer to point her in the right direction is huge. Thank you  all so much.

Update: Adenocarcinoma Stage 3A was her precise diagnosis. We had a long conversation about it and we‚Äôll be keeping her distracted at work to keep her mind busy as much as possible. So far, there‚Äôs some options she‚Äôs been offered but doesn‚Äôt want to take the advise of the doctors. I am working behind the scenes to see if there is anything else that can be done. A doctor friend is reaching out to see what they can suggest since this isn‚Äôt his area of expertise. In our conversations she is lacking hope cuz she has no one. We‚Äôre gonna gently find things and present them to her and told her we have her back",2019-12-20 00:54:38

She has agreed to an aggressive treatment plan and for that I'm incredibly grateful. Mom has always had a sharp tongue and I've always been able to ignore her or talk her down. Ever since her diagnosis she's turned into a viper. I'm her only child and the only one transporting her to her doctor's appointments, chemo, running to get her prescriptions, making sure she has food...you name it. It's all on me because she has driven off every other family member. They don't call her, they call me for updates. They have tried to call her, but she either hangs up on them or won't answer. Her mother called me in tears last night wondering why she won't answer her calls.

I fully recognize she is scared to death and that she's in pain. I know she's frustrated she can't care for herself like she always has, she can't work, she's strapped to an oxygen tank. It's the holidays and she wants to go shopping and she can't. She hate's being constantly poked, prodded and asked the same questions over and over. That her life has changed dramatically. I don't blame her for being upset. It's a perfectly natural response. But she is lashing out at me worse than ever before and she's starting to make a scene at her appointments. And I have calmly asked her to please stop yelling at her care team and me. (And bless them for their patience they have with her.) I have tried to be firm with her and have a rational conversation about her behavior. Today I finally decided to stand my ground and that I was not going to be yelled at any longer. I told her she's going to run off the only person left in her life that cares enough to help. Of course she screamed that I obviously do not care, I am treating her horribly and proceeded to call me a liar...and I can't get over it. She's never screamed at me the way she did today. She's never said such hurtful things to me. And today was the first day I dropped her off for her infusion and left. I asked the nurse to call me when it was close to time so I could pick her up. Now I suspect I'll get yelled at on the way home that I abandoned her. 

Mom was placed on an antidepressant and honestly I'm not sure it's working. The social team is trying to encourage her to consider counseling. She won't. She is criticizing everything I'm trying to do for her. I'm trying not to be overbearing. I even asked her to tell me if she thought I was around too much, because I know there are some days during this process she just wants to be alone. I'm trying to look to see what I can adjust in the way I'm involved in this. I can't just remove myself, and I'm trying to not let the screaming and cursing get to me. 

I have asked her social about caregiver support and she's going to provide some info for me. I'm just at a bit of a loss on how to calm her down and how to steel myself against her nastiness. Or even if that's what I should do. 

\*I feel better just getting this out there. Thanks for listening.",2019-12-10 23:20:26

Unfortunately the tumor they thought was DCIS is actually invasive. Shes doing well, but I worry so much. After her biopsy,  she couldnt lift our kids for 2 days (2, and 11months), and I could see it was breaking her heart not being able to pick them up for hugs. I worry what limitations the treatment will have, and her emotional response.

It was just so rapid, from planning on trying for a third kid, which we wanted, to now being told we would need to save eggs if we wanted to try in the future.

My dad died Friday night,13,9q6ibb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/9q6ibb/my_dad_died_friday_night/,2,1540180031.0,"Almost a month ago my dad, 56, injured himself while at work and seemed to have torn muscles on the left side of his body. He was frustrated about the slow healing and pain and eager to get back to his job.

I thought nothing of it. He was a tank of a man who had injured himself many times over the years, broken his C1 vertebrae in a bike accident, been thrown through a pane glass window by a drunk on a train platform as a cop, and he would be back on his feet soon enough. We exchanged funny Facebook posts 200 km apart, as always, and I went on with my life.

Last week, after going for a follow up about the apparent damage to his body and pain, he suddenly collapsed and was rushed to the closest hospital unable to speak or walk.

Through my mom I learned they suspected it was initially undiagnosed bone cancer. I immediately went to see him and witnessed a drugged up semi-lucid skeleton of the man I had  looked up to as my ever present tower of strength for most of my life. He was in agony, moaning and flailing, and the weary and pained look on his shallow face and sunken cheeks will haunt me for the rest of my life, as well as the shaggy greying beard that I had never seen on his clean shaven face. He looked old, pathetic, sickly. He had a catheter in and was wearing a diaper under his gown, the kind of humiliation he would have been horrified by.

Over the course of a few hours he would fade in and out of awareness, mumbling nonsense and giving me a few scarce moments of clarity. He began sobbing when he saw me, and I could see fear and regret in his eyes.

The attending doctor told me that his kidneys were in danger of failing due to high calcium, and their immediate concern was to control this before running a battery of tests. The confused mental state was part drugs and part a body‚Äôs normal reaction to the problems. I broke down and cried next to him while he rested in a drug induced haze.

I said my goodbye, which thank God was returned with an ‚ÄúI love you too‚Äù and a warm hug with a familiar embrace. Those will be my dad‚Äôs last spoken words to me and I am thankful.

I went back to work the following day and tried to continue on like nothing was wrong, against a slew of second hand information and family bullshit about how everything was going to be fine. My gut told me it wasn‚Äôt going to be okay. I prepared myself for the worst. I was right.

On Friday morning I got the call. All the tests had come back definitively. It was lung cancer that had remained undiagnosed for some time and had spread throughout his body, including the brain. No treatment was possible. It was fatal. He had at most hours or days to live. He was in palliative care. I needed to come and say goodbye.

I left work and waited for my wife to get home. I was in no shape to drive. We drove and hour and a half in dreadful small talk, trying not to talk about what we knew was coming. Fake laughter, music. My dad was dying.

When we got there, I was greeted by an outrageous family reunion. A feuding Aunt who hated my dad, another Aunt I hadn‚Äôt seen for almost 20 years, her family, and my mom. Of course, I thought, all the worms crawl out for this.

My dad was in a state that broke my heart. His eyes unfocused, his body withered and showing bloody rashes all over. Unable to speak or move under his own power. Unable to breathe on his own and hooked up to air. This was a military man who once slashed his hand open while fixing a broken down car on the middle of a freezing highway and merely cursed about it after wrapping a rag around his bloody palm. The man who taught me work ethic, strength, and dedication. That life wasn‚Äôt all flowers and fun, but it wasn‚Äôt as bad as you thought it was. I asked for time alone.

My wife and I sat in the room, the feel of death‚Äôs hand hanging over everything, I felt this lump in my throat. He might have been out of it, I have no way of knowing, but I told him how fucking proud I was to have him as my dad, how much he had steered my life for the better, and how our many fights over the years were forgiven. I told him we‚Äôd be ok. That it was ok to go and I‚Äôd see him again.

We stayed a while longer amidst drama and ‚Äúhere, I want you to have this‚Äù and ‚Äúyou need to do this‚Äù and awkward fake laughter and stories.

I went home that night and found up out he had died an hour after we had left. Part of me thinks he was waiting for me, but who knows.

Now I‚Äôm left with a mother who wasn‚Äôt there for me and a squabbling petty family. Not one phone call to ask how I am, my work friends have shown me more compassion and basic human decency than my blood.

I am thankful he knew my kids. I am thankful I said goodbye. I am enraged by the drama and upset my family is causing. I‚Äôm staying as much in my own world with the people I care about than theirs, I am celebrating the man who made me what I am, and feeling the loss of his steady hand and sarcastic sense of humour.

I look to my own children and prey they will never know the pain I just went through.

I‚Äôm going on with my own life. It‚Äôs what he would have wanted.",2018-10-22 03:47:11

Yesterday, he told me that his white blood cell count has spiked and in the 110 range. He doesnt want to take the medicine anymore as it is causing mouth sores and he has no joy in life. His doctor has told him he only has 2-3 weeks left.

I feel incredibly guilty to grieve my husband's cancer diagnosis,12,ipxzzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/ipxzzu/i_feel_incredibly_guilty_to_grieve_my_husbands/,10,1599747889.0,"My husband was diagnosed with Testicular Cancer in 2014, which was 8 months before we met. He was going through a marriage breakup and he'd just fractured his knee. We built a strong bond and married two years later and attempted to start a family whilst he was being monitored with bloods during remission.

I had a traumatic ectopic pregnancy after falling pregnant on our honeymoon so we attempted IVF, all cycles ended in failure.

After going on a cruise in December to try and get into the right frame of mind for further IVF. My husband was diagnosed with a second Testicular Cancer.

Since then he has been cleared and in remission again, we have sperm frozen but he has to have testosterone treatment for the rest of his life now. He has been through so much adjustment I felt like I had to be strong for him but now I feel like I am not allowed to grieve, that I would be attention seeking because I haven't been the patient. I haven't had 3 surgeries in one year.

How do I feel OK to grieve? To be sad? Why do I feel so alone and unable to talk to anyone about this?",2020-09-10 14:24:49
RIP Grandma.,11,idql9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/idql9p/rip_grandma/,2,1598015242.0,"Cancer is truly an awful disease. It sucks the life right out of its victims, but she fought so hard all the way to the end. This time last year doctors predicted she had 3 months left, and she kicked its ass for a whole year. She got to have one more go around of every holiday, birthday, and anniversary with the family. One more year of treasured memories for us all. 

The past 4 months were gruelling, painful, bedridden, but she was happy to be surrounded by family all the time.

She used to be quiet and reserved, until one day she realized nobody was in charge of her anymore, from then on everything was about having fun with the grandkids. She quit smoking, played beer pong, tried weed, sang, danced, and gave life all she had to offer. Right now it‚Äôs difficult to look back on the fun memories of family vacations, holiday celebrations, crazy superstitious traditions, and to separate them from the painful image of the frail sick woman in bed. But I‚Äôm glad my family got to have as much time as we did.

I can‚Äôt possibly imagine how my grandpa must be feeling. Losing the person you chose to spend your whole life with, losing your best friend in the world. Watching their health deteriorate for a year, never knowing which kiss goodnight will be the last. Heartbreaking. 


I know my family is dealing with all the same pain, and sharing that is bringing us even closer than we already are, but I‚Äôm not really good at public displays of emotion or anything like that. So I just had to vent somewhere.",2020-08-21 13:07:22
THIS IS IT,12,icbg4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/icbg4z/this_is_it/,0,1597819136.0,"Hello good people of reddit! 
I think we can all agree cancer is a vile disease that has taken the lives of too many lovely people out there...
My name is Hailee and I‚Äôm a cancer survivor. March 16, 2021 will mark one decade of remission for me, and I thank the stars every day. 
I‚Äôve come here on recommendation of my boyfriend to tell you a bit about my story...
I was 14 when I was diagnosed with aggressive osteogenic sarcoma, and my life was flipped on its head.
Going through the hardest year of my life, I made a lot of deep realizations about myself and the Illness. I had started writing prose pieces that gave people some insight into my life as a teenage cancer patient, and little tricks I used to get by.
A few years after completing chemotherapy, my mother and I decided to combine our minds to bring a book to you, that we hope can touch the lives of someone in need of it.
You‚Äôll find chapters from both patient and caretaker perspectives, with tips at the end of each segment. Tips for patients, caretakers, and friendly people who aren‚Äôt sure how to lend a hand.
I felt weird about making this post initially because I didn‚Äôt want it to seem like a huge ‚Äúlook at me‚Äù ordeal... I just kind of wish I had something like this when I was going through it . The only reason we made the book was to hopefully help a family who needs it like ours did, and if I don‚Äôt tell people it‚Äôs out there no one will know.
If you are interested in reading more about our story and how we tried to make the impossible possible every day, follow us on social media, or grab a copy for you or someone you care about! 
Thank you for you time and much love!

EDIT: 5% of all proceeds go to The Rainbow Connection,  pretty much the equivalent to make a wish but only centered in Michigan.

My (19F) dad (58M) has been diagnosed with stage 4 oropharyngeal cancer. Just need to talk this one out.,10,i9i49z,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/i9i49z/my_19f_dad_58m_has_been_diagnosed_with_stage_4/,12,1597421852.0,"My family‚Äôs a small but nuclear unit in terms of chaos. My brother (27) and I have absolutely minimal contact with my mother, who is still ‚Äúwith‚Äù (lol) my father, and has my 12 year old sister with her. Mum and I didn‚Äôt speak for four years as she‚Äôs an abusive alcoholic to a Tee. My dad came down with symptoms last July, and got very ill in September. I cut contact with him for three months over other issues, but begged him to see a doctor. When we started talking again he hadn‚Äôt, and it was all worsening and spreading in terms of symptoms. That was December. I had a terrible nightmare of waking up this xmas with him dead and no family there. (I rarely have nightmares and when I do, they‚Äôre always prophetic and true, my family and friends really worry when I say I‚Äôve had a nightmare). 
So I moved back home despite our really rocky relationship at the time, because my gut sensed things were off. 

Skip forward another 6 months of me and my brother begging him to see a doctor. We got told it was probably non Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma end of June. Then by mid July it was oesophageal. Now we know it‚Äôs tonsils, which has spread to lymph nodes, oesophagus and possibly brain/lungs/stomach (waiting for confirmation). One of the tumours somewhere in his neck was 10cm in mid July. I dread to think what it will be by the time the nhs start his treatment.

We‚Äôre still waiting on the final confirmations on everything diagnosis wise, but it really doesn‚Äôt look great. My dads superman, he‚Äôs never smoked a cigarette, touched a drug, he goes years at a time without a drink, and has exercised 2 hours a day every day since he was a teenager. He‚Äôs a world record holding bodybuilder, if there was a real life superman it would be him. He‚Äôs always refused painkillers, begrudges antibiotics and cried about having to have sedation for a double hip replacement. 

And yet, he‚Äôs not even into the woods, and he‚Äôs already the skinniest palest, most lifeless I‚Äôve ever seen him. My brother is his primary caregiver as he works from the family home, whereas I travel for work extensively so I‚Äôm rarely home for more than 2/3 day‚Äôs at a time.  I want to be there as much as I can be, but I also know that my dad has expressly said he wants my brother to be there more, not me, not my mum. I need to respect that too I think.

Anyway, I just really need some words of wisdom, understanding. Anything. All the friends I have who had parents with cancer are parent less by 20. And there‚Äôs a few. I‚Äôm incredibly prepared for that situation, not that you ever really can be. But moreover, I need advice, it‚Äôs the first cancer case in 6+ generations on both sides of the family and the first seriously ill adult in my family in my lifetime. 

How do I keep my dad as ok as I can? I‚Äôve never had to spend a second thinking of cancer in my life, not as it would affect me, and it‚Äôs dawning on me that the path i watched all my friends fall down could be coming my way. I just want to make sure he‚Äôs as comfortable and supported as he can be through this, and I know how he works, but I have no clue what‚Äôs about to be thrown at us.",2020-08-14 16:17:32

There were people from all walks of life, genders, ages and race. And for once.... race didn‚Äôt matter. We were all in one place on common ground. Because we were all bonded by one thing...the fight against Cancer. 

When we talked it was no bad vibes.  You don't feel like anyone thought they were better than the other or because you was white and I was black. When my daughter was at the Benson Center I was on a mental and emotional roller coaster. Daily I met and conversed with many people. Nightly I ate with different families, so you know the food was different everytime lol. But I did learn that eating vegan ain‚Äôt so bad. In every verbal or nonverbal encounter the feeling was always mutual. We knew each other was scared, fearful, tired, cried out with no sense of direction. 

I felt good hugging other mothers and sharing my fears, tears and hugs with them. I opened up on Facebook cancer groups and I learned so much. Because no matter how far fetch it seemed.... somebody somewhere went thru it before me or they read something about it or just a simple word of encouragement.  I just want to let someone know today that we are praying for you. Regardsless to what the bottom line is don‚Äôt give up. Live life to the fullest everyday. If you can't walk or talk... you can laugh. You can think happy thoughts. Choose happiness, laughter and peace. Dont worry about what you can't change and what's done.

I‚Äôm an only child on my moms side. On top of everything, she is also going through a divorce, which started a month after she was diagnosed. Her, hopefully, soon to be ex-husband, is a greedy POS. They signed a prenupt before marriage and yet he‚Äôs fighting it. I have some family in town, but I am basically my mothers sole care giver. On top of caring for her, I work full-time, am a part-time grad student, and have the overwhelming stress of balancing the fact that I don‚Äôt know how much longer we have together (although I am very optimistic, but also a realist) but also the impending stress that would ensue with dealing with assets/will/last requests, etc. 

To be honest, at this point, fuck money. I make a decent pay check but I‚Äôd give it all up every month to get my mom whatever her hearts desire, and I have. I‚Äôd sell everything I own to ease her pain and make the cancer disappear. I just want to know, what am I to expect? Do things get better?

I love my mom but her cancer made her so much more reliant on me and its killing me inside.,11,htadbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/htadbi/i_love_my_mom_but_her_cancer_made_her_so_much/,4,1595074055.0,"Let me start out by saying that I never had a great relationship with my mom. She was always tough on me. My older sister was catered to and this isn't just a point of view, it's a fact that shes admitted and apologized for. It isn't to say she never did things for me but she is not even a polite person, shes likeable and personable but she isn't polite and this last year we both have fought a lot and luckily a lot of mental/emotional healing has happened. 

I'm a female in my mid 20's, my mom was diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer after she already went through surgery and chemo for Stage 2 the year prior. 

I moved away from her when I was 17 and I'd been living alone for 3 years up until last year. Before the chemo she treated me basically like a personal slave, she'd yell at me for not cleaning enough, not helping her with things that I didn't know I had to and for when I set up clear boundaries. I'm expected to be her shauffer because she hates driving and is terrified. 

She has nerve damage from the chemo, my sister causes unnecessary stress and berates my mom so basically any and all care is on me. My mom can barely feel her hands and feet and although the chemo has stopped, it seems that the nerve damage is not improving (she says its worse.) She can't cook because she drops everything, she can't drive even if she wanted to now, she can't open anything, she can't cut her own nails, she can barely even grasp a fork. 

I'm trying to be positive but we live together because someone has to look after her right now. It's like having a toddler, she calls my name upwards of 10 times a day because of course theres chemo brain and she can't remember enough for me to do something for her while I'm right in front of her. 

I feel horrible for complaining because I know I'm lucky and shes lucky shes still here. Shes always been a source of pain for me though and I feel like i might end up being her primary caretaker for the rest of her life, that her nerve damage may never get better, that she will likely get early onset dementia because shes too stubborn to listen to me about exercising her brain. It feels like even if I leave her, i don't know if anyone else will help because she's single and my sister can be so difficult. I feel incredibly selfish, guilty and hopeless. 

As much as I worry about her future, I worry about mine. My life has barely begun and I'm worried that I'm going to get increasingly negative and become someone who never dates again because I am living with my mom and it sounds weird but I am actually doing it because she literally needs me to care for her. The amount of assistance she needs wouldn't qualify for a home care aide either. I think I'm overwhelmed mostly because I've never had children and I haven't had a long term relationship for several years. I just am so used to the independence and now I don't know what life looks like or what I look like to others looking in. 

I'm sorry to vent, if anyone has any kind and positive words right now I'd appreciate it. Thanks for reading this far.

Edit: to clarify she is thought to be cancer free now and we are just waiting for official remission. Her nerve damage and stubbornness is why I feel I may care for her for the rest of her life.",2020-07-18 12:07:35

It has been a huge help and massively reassuring to read the stories of others who have been impacted by this horrible fucking illness.

Last night, after the bravest battle, my beautiful dad passed away. We held him tight and told him how much we all loved him. We had his playlist on shuffle and shortly after he went, Space Oddity by David Bowie played. 

""Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles,  
I'm feeling very still.  
And I think my spaceship knows what I must do,  
And I think my life on Earth is nearly through""

Bowie is one of my favourite artists. The fact this song played was both heartbreaking and heartwarming all at the same time. He told me he wanted me to have a baby a few months ago. We have always said that when we have a child, they shall be called Bowie. It was so strange that this was the first song we heard after he passed. 

He was the best person. I was his first of three daughters and he called me ""number one"". He was my number one too. Our song was ""Suddenly"" by Billy Ocean because it was the first song he heard when I was born. He added the lyrics to the speech he gave at my wedding and we danced to it on my 30th birthday.

I am going to miss him beyond measure.

I apologise for rambling, I just needed to vent.

She had as much of the chemo treatments as her body allowed but on checkup, they found it had spread AT LEAST through the bladder wall.  A few weeks ago she had her bladder removed and they took a piece of lung tissue to be biopsied as they thought it may have spread.  It came back positive, so now it is stage 4. BUT then this past week, she went back to the hospital due to a blockage in the small intestine which ended up requiring another small surgery. Now, she has not been in contact for a couple of days, or online at all. I am currently unable to call to check up on her as I am having my phone replaced. She is home, amid a plague of sorts with her husband Tom who also may have cancer and if either of them gets this virus both of them are likely dead. 

I guess I just needed to tell someone because the likelihood that I will never see my mom again has hit me hard and I am finding it very difficult in combination with the mental illness I already deal with that is making it so so so much worse.  I hope I do not sound like I am whining about stuff or overreacting.......

UPDATE: So I am sorry for not replying to anyone, I have just been trying to function. My mom messaged me on FB Messenger and had been ill for a couple of days after the surgery for her blockage.

He's gone,12,ffvwvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/ffvwvb/hes_gone/,12,1583794749.0,"In October of 2019 around my dad's 69th birthday he was diagnosed with kidney cancer (same type that took his father).  He had his first immunotherapy treatment in february and it went well, he said he was tired but feeling good.  Dad was newly retired and said beating this cancer was his new job and he was going to devote his time to fighting it.  Dad's second treatment last week didn't go so well, he had went into anaphylactic shock and needed intervention.  He called and we talked about it, he was still upbeat and had a positive outlook, that was the 5th of March.  On Friday he texted that he was in the hospital for a short stay bc the treatment ""threw an important blood hormone and is affecting my heart"", i messaged him on Saturday to check in and see how he was, he was good he said, i told him i loved him.  There was no response to my message on Sunday and now this morning he is gone.",2020-03-09 22:59:09
My grandmother dies this morning...,11,fdg174,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/fdg174/my_grandmother_dies_this_morning/,7,1583370272.0,"I‚Äôm Swedish but live in England. The reason for that is love, like a lot of times. Anyways, my family has always only been my mum, grandmother and my two uncles. Back in 2015 me, my fianc√© and son moved to England together after living in Sweden for 3 years. Back then my mum and my uncles had started to fall out with each other, it wasn‚Äôt that bad back then but ever since it has gotten worse and worse. I have always talked to my mum daily during all the years, and I have tried to call once in a blue moon to my uncles and grandmother as well. Sending cards etc just to let them know that I do care about them, miss them and love them all. They have never really tried to put an effort to talk to me though. The thing is that my mums and her brothers problems put me in the middle, but no one seemed to care. They just kept fighting (without even talking to each other) 

Today I found out by my mum that my grandmother passed away. She found out by a family friend, and that friend found out from my uncles. I was last in the line...and I feel so upset about it. Apparently she has been in hospice care since two months back, and they didn‚Äôt even let me know that. If they did I would have hd the chance to take my son, fly over, and see her for a last time. 

Imm sorry, this is just a bunch of rambling from my side. No idea if you‚Äôll even understand what the heck I try to say. But needless to say I feel better getting it out. Thank you for listening, whoever you might be. ‚ù§Ô∏è",2020-03-05 01:04:32
How to stay strong when you‚Äôre an emotional mess?,10,f57vbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/f57vbe/how_to_stay_strong_when_youre_an_emotional_mess/,13,1581970269.0,"Like everyone here, I wish I didn‚Äôt have to be here, but sadly here I am.

I received the devastating news today that my Mum has a tumour on her kidney and also a pathological pelvic fracture as there is a lesion in the bone. Not sure if the 2 are related or 2 separate things. 

Mum and I shed many tears as I read through the results, and after she and my Dad left, I just sobbed uncontrollably to the point where I almost threw up. I‚Äôm a mess. 

It hurts my heart. My Mum is the greatest woman I know. To know that this is happening to her just destroys me. I‚Äôm torn between not wanting to wish precious time away but also wanting to know where we‚Äôre at - is this treatable? Can this be fixed? I‚Äôve been googling which is the worst thing I can do and also useless because depending on the stage, the prognosis differs greatly. 

My partner has been great. He asked me earlier what I needed - do I need time alone? Do I want him to sit with me? I was just ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know what I need‚Äô. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I just feel so helpless and useless. I feel like I need to be doing *something*, I just don‚Äôt know what. 

I know I need to pull myself together and be strong for my Mum (& my Dad who is really devastated by the news), just like she has been for my whole life. I flit between ‚Äòit will all be fine‚Äô to ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt know that it will all be fine‚Äô. My emotions are all over the place. I just need advice from people who have been there: how do I remain strong? How do I put on a brave face? How does life continue as normal - how do I go to work tomorrow and act like everything‚Äôs fine when my whole world has been turned upside down? I do feel that being around my workmates will help because work is like therapy sometimes, and if I stayed at home I‚Äôd just sit here and torture myself with the what ifs.

I just keep hoping I will wake up and this will have all been a bad dream. I feel absolutely burnt out by the shock and sadness. I wish I could fix it. I wish I could go through it for her.",2020-02-17 20:11:09

It‚Äôs great news. However, over the past two years he has completely deteriorated in terms of his mobility and outlook. He has lost tons of weight and will only eat a meal a day and drink a bottle of wine. He has neuropathy in his hands and feet and it has really affected him for the worse. He won‚Äôt follow through with the recommendations of his doctor to exercise and eat small meals a day.

He used to be vibrant and boisterous and now he is bitter, frail, and extremely focused on himself.

Don‚Äôt want to do this...I feel like a terrible daughter (massive rant),11,e3u9ru,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/e3u9ru/dont_want_to_do_thisi_feel_like_a_terrible/,16,1575137871.0,"This is going to be a long one and I just want to ask people not to judge me too harshly for what I‚Äôm going to say, as I‚Äôm already beating myself up mercilessly over it. Just wanted some reassurance or something because I feel like I can‚Äôt relate to most of the posts on here and I was wondering if anyone else has felt the same way or if I‚Äôm just a shitty human being. 

My dad was recently diagnosed with Glioblastoma (both the most common and most fatal type of brain tumour). He‚Äôs had surgery and is starting radiotherapy and chemo soon but they‚Äôve been told that only 15% of people with this tumour live past a year, even with treatment. 

I have a very complicated relationship with my parents and as they caused me a fair bit of trauma in my childhood. They are nicer people now but I still have a lot of unexpressed anger towards them which makes our dynamic uncomfortable at the best of times. I feel distant from them emotionally and like we don‚Äôt have a strong bond. 

I live with my husband a few hundred miles away from the rest of my family. Dad has my mum and stepsister around, but I‚Äôm his only biological child. I feel like I‚Äôm expected to be there way more, do more, say more - but I don‚Äôt think I can. If/when he needs lots of care or is dying, not only do I not think I can cope with being there and helping, but I actively don‚Äôt want to. Obviously I am scared for my dad and don‚Äôt want him to suffer, but the emotional labour of this situation feels totally beyond me and I don‚Äôt want to suffer with him either. 

I‚Äôm worried it would leave my mental health even more broken that it already is (has been quite fragile for years and I‚Äôm only just looking at starting treatment for the BPD and trauma caused by my childhood). Because I‚Äôve had so many years of either being suicidal or just trying to self-destruct, my instinct with anything now is to put my own well-being and my husband first, start recovering, and make sure I‚Äôm not doing any further damage to my psyche. I don‚Äôt want to do any of the stuff that‚Äôs expected of me and I‚Äôm shit scared of the whole thing. 

I feel like every single cancer/illness narrative says the person who doesn‚Äôt feel able to be around as much is horrible and selfish. The good people are the ones who sacrifice themselves and spend most of their time looking after their parent‚Äôs needs. I used to work in social care and when discussing seriously ill older people their children were always demonised and talked badly about for not becoming their carer, or not being close by at all times. I knew that it wouldn‚Äôt be that simple where my family were concerned but I didn‚Äôt expect to have to deal with it this soon. I always thought it‚Äôd happen when I was older and more competent and functioning well enough to meet my obligations. I‚Äôm 27 and my life is a mess. 

I feel fucking evil and selfish and so angry with myself for having these thoughts and feelings. I wish I could do what society and my family expect of me, but from reading about how this horrid disease develops...I don‚Äôt think I can without destroying my sanity or my life. And I don‚Äôt want to do that anymore. I fully intend to do as much as I can - but I fear that‚Äôs not a lot. 

I don‚Äôt even have a therapist I can vent this to. The only person who understands how I feel is my husband, but he also hasn‚Äôt had a family member be this ill. I feel completely and utterly alone and most other stories I‚Äôve seen fail to comfort me because I can‚Äôt relate to the wholesome,  straightforward relationships other people have with their parents, and the complete selfless dedication they show. I feel actively alienated by it. I don‚Äôt even want to go home for Christmas (even though it could conceivably be my dad‚Äôs last) because it‚Äôs so painful - I‚Äôd rather stay with my in laws and be surrounded by laughter and love and not have to face any of this. 

Someone please make me feel like I‚Äôm not crazy or horrible because I‚Äôm emotionally flagellating myself atm and can‚Äôt get past it. I‚Äôve convinced myself I‚Äôm a selfish piece of shit who doesn‚Äôt deserve any kind of family. Is keeping my distance a little bit even an option here? 

Please nobody be mean or judgy. I feel very fragile and just need help. X",2019-11-30 18:17:51

The doctors keep releasing us because it's just diarrhea and they can get her back on track in the hospital.  But as soon as we're out she's back to not eating.

Anyway. My mom (59) was diagnosed with cancer for the third time back in July of 2018. It has been a roller coaster and very obvious this was going to be it. 
When she was first diagnosed, she didn‚Äôt tell me right away. I(22 f) just got engaged at the end of May and she didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äútake away the happiness‚Äù. At first I was upset but after some time I understood what she could of possibly meant. I then began to realize that this time was aggressive and wasn‚Äôt going to be easy. We planned our wedding for September 21st 2019. She had been a part of the planning and was so so so excited for the big day. 
Last Friday, she went to the hospital because she was having pain and a lot of bloating. They found out her cancer has spread completely taking over the Liver. They then talked about the options with her. Skip forward to Monday, she was still in the hospital. I came up to see her but she was sleeping. I gently woke her up and told her I just came by after work to check on her and I would let her sleep. She told me that she loved me and definitely needed the sleep. I could just tell a difference in her, I began to tear up and said ‚ÄúI love you too, I‚Äôll see you tomorrow‚Äù. That‚Äôs when she promised me not to cry because she will be at the wedding and everything was going to be okay. I promised-definitely didn‚Äôt keep it. 
The next day my dad called me as I was on my way home from work telling me that the doctor just called and that they took a liter of fluid off her lungs but she has made zero improvements and they think it‚Äôs best to stop radiation and just make her comfortable and think about hospice. I went straight to the hospital and it was like a completely different person. She was completely out of it, I would talk to her and she wouldn‚Äôt even notice me there. I told her I was going to go home and that I loved her and she softly said ‚ÄúI love you too‚Äù 
Today, she is gasping and struggling to breathe, so I know it‚Äôs not going to be much longer. But I can not calm myself down. It just does not make sense on why it would happen now when I need her the most. We (My fianc√© and I) just bought a house and she was just so excited to get out and come see it.

He was diagnosed a week after thanksgiving last year. Mets to his liver and lungs. He did chemo for a few months then stopped getting treatment. He went into home hospice in July. He died at home with his 7 kids and my mom. 

I don‚Äôt really know why I‚Äôm posting this. I guess I just need people to know about him. He was the best man I‚Äôve ever known. I can‚Äôt think of a single time in my life when he raised his voice. He raised his kids with respect and love. His favorite thing in the world was to spend time with us, and everything he did in his life was to provide a better life for us. He took us on adventures and taught us about history and art and music and science fiction. He read to us before bed- the hobbit was his favorite book. He read lord of the rings, red wall, Harry Potter. He told us stories of when he was a popcorn boy in the circus and his best friend there Bessie the elephant.

When we were in trouble we could call him any time day or night, and he would come without a second thought. He always had the right thing to say and do to help us. He didn‚Äôt do the work for us, but he walked us through finding our paths. 

He adored his 8 grandkids and doted on them. He bought Christmas gifts for our dogs. He welcomed our friends and SOs with open arms and always made them feel comfortable. 

He and my mom had the kind of love that you don‚Äôt think actually exists until you see it. Complete and utter devotion no matter what happened. 

One of the last things he said to me was to be one of the good guys. That hit hard. I realized that he wanted me to continue on the way he loved. He was always one of the good guys. I was his youngest daughter. I took him for granted. I thought he would always be there and now I know that he won‚Äôt be. But the things he taught me will never leave.

Be kind to anyone and everyone. Be generous. Be compassionate. Never judge people. Always see the good in people first. If you make a mistake, own it and learn from it. Never forget your roots or your family. Live life without regret.

My fathers name was Bill. And if you are lucky enough to have known him, your life is forever special for it.

She's always been healthy and responsible for her whole life.  She was due to retire this June and should be loving life right now.  I feel like she's been robbed of what she deserved and it all feels so brutally unfair.  I feel like I'm already mourning while she's still with us.

They‚Äôre refusing to treat her now here too, which is understandable. 

She stopped eating 2 weeks ago and she can never find a way to feel comfortable. She woke up from a nap right now and I noticed a new lymph node popped up. The cancer is advancing so fast.

Just need to talk...,11,gv40e4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/gv40e4/just_need_to_talk/,11,1591118239.0,"Hello everyone,

My mother was diagnosed with lung cancer about 2 years ago. They first said it was diagnosed at an early stage, that she was lucky. She got surgery and removed a part of her lung + radiation and chimo.
It was hard for her but she recovered and could have a normal life for about a year. Unfortunately she started to feel pain in her legs, the cancer was back and had metastasized to her brain and the spinal cord. I knew then that it was serious and her life was threatened but I still believed she could recover because she never told us what type of cancer she had, just that she had to do chimo again and that it was the only way. She did it, I saw her suffer like I never saw anyone suffer and when it's your mother, it's the worst experience of a lifetime. I stood by her and I had hope. A few months later she did her exams and they were positive, no more cancer, we were happy but she wasn't, she said it could come back (I believe she knew things we didn't), I tried to cheer her up.
But she was still very tired, she had nausea and felt weak. We thought it was the chimo? She said she was OK and that we shouldn't worry too much. But it became worse everyday... We never thought it could be cancer because 3 weaks earlier her results were good!
Then a Monday morning, she doesn't answer my texts, I call her she is crying and suffering like hell, the doctor is on the way. I went to her home, she couldn't move and she couldn't stop vomiting, the ambulance came and she went to the hospital, I couldn't go with her because of freaking covid...
2 days later the results of her exams are in, she still has cancer, and it's still on her brain.
Everything collapsed, we were devasted... I could talk to her on the phone and she told me she would fight but I've already noticed she had changed, she said things with no sense, I knew it was because of the tumor. 
Unfortunately the doctors told us it wouldn't work, that there was nothing to do... When I could finally visit her at the hospital, she wasn't really conscious, she could see us but we could see she wasn't herself completely. She was suffering again and again, they let her suffer at least 4 days before giving her more morphine.
Later she was transferred to a specific facility for people at the end of life (I don't know if it's correct, English isn't my first language).
She is still there now, we don't know if she's conscious, sometimes she answers and speak with us even if it doesn't really makes sense, sometimes she smiles and laughs with us, I wish she doesn't realizes where she is, I think she is between reality and her dreams, I hope she finds peace but my world is crushed forever, she is my mother, my best friend...

We believe she knew that her cancer would come back and that she didn't have a lot of time left, she just didn't want us to worry.

It's hard to understand how it can be gone but be back just a few weeks later.

I am devastated, I try to stay strong but it's so hard...

Thank you for reading me, I just wanted to talk to people who can understand what we're going through and maybe give me some advice for the future...

Thank you",2020-06-02 17:17:19

It happened..,11,enfh5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/enfh5l/it_happened/,8,1578815198.0,"So I posted awhile back in here just to get my mind off of things and well, today it happened. My mom passed away. The last few days have been pretty awful as she declined rather quickly. Last night I had my friend, boyfriend, niece and her husband surrounded by her just waiting and wondering what would happen. The noises she made are something I won't forget. The pain she was in must have been awful and it hurt so much to see her that way.   
Around 3AM my friend, niece and her husband left. We didn't know exactly what would happen and so we needed rest. We had heard in the state she was in could last up to 24-48 hours. I fell asleep and my boyfriend stayed by her side. This is what hurts the most because while he tried to wake me up multiple times, I groaned and said, ""I'm too tired"" ""One minute.""  
Around 7AM he came up and told me I needed to come downstairs. He went back down after I said I will in a minute, yet again. When he came back up he had told me he thought she had passed and I immediately shot up and called my friend. The moment walking downstairs and seeing her so still is just heartbreaking. My friend and niece rushed over and it was all a blur. I called so many people and my body felt numb.   
Before they took her away I said a few things to her because like my usual self, I was too much of a coward to say anything to her while she was still here. I did pray before I fell asleep, when she was still here.  
Knowing that I'll never see her or talk to her again hurts me. What hurts me the most is the fact that I regret these years of how we treated each other. I wish I had been a better daughter to her and made her loved like I knew she wanted to. Yet I let the past and my anger towards her leave me unable too. I did love and care for my mom. I just didn't show it to her in the way I should have. I tried my best to take care of her in the last few weeks, yet I wish I did more.   
The feelings come in waves. Sometimes I feel like I got this and other times I just break down. I have my family around to support me, but sometimes I feel so alone. I just wish this was a dream because it doesn't feel real at all.",2020-01-12 07:46:38

It was also the day after we found out he has stage 4 prostate cancer. This was the start to the hardest best two years of my life. He has surgery, radiation, and even chemo since at 55 his progression was very fast so his best chance of remission was aggression. My wife is a very emotional person so I did a lot of comforting her during this time. In addition to all this my older sister is hospitalized with a bowel obstruction. This wasn't that crazy because she has had severe ulcerative colitis her whole life. The week before Thanksgiving she has surgery to remove the section of colon causing the issue. Initially there was no extra concern because it appeared to be a normal albeit severe part of her disease. But the doctors did their due diligence in testing and we found out the day after Christmas they found a tumor inside the section of colon they removed. Further testing showed it didn't originate from where they thought, but has moved there from the ovaries. This was extra hard with both my wife and I now having family members sick in addition to planning our wedding. My father in law finished his chemo in time to not only walk my wife down the aisle, but he also had his hair. My sister was too weak/sick from her treatments to make it there physically but one of my aunts had her there via Skype. Two months and four days later the cancer won. She was so strong and her last few months the doctors said there was no medical reason she was alive, but she kept fighting. I'm thankful that she isn't hurting anymore but it hurts that she's gone.

He even wanted to fly down and see her and she told him not to contact her! they aren‚Äôt talking currently, they haven‚Äôt for nearly a month.

       I talked to her about it twice, because she was upset at dad. She said she thinks dad is ‚Äòready for her to die‚Äô. she said ‚Äòhow can you be sure I‚Äôm dying when I‚Äôve only had one treatment‚Äô and was yelling and crying.

He became really sick and malnourished so we took him to ER again and they performed a CAT Scan. They found a Mass.

Biopsy of the Mass diagnosed it as Stage 4 Cancer and now he's been in the hospital since then. 

He had a cardiac arrest which lead to him being put on life support but they carried on with doing radiation to treat the mass and shrink it

I couldn‚Äôt stay the night at our house tonight (I am part-time dog sitter and currently house-sitting) but I have plans already for us tomorrow to keep him busy (dog walk, lunch, escape room). 

What do I do? Where do I even begin to support him and his family?

Any books, links, videos would be greatly appreciated.",2019-09-08 12:05:22
Struggling with How to Approach Next Steps (Mom),9,jjuiaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/jjuiaj/struggling_with_how_to_approach_next_steps_mom/,2,1603942026.0," Hi everyone,

My mom is 64 and was just diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer, which has metastasized to her brain. It's been a bit of a shock - my parents have been going through a lengthy, nasty divorce and I think my mom had been chalking up most of her symptoms to stress and anxiety from that (shortness of breath, diarrhea, fatigue, loss of appetite/weight loss). In the last three or four weeks, however, her health has declined rapidly (starting with pain in her chest and having a hard time breathing) and a visit to the ER led to a CAT scan of her brain which has confirmed multiple lesions there. She also has spots in her breast and lung(s). While we are waiting to learn ""what kind"" of cancer she has, everything I have read here points to lung cancer. She was a lifetime smoker, just quit within the last 6 month so that's... a cruel irony. Because of COVID, she can't even get in to see an oncologist until the 5th and I am worried about what that wait will mean given the rapid decline she's already seen. 

I knew it was bad when I went to visit her last Monday. I could see it in her. She is a shadow of her former self. It was really heartbreaking. She's done a lot to try to cover up just how bad things were. Trying to ""protect us kids."" And now that my dad has moved across the country post-divorce, it leaves my sister and I to figure out how to help my mom through this. My sister is in denial, I think, and is approaching this with a ""she can still beat this"" mentality. I have an 18 month old at home (who goes to daycare), a full time job, and live 90 minutes away. My mom is in the process of selling the family house (again, divorce) and just signed a lease on an apartment two weeks ago... a second floor apartment. In the last week and a half she has lost the use of one of her legs and is having bouts of temporary blindness in one eye.

I don't know how to do this. What role I should play. Where my mom should go. How much I need to step in. How long she can/should live on her own. If we should try to cancel the lease on the apartment. If we should try to stall the sale of the house. When/how to approach hospice. If I should go to her doctor appointments. If I should ask to be made a health proxy. When I should ask my mom to detail out her last wishes. It's... it's a lot. I know that you all know this. 

I know the person who did her CAT scan said something like ""They are doing amazing things these days. You might get another 1-2 years!"" And I'd like to believe that, but I know deep in my gut that this is going to move fast. 

Any insight you all can provide would be most appreciated. 

I am not a naturally ""warm and fuzzy"" person. I am not good with death (I mean, who is?). But it's been a really tough year (including the divorce and the unexpected death of my nephew) and I just want to try to do right by mom here at the end, even if none of this comes naturally to me. I'm only going to get to do this once, you know?

Thanks for listening.",2020-10-29 03:27:06

I was in college at the time and my parents thought it was best to finish my last two weeks before coming back. I came home to a skeleton looking father that still visually haunts me today. 

Fast forward to about 2 years ago, my mom went in for her first routine colonoscopy with no symptoms. They found a tumor about the size size of a softball. It was removed and went through 12 rounds of chemo. She was in remission for 2 1/2 months until last week when they found some lovely dark spots on her ovaries. They thought it was completely unrelated to the colon cancer and very certain that it was a unique instance and most likely benign, especially since all her diagnostic test comeback clean. Today was her hysterectomy surgery (just as an extra precaution), only to find that her colon cancer has relapsed.

I‚Äôm 33 and I don‚Äôt know how to be there for her this time. Its not the idea of her dying that makes me incredibly sad, it‚Äôs knowing how emotionally distraught, angry, and terrified she must be feeling right now. She is one of the healthiest adults I know. She walks daily, she has never smoked, I can only think of two instances at weddings that I‚Äôve seen her have a drink, and she eats like a rabbit. 

I don‚Äôt know if I can be that strong/positive supportive family member this time and already angry at myself for being very pessimistic about  the outcome. I‚Äôm also so selfishly terrified now that it‚Äôs only a matter of time before I join the chemo club (I‚Äôm having my first dermatologist appointment this Friday to remove a ‚Äúvery minor‚Äù case of skin cancer - I hope the doctors are right this time)

I'm worried. I won't lie about that. But he beat this before. His oncologist says that in cases like his, they typically see improvement. And in a worst case scenario, I'm ready to give him a lobe of lung just like I was willing to give him a kidney.

The procedure only lasted 10 minutes.. we were told they had to stop because a mass was found near his rectum and while we need to wait for the biopsy to confirm, the GI doctor would be ‚Äúshocked‚Äù for it to not be cancerous. 

My heart is broken. After a few hours at home, the GI doctor already had an appointment for my father to see an oncologist on Friday and an MRI that afternoon. It felt like an absolute whirlwind. Like we didn‚Äôt even have time to really process.

So today I sent this message to my sister and brother-in-law (in a simple group SMS thread):

> I frequently want to reach out, but don't have anything useful to reach out *with*... and in true **<family_name_redacted>** fashion, I don't want to impose (\*gasp\* smalltalk!) on anyone.

He went through chemo and radiation and responded well. We thought all was going well, his tumor was gone, he didnt need to have surgery and he still had his voice. Anyway, he goes in for a scan to offically confirm it's completely gone, to find out a new spot showed up on the scan. He has a new tumor at the end of esophagus. A biospy confirms its cancer, secondary primary. Its more serious this time. 

I live a bit away from my family, and this weekend went to visit, today was the first time seeing my dad since the new diagnoses. I get a chance to talk to my dad alone. He is very irritable and even kind of mean, Im trying to understand but I'm hurting too. We get into deeper conversation, and I asked if the doctors have given him a time frame, he tells me no right away. I knew deep down he was lying so I asked if he was, he said he was. He didnt want to tell me, my sister is getting married in 3 weeks and he didnt want any of his daughters to know...at least until after the wedding to not take away from her big day. But he tells me the doctor gave him 6 months-2 years to live...2 years if he is lucky and responds to chemo.

Thankfully he is going to go for treatment...he claims his surgeon believes it is curable. Not sure if I believe that if he was given up to 2 years to live. I make a promise to him not to tell my sisters. I'm spending time with them (I dont see them very much) and I'm watching them have a good time and enjoy themselves while all I can think of is my dad's 'timeline'.

But looking forward, I'm so scared. He'll be on hormone therapy to keep the cancer suppressed in the prostate for the rest of his life, but we have no idea how long it will be an effective for. One day, whether it be in twenty years or two months, the cancer will spread again and it will kill him. Every three months he'll have to have check ups to see if it's spread again. 

And this is what it will be like for the rest of his life, for him and me and the family. A three month cycle of rising anxiety, incredible relief, and then the anxiety will creep in again that the next appointment will be the one that gives us the bad news.

I picked him up from Cancer Care, he gets in the car and tells me he has mantle cell lymphoma, only 10 people per year are diagnosed with it in our province. It is incurable and he has 5 years tops, and he'll be starting chemo next week, but all they can hope for is remission but it'll just keep coming back and be harder to treat. So he's crying, I'm crying, he's talking like he's getting his affairs in order, like he could go at any time.

We get home, wait for my mom and sister to get there, so we can hear the recording of what the Dr said (because my mom asked him to do that) and at no time did she ever say he had 5 years tops. She did say it was incurable, and the goal is remission, and it does get harder to treat every time it comes back, but she also said the treatment is more successful these days than it used to be. You used to see patients living 5-7 years, and now it's more like 7-10 years.

She also said the average patient with this type of cancer is 70 years old, and because he's 58 and his heart is strong, they can go a more aggressive route with the chemo, and with that along with maintenance including stem cell transplant, he could possibly be in remission for 10 years.

Even after that, he's googling mantle cell lymphoma, and on American sites it says only 5-10% of patients live to 10+ years with it. But we're in Canada, people tend to go get checkups more often, and the treatment could be different, and that's including all the older patients, and those sites could be outdated. He just keeps seeking out worst case scenarios.

For those who haven‚Äôt seen my last few posts about my mom, she recently passed away (almost 2 months ago) with stage 4 cancer.
She was only diagnosed a month before her death and never received treatment as it was extremely aggressive and fast growing.
It‚Äôs much easier to read my last post, but in sum:
My mom was in the hospital for a month and finally came home 5 days before her passing, as the doctor finally decided she should get to spend her last memories with us at home. About a week before coming home, she became confused and started hallucinating almost always. She was paranoid and kept seeing things that weren‚Äôt there.
I feel awful about everything. I miss her so much I can‚Äôt describe it. Lately I‚Äôve been having sudden flashes of her when she was sick, and dreams about her being sick almost everyday. Usually in my dreams, I‚Äôm able to tell she‚Äôs sick and know never to say anything hurtful to her, the way I used to before knowing she was sick. I wasn‚Äôt a good daughter to her and I never got to say a proper goodbye. I called 911 thinking they could save her and I‚Äôd meet her again at the ER, but once I got to the ER she was gone. I didn‚Äôt even get to say I love you to her. I left her alone the morning she passed because I was in the middle of doing laundry, even though she asked me to stay. I‚Äôm sobbing as I write this. I keep trying to avoid thinking about it at all and suppress the flashes but recently it‚Äôs getting stronger and longer, making it harder to push away. I do therapy but it‚Äôs hard for me to even talk about it. I willingly started but a part of me just can‚Äôt touch on the subject enough to heal. I have so many regrets and constantly wish it was me, or that I could somehow see or speak to her. I‚Äôm having an undescribable amount of trouble coping with the fact that she‚Äôs gone. My therapist tells me it‚Äôs not my fault but it‚Äôs much easier said than to really believe it. Consequently I‚Äôve been distant from my sister and my dad which I think upsets them a lot, but I honestly don‚Äôt want to be with them right now. I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll feel ok being with them but it‚Äôs not now, so living with my dad has been pretty tough.
I‚Äôm struggling keeping up with school because I‚Äôve lost so much motivation. My original major is close to pre-med so I‚Äôve been thinking about switching ever since my mom‚Äôs diagnosis and seeing the way her doctors wronged her. But I‚Äôm a sophomore now and I feel like starting pre-med now is too late.
Sorry this post became like a rant halfway through. I feel best posting on here about what I‚Äôm feeling because it‚Äôs anonymous and everyone‚Äôs been so kind and most importantly, relatable. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel so depressed but I don‚Äôt want to talk to my therapist or anyone else about it.",2020-09-24 11:56:06

As she's in pallitative care we're allowed to visit her, but if feels like too little too late now. I went to see her yesterday and she cant speak, but kind of grunts and slightly opens her eyes so I'm hoping she knows we're there. 

I'm going to visit every day until she passes, even if she doesnt know I'm there I know if it was me I wouldn't want to be alone.

How do I even prepare to say goodbye- should I even say anything? When I visited her yesterday I just talked about memories, joked about moments in the past and said I loved her.

We made the decision to put him on hospice on Thursday (5 days ago) and he was finally given the pain meds he‚Äôs been waiting for. He slept almost all day Friday and Saturday. Sunday was Father‚Äôs Day and he ate bbq with my aunt and grandma and was still his happy and normal self. That evening we moved him into his hospital bed that was set up in the living room, about 20 steps from the bed he was in. He could not stand up on his own or lift his foot up to take a step. It took a lot of work but we got him into the new bed Sunday. 

Since then he has become completely different. He is not allowing my sister and I to help him or clean him the way we have been for months. And since he‚Äôs been so out of it he‚Äôs starting to refuse his meds in an attempt to be more lucid and less confused. He is not accepting what‚Äôs happening and he‚Äôs fighting death. 

The last 3 days have been very hard. He will not allow us to change his bed linens, can‚Äôt remember where his table or urinal is, and is saying random things that make absolutely no sense. The worst part is he no longer trusts my sister and I. He is being mean and insulting. He thinks we are conning him or trying to intentionally OD him. I know it‚Äôs the meds and it‚Äôs not him and I am not taking it personally but I do not know what to do to calm him down. 

He is refusing his anxiety meds and when I talk to him in a calm quiet voice he says it doesn‚Äôt sound like me and he is embarrassed. When I talk confidently he thinks I am bossing him around.

He starts chemo on Friday. I know that's a good sign because they wouldn't offer it unless they thought it would help.

A year ago, my(f27) dad(m51) was diagnosed with a really aggressive form of kidney cancer. Its been such a wild ride for everyone in our family. 
Its in the end stages. He has lived seven months longer than the average person with the kind he has (what I have been told by his doctor at least.) Which gives me both hope and a sense of dread. This is my first time dealing with cancer at such a close level. 
This man is not my biological dad but he has loved me like his blood since he first started seeing my mom when I was a toddler. 
He's taught me so many things, we've spent so many years gaming, cracking jokes, and rescuing animals together. 
I find myself angry that hes sick. Not at him but seeing what this is doing to him. I've seen him cry more in this last year than I have my entire life and it breaks me how badly this makes him feel when I can do nothing. 
The treatment he was on stopped working and there are so many new tumors. Its so aggressive and the next rounds of chemo are going to destroy him. I'm trying so hard to hold myself together but it hurts so much. 
I have my mom, my brother, his fiance, and my dad. That's my family and i don't want to lose the dad that loves me. It doesn't feel fair. At all.

However, if the cancer grows or spreads more than the doctors deem reasonable, we will have to try clinical trails (most of which are out of state either Texas or DC) but even going forward with that there is only about a 10% success rate. Her doctor even thought that taking a break from all treatment was a reasonable option, which is something we didn‚Äôt want to hear, but she thought that since my mom was feeling really well, that we should take advantage of this time. 

The last two years have been a whirlwind of emotions. My family and I knew that her outcome wasn‚Äôt good, but we‚Äôve always tried to have faith and keep optimistic. But damn this is hard. The truth hurts and hope is slipping through our fingers.

Anyways, We just got out her appointment and I needed to vent. I‚Äôm dreading calling my dad. It‚Äôs going to tear him apart..",2020-02-01 04:44:39

She started chemotherapy right before Christmas and it did more harm than good. It almost took her life and she ended up in the Emergency Room with sepsis.

Now, she‚Äôs been in a rehab nursing facility for almost a month and I don‚Äôt know what will happen. I‚Äôm her only daughter and I live over 6 hours away by car. I‚Äôve been visiting her every weekend and sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm not doing enough. My heart aches to see her in so much pain. Some days are good, but some days are bad because her immune system is so weak. Lately, she‚Äôs been feeling depressed and hopeless. I don‚Äôt want her to feel that way, but sometimes I feel that way too and I don‚Äôt want her to give up :( Her illness really impacts my emotions and I feel so overwhelmed. I have to deal with figuring out her doctors appointments, insurance coverage, bills, etc. It‚Äôs a lot on my mind and I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm handling this well.

On the other hand, I don‚Äôt think my dad is handling this well either. He‚Äôs been by her side everyday, but when he comes home, he doesn‚Äôt even know how to do his own laundry because my mom has always done it for him.

Somebody Wake me up Please,8,etntwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/etntwh/somebody_wake_me_up_please/,11,1579966374.0,"Cancer is nothing like what you see on Tv. Death on television is always portrayed with a bit of foreshadowing. You get this gut feeling that something is going to happen to your favorite character.

Lost my uncle to sarcoma today. He was 44.,8,eph1hq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/eph1hq/lost_my_uncle_to_sarcoma_today_he_was_44/,2,1579195428.0,"I recently moved to California from Oregon to attend medical school last year. I was looking forward to traveling home for Thanksgiving since I could have a chance to relax and enjoy time with my family. That was ruined the day I got home when my dad sat me down and told me my uncle was in the hospital with a brain met. 

He was initially diagnosed and treated with surgery and radiation in fall 2017. The initial lesion was high grade, but superficial. Given his excellent health, we were all pretty optimistic that he would survive. 

He had known about his metastatic disease since February 2019. I guess with his first restaging scan there were suspicious spots in his lungs that grew much more when he was re-scanned a second time. Given the questionable benefit from tradiational chemo (doxorubicin), he was uninterested in therapy. He saw a few specialist centers but they didn't have anything to offer him. He hid this from everyone but my aunt, and no one even knew that he was sick until my dad was called into the hospital after a seizure. 

I saw him in the hospital and he was pretty sick. I've spent a lot of time with cancer patients at my job before med school so while I had seen people who were similarly sick, I wasn't prepared to see him dazed, in and out of a benzo/opioid fog only able to say a few sentences at a time. The initial game plan was to get him to surgery, do high dose radiation to his chest and spine, then wait for a month postop to decide whether he could start chemo or not. 

He made it through surgery okay. The next several days were difficult as he was struggling to recover. He was paralyzed on the left side from the tumor and was frustrated with the aggressive PT. Conversations started to change and he decided to get discharged to a hospice house, with the intent to transfer home once he was independent enough to do so. I was prepared for him to die within days, since everyone's outlook was pretty bleak. But he kept hanging in there. 

Christmas break for me was similarly stressful. I am very grateful that I got to spend time with him, but it's hard to sleep and relax when you know your uncle will be dying. We got to spend a few hours alone together, and since he had recovered a little from surgery he was now able to have a proper conversation with me. It was sad to see him still exhausted, wasting away, and paralyzed, but it was better than he was in the hospital. 

He made it all the way through Christmas break. Everyone suspected that the lung tumors would grow aggressively and that once he needed oxygen, he would rapidly decline. But he kept satting okay on his own, only using a nebulizer when he started to cough. 

Conversations started to shift again. He wasn't fully independent like he needed to be but he was stabilizing, more or less. There was a question of whether or not he might be able to start therapy just to give him a few months. He was supposed to get discharged from hospice to his house- after two months being in the hospital/hospice- last Friday. Everything was ready. The hospital bed had been installed in the first floor, my aunt was trained to take care of him, etc. 

Then the hallucinations started. He had a difficult time distinguishing what was real and what wasn't. I thought it might have been the lack of sleep, and there was a whole other issue where his dog escaped and went missing for 5 days, so I had hoped some of it was stress. 

I called my dad last night when I was driving home from work. I geeked out about the stuff I had learned today since he's a physician. We were talking about the pathophysiology of Hodgkin's disease. I could tell something was off, so naturally I asked how things were going with my uncle. 

""I spoke to the doctor today. She thinks this is the end of things, and that Benji has a few days left. He's having more neurologic symptoms. Could be brain swelling vs. new tumor.""

""Well if we don't knew if it's a tumor why don't they restart the steroids? If it's just swelling there's a chance he can ride this out."" 

""I don't know the answer to that. I'm sorry. You should give him a call and leave him a voicemail."" 

What do you say to a dying 44 year old who meant so much to you? All I remember is telling him I loved him, that he will always be my favorite uncle, and that we would take care of his family. 

He wasn't awake when I called, but I asked my aunt to tell me when she played it to him. 

I woke up this morning to a call from my dad. I guess Benji went to sleep last night and just didn't wake up, and died around 6:30 AM. I don't know if he heard my message, and I don't really want to ask. 

Benji was the best uncle I could have asked for. He was super invested in my life, especially before having kids of his own. He was super tech-y and always showed us cool stuff like digital cameras, and his Atari. He eventually went to dentistry school- not because he was particularly passionate about dentistry, but because he knew it was a stable career choice. He ended up being passionate about community dentistry and spent most of his time taking care of low-income patients. His last job was working on establishing a low-income dental clinic. He was funny, like a really crass kind of funny that was mostly appropriate for kids but occasionally got darting glances from my mom when he was toeing the line. He was a wonderful dad to my two cousins, and a really good husband to his wife. He was a good, healthy person and everything about this situation is unfair. 

I feel pretty numb about everything. It's exceptionally difficult to study medicine when it just failed your family, big-time. There's seemingly no justice in the fact that I have a 92 year old great-grandma who is still alive and a 44 year old dad of two teenagers died. I also feel guilty because when I was talking to my dad earlier this week, I had told him that part of me wanted it to be over because I was so exhausted of worrying about him. I worry that maybe some weird karmic bullshit took me seriously. I *really* hope he heard my voicemail. 

To Benji: I meant what I said last night. I love you so much. I love the fact that you were actively part of my life even when we lived thousands of miles away from each other. I am really devastated that you couldn't see me graduate med school, or see my sister graduate college, or even see your kids go to prom. I hope you know that we will take care of your family now, and make sure they're okay. I know we used to tease you guys about living so close to us but maybe it was a sign from the universe that we needed to spend more time together. I'm gonna keep going through med school because it's what I really want from my life, but I'm gonna make sure that I don't lose myself in medicine. I hope that's what you would have wanted from me. I'll have to go back to Hana every few years because it's my favorite place on earth, too. I'll miss you more than you could ever imagine. I love you.

She doesn't realize that treatment is just a way to extend her life, not a cure. She's very tired all the time and her left side and balance don't work properly (brain tumor) but she refuses to get anyone to help her at home with daily chores, so she just stopped cleaning altogether. I come and visit when I can and one of my brothers takes care of her the rest (most) of the time, but he works during the day. Some days she's ok and can walk to and from the bathroom alone, others she can't or risks falling every step she takes. She wakes up twice a night to go to the bathroom and needs help doing these short trips (about 20 feet). She already fell a few times and now has a scar on her face because of her lack of balance. Recently I ended up changing her diaper and cleaning poop off of her and out of her bed. My brother and her both insists she doesn't need help. She also can't fix her own food. 

I feel like this is no way of living and the good relationship I once had with my mom is gone. Sometimes I find myself wishing it would be over sooner... I feel bad about it... but it hurts to see my mom in this state with no help and no idea what's going on. Any advice on the situation would be welcome.",2020-01-12 15:15:14

I‚Äôm 17 and my mom has been diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer for a little over 4 months now. I hate even saying it but i feel like i haven‚Äôt accomplished much for her during this time. I have helped a lot more around the house and have offered emotional support. I‚Äôve really wanted to make memories I can look back on since she won‚Äôt be here. I want to make every day count and live in the present but when I try it just feels like sand slipping through my fingers. it KILLS me. It eats away at my soul. I appreciate every single day God gives me with her, and put extra thought and love into the words I speak to her and the gifts ive given her. But I feel like it isn‚Äôt enough...... 

we have never really been the kind to do stuff together.  One thing is that technology takes away from our family time and my parents don‚Äôt seem to realize it. When I think back, and I mean think REALLY hard,  a lot of the time I struggle to come up with memories of her. it might just be the weight of it all that‚Äôs consuming my every thought, but it seriously depresses me either way. We went on our first vacation together this year to the beach but I didn‚Äôt touch the sand once with her, I feel so guilty and just sad, it was the only vacation we will ever get to go on together. I will probably forever wish I had went on the beach with her. In the grand scheme of things that isn‚Äôt important right now but it still upsets me that I let such valuable things slip away. 

I do have some special memories of her in my heart, but I think ever since this psychiatrist I used to see tried to implant false memories in my head I have a better time at remembering bad memories of her than good. the doctor tried so hard to make me believe my mom was abusive and was practically begging me to take Prozac. I definitely will treasure the happy moments I‚Äôve had with her. 

I already said I would start NOW at making an effort of this stuff, and that was 4 months ago. A lot of the time I keep to myself in my room  like I always have, and then I‚Äôm like ‚Äòwhy am I in here binging shows when I could be with mom‚Äô and then go talk to her. it‚Äôs honestly pathetic how much time I have spent to myself, probably me numbing myself to what‚Äôs happening around me. My friends families seem so interconnected and have family nights and watch movies together and my family is the complete opposite. I feel like if I start proposing we eat dinner together or ask to watch a movie together my mom and dad will think I‚Äôm trying to make up for time lost or something. It all just seems SO foreign to me now, even sitting down for a meal. 

School starts back Thursday and I‚Äôm going to try and get on homebound. I was considering it 4 months ago but I was apprehensive. My best friend at the time who Is now long gone told me ‚Äòwhat do you value more, your last year of high school or your last moments with your mom?‚Äô And it hasn‚Äôt left my mind. I could give up school in a second, I don‚Äôt really have any friends left or any desire to go. Ever since my moms diagnosis I‚Äôve lost that best friend of 5 years and I talk to no one outside of school. Only reason I‚Äôve stayed in school was school work. I also need to take off bc my dad has been away from work for several months to take care of her and during that time we haven‚Äôt made a dime, his boss is begging him to return. So now it‚Äôs my time to really step it up.",2019-12-29 17:19:00

We are currently waiting for the next ct scan results in agony and fear, which will be ready next week. I am so afraid the cancer has spread or the chemo's not working.

What I want to talk about today though (or really just vent, I‚Äôm having a really hard day) is how even when you‚Äôre ‚Äúused to it‚Äù, it‚Äôs the little things that are quietly just as painful, but there‚Äôs very little support out there when these things come up.

My mom has stage 4 lung cancer, and has been lucky enough to be doing well most days. She receives care at Red Rocks Cancer Center in Colorado and her doctor has a revolutionary radiation technique that has helped her last this long (she is on Medicaid, otherwise there is no way we could afford it). I am her sole provider and much of the time her sole support system as well. My sister, who is 9 years older, is mostly useless, and comes and goes and is a good daughter when she feels like it. I know I am very lucky she‚Äôs been able to get the treatment she has, as most do not have the additional years she‚Äôs been afforded once they hit stage 4.

The last couple days, she‚Äôs been hurting really bad and in particular, she‚Äôs in a lot of pain when she gets up and moves or when she breathes in deeply. Her concern is that she has pneumonia again, which happens a few times a year as a result of inflammation from the many inhalers she has. 

I got home from my 2nd job last night after a 17 hour day, exhausted, but my mom wasn‚Äôt doing well. At one point, I asked if she was about to go to sleep and she said ‚Äúshe was afraid to sleep‚Äù, so I stayed up too and watched some TV with her. Finally she felt ok to sleep so I did too. After a couple hours, I woke up to go to work and found myself watching my mom, who was still sleeping, to make sure she was still breathing.

These are the things that I find it hard to explain to others, because how could you possibly understand unless you also are very aware that it‚Äôs possible you could wake up, but your loved one might not? I feel useless in my ability to comfort her because I cannot even pretend to know how she feels. These smaller moments are more devastating to me than the big ones - the tests, the scans, the appointments, the hospital visits even. In those times, I know there are teams of medical professionals far better equipped to handle all of this than I am, and I know she‚Äôs in good hands. When it‚Äôs 1 in the morning and she‚Äôs telling me she‚Äôs scared to go to sleep, it‚Äôs just me, and I have no idea what to say or do.

Thanks for letting me rant y‚Äôall. It was a rough night, resulting in a tough day.",2019-10-17 01:06:47

"Father walked me down the aisle 1 month ago, now he is dying of lymphoma",9,dfs0ab,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/dfs0ab/father_walked_me_down_the_aisle_1_month_ago_now/,5,1570705849.0,"Just over a month ago my father walked me down the aisle on my wedding day. He was so proud of me, so happy. It was truly one of the best days of my life. Shortly after, he started getting sick, belly pain, losing weight suddenly. After about a month of doctors telling him it was nothing, he ended up in the ER just a week ago. They finally ran tests. They told us they thought it was cancer. Abdominal, maybe pancreatic. I Googled it, and convinced myself that there was no hope, no cure, he was dying. Stage 4 pancreatic, definitely, I figured.

Meanwhile, I was abroad for a work trip when all of this was happening. I flew home early, and after an excruciatingly exhausting and tearful 48 hrs of travel went straight to the hospital to see him with my mom. He was semi lucid, gave a big smile when he saw me, but couldn't talk much, only mumble a word here or there. He had lost so much weight over just a few days. He arms had withered away to nothing. He wasn't able to eat much, and over the course of just a few hours he stopped being able to swallow. He stopped opening his eyes. Stopped mumbling. 

The oncologist finally called us in. The biopsy results weren't complete yet, but from some of the fluid tested they were able to get a diagnosis. It wasn't late stage pancreatic cancer, not pancreatic cancer at all- not the automatic death sentence we had thought. No, instead, it was large cell lymphoma, a cancer that responds to treatment. Now, if he was stronger, if the diagnosis had come a week, a month ago, maybe it would have been good news. But he has declined so much, so rapidly, that it doesn't make a difference that there is a path for treatment. He is leaving us.

My father walked me down the aisle just a month ago, and now he is quickly dying. This doesn't feel real. It can't be real. I don't know what our family will do without him. I just want to dance with him again.",2019-10-10 11:10:49

After jaw reconstruction, losing 60% of his tongue, the dysphagia (unable to swallow), chemo and radiation, the tumor returned, and is now pushing on nerves and arteries in his neck. This is causing episodes of syncope, in which he's basically put into a sleeper hold and faints. A lot of the time is triggered by the intense pain he feels in the area of the tumor. Eyes wide open, blood pressure drops, he's dizzy and sometimes vomits or loses control of his bladder or bowels. All we can do is elevate his feet and lower his head and try to get his blood pressure back up until he comes back around. He's been in the hospital for a week now dealing with this, and doctors are still trying to find the right balance of pain management and techniques to keep his blood pressure up at all times.

He's had a feeding tube since Janurary, so he's lost a lot of weight and muscle, he's very weak. He's strung out on morphine every day in the hospital just to try to keep the pain away. He's got a blister on his face from radiation, right over the new jaw, that is being traumatized by the cancer. It won't heal unless the cancer is removed, and if/when it is he'll probably need plastic surgery to repair his face. This isn't quality of life. His only option is immunotherapy, and my mother and I are fighting to get it started right away. The smaller the tumor, the less is can attack these blood vessels and nerves, and hopefully the less pain he'll feel.

I feel like we're grasping at this point. I'm so lost, I can't even see the next step in the game plan. Laying it all out like that makes it so much scarier. I'm so scared, and I'm so angry for him. He doesn't deserve all this torture. He's a musician, an animal lover, he's my daddy, he's a wonderful, caring person. We knew this fight was going to be difficult, but I'm not so sure any of us can take anymore.

Last night his episode was so bad, I honestly wondered, *is this how it ends? is he dying tonight?* And I almost felt relieved to think he wouldn't be suffering from this anymore. And then I absolutely hated myself for thinking that, I will never give up on him.

Somebody please tell me there's a light at the end of this tunnel, and I just can't see it yet. This has been the saddest, scariest, most exhausting 8 months of all of our lives. This can't all have been for nothing.",2019-07-12 02:11:36
my family won‚Äôt admit that my dad is dying,8,c6dgck,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/c6dgck/my_family_wont_admit_that_my_dad_is_dying/,8,1561711409.0,"hello pals! This is my first time posting here but I‚Äôm just looking for advice I guess. Sorry, this is going to be a bit long. 

A bit of backstory, my dad got diagnosed with colon cancer last November. My parents started to essentially not divulged any information about the severity etc. He‚Äôs been doing chemo, had a colon resection, and unfortunately his tumour markers that at first went down are now climbing. . They refuse to tell me real information, so I‚Äôve had to take bits of things they‚Äôve said to piece things together. I‚Äôm also in nursing school so I have access to a lot of knowledge that leaves me more curious/wanting to know what‚Äôs going on. I also found out a few weeks ago that there are multiple tumours on his liver (I think they knew this months ago but I have to kinda pry to even know what‚Äôs going on). My mom finally admitted that he has stage 4 colon cancer and has moved to his liver. 
He seems to be getting worse and worse, and that‚Äôs what the medical information is saying, but my parents don‚Äôt say anything other than ‚Äúhe‚Äôs good‚Äù and ‚Äúthis is the healthiest he‚Äôs been‚Äù.  They‚Äôre sort of using this intense positivity to cope, which I understand, but not knowing what‚Äôs happening with him and if there‚Äôs limited time is absolutely killing me. 
I‚Äôve tried to have many heart to heart conversations with my mom about it, but she shuts me out and gets so angry when I even ask if he‚Äôs getting better/worse. They keep telling me that he‚Äôll just do chemo indefinitely, but I know that‚Äôs not possible, and incredible devastating on the body. 
From the last talk we had and the information I got (re:liver tumours) and the type of care he is receiving, my mind is telling me he is palliative. This isn‚Äôt really a guess, but I don‚Äôt want to believe it either. 

My heart has honestly never felt so broken. Has anyone experienced anything like this?",2019-06-28 08:43:29

I‚Äôve been sorting out the funeral arrangements and the council came round my mums house yesterday and said we have 3 weeks to sort her things out and be gone; suggesting that my brother and I present at homeless so we can get on the housing list (I am 26years old, my brother is 29). I asked what this involved and she told me that we would be out in temporary accommodation- no thanks. I‚Äôve just lost my mum, had the worst Christmas and new year of my life and my mental health is seriously deteriorating and they expect us to go homeless?? 
The fact they‚Äôve only given me 3 weeks to sort through my mums house which only gives me 2 weeks after the funeral to completely empty it ready for the next person. 
I haven‚Äôt even fully sorted the funeral out as my mum didn‚Äôt have insurance and it‚Äôs all been left to me to do. I keep feeling like I‚Äôm making huge mistakes all the time and I just want everything to be perfect.
My brothers aren‚Äôt of much help practically- my older brother who is 29 has autism and I‚Äôm his carer.

Husband just diagnosed,7,jj1w27,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/jj1w27/husband_just_diagnosed/,10,1603836876.0,"Hello everyone. My husband was just diagnosed last week. Two months ago, he started having pain in his back. When it got worse, we went to the doctor. They thought it might be a muscle strain and sent him to physical therapy.  It wasn't until last week that they discovered a fracture in his lower spine and the cancer. In addition to all this, he has COPD.

My daughter did some research and it is a treatable cancer with a good survivability rate, 60 to 80 percent. Assuming we can get on top of it and stay on top of it. But I still feel like he is going to die. 

I could deal with this news if he wasn't in so much pain. They finally put him on Oxycodone. I really hope it helps him. I've been told how strong I was to deal with this, but I don't feel strong. I just feel scared. 

We've been together for over 20 yrs. I keep wondering how I'm going to deal with it if he does die. How am I going to help my daughter? How will we survive financially? We have a little money from a settlement but it isn't going to last forever. Working from home is my only option right now, but I can't seem to find anything. So now I have to worry about how to promote myself on top of trying to help my husband get through each day. I have to not cry in front of my daughter because that will only scare her. Inwardly, I feel frantic and overwhelmed. Outwardly, I try to keep a positive outlook for the sake of both my daughter and my husband.

Yesterday he started choking on mere spit. I was terrified. I managed to get him on his side and he was able to breathe a little better. There's other things, little things, that also worry me. When he gets grouchy and snaps at me or our daughter because of the pain, I don't get mad at him, I know he can't help it and he immediately apologizes when he snaps at me or our daughter. That, I can handle. He's always been a kind of grouchy guy, but he's got a heart of gold. 

What I can't handle, is how affectionate he's been lately. Reaching out to touch my hand and tell me how much he loves me and how he couldn't get through this without the love and support of me and our daughter. It scares me because until the last few months, he's never been overly demonstrative like this. It makes me feel like he's giving up. Like he is going to die. 

I guess I'm not really asking for anyone to tell me it will be ok because nobody can guarantee that. I just have to fight harder to help him. I'm sorry for the long post, but all that nattering leads up to my actual question. Is there anything I can do to help ease the pain for him? Does anyone have any tips that might be helpful?",2020-10-27 22:14:36
I'm just so mad right now (Covid-19),8,jemlfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/jemlfd/im_just_so_mad_right_now_covid19/,1,1603217369.0,"My dad has extensive SCLC (lung cancer) and has just finished chemo, will receive immunotherapy for the rest of his life. His prognosis is pretty bad, with hopefully a year left. My mum is pretty weak herself and while she's never been diagnosed with a weaker immune system, whenever she does get sick, she gets sick *real bad*. Illnesses that are normally 'quite bad' have been known to nearly threaten her life, including the flu. She is in her sixties, my dad is 71.

Currently, we have a huge increase of Corona and so they tried to distance themselves from anyone and everyone by spending time in their holiday home, if only because, well, my dad doesn't have long to live and it's his reason to keep on going to treatments for now.

This places them quite close to my aunt (mum's sister) who lives in an extremely high risk region - and who seemed to not give a shit about the virus at all, mocking it, etc. Last week she had visited her new born grandchild and got pissy at her daughter-in-law because she had to wear a mask.

Either how, on Thursday or Friday, while I was on the phone with my mum, she tells me her sister is going to come by on Saturday. I instantly dislike it. But she assures me she'll try to be safe, keep distance, not touch a thing, etc. That she feels bad for telling her sister not to come 'because you know it'll just be a fight'. I get it, she's the only support, besides me, that my mum has with my dad being sick.

I wanted to push my mum to not let her come over. But I didn't. I just reiterated how to be safe. I tried to fool myself to believe I was just overreacting, and I should let my parents have at least this. Because *what are even the odds?!*

Yesterday, I'm on the phone with my mum. While my dad kept his distance, my mum actually drove around with her sister. My mum wore a mask, but her sister *didn't.* Inside I'm fuming, but I try not to lash out at my mum, I don't want her to feel guilty in case things do end up bad. I wanted to wait to scold her like she was my child, for real, but I also didn't want to make her feel guilty about what I consider to be just stupid behaviour, considering both my parents are high risk, in case they did get sick.

Today, my mum calls. Her sister is ill. Fever, headache, cough, the whole works. She's going to get tested. My parents won't, since we're running low on tests it's reserved for those with symptoms. My dad, as part of his treatment, does get tested next week (as everyone does before entering the hospital as a patient, even if just for a few hours), but having come into contact with a confirmed case is no longer a reason to test. There's also a backlog, so if it's a cold or covid - it could take up to 5 days to know. 

My aunt actually already had a headache on Saturday, wasn't feeling well and irritable. She still decided to come to my parents, while having so many risky contacts herself in what is the country's hot spot right now.

I'm so mad right now. Mad at myself, for not pressing my mum to not see her sister. Mad at my mum for sitting in a car with her. Mad at my aunt. Mad at everyone that just laughed it off.

I stand to be alone in the world. No siblings. No in-laws. No one. All because I couldn't push myself to get angry at my mum, to tell her she was being stupid, to call my aunt myself, to tell her I'd never forgive her.

And I don't think I ever will forgive my aunt if my parents do get sick. I don't know what will come of it, but right now all I can see is how I will be alone, alone if my parents are in the hospital, alone if one of them dies while the other is still in the hospital, alone if they both die. How I will have to care for their pets (dogs) as well as mine (cats) that don't mingle. Arrange everything. And how I won't have my dad to nag me, or my mum to help me.  How I won't even get to say goodbye. How, when they get home this weekend, I won't even be able to say hi, because the last thing any of us needs, is me sick as well. 

I know he's dying, I know he doesn't have much longer to live, but it shouldn't be due to this.

I'm sorry, I just had to tell someone how I felt.",2020-10-20 18:09:29
How to support my family,7,iv6xyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/iv6xyx/how_to_support_my_family/,2,1600467602.0,"I‚Äôm currently at home with my parents. My dad just found out he has cancer which seemed easily curable at first, but as of last night we found out the doctor told him the wrong results and it looks bad now. We don‚Äôt know yet if it‚Äôs spread or how far it‚Äôs spread, but in the meantime I‚Äôm wondering what I can do for them.

My parents didn‚Äôt really sleep last night and everything is heavy today. We have a week until we will find out more. What can I do for them? 

I typically try to lighten the mood in my family when required. My plan more or less is to feel things and be sincere when the mood requires it, but otherwise lighten the mood every good opportunity I get. I‚Äôm typically good at lightening moods, but I also want to show him I care. 

When we first found out he has cancer, I hugged him and we talked about how we‚Äôre going to get through it... now after we found out the actual results I‚Äôm unsure of how to approach things. He has always been so strong. But yesterday and today he is struggling to keep himself together. I never even talked to him about it yesterday. My mom told me the new results and he spent the day setting up appointments. Afterwards I tried to join him while he was working out but he left right after I joined. Then later on he had to lay down and was sick to his stomach from stress. I went out to get him some soup from a restaurant he likes, and we watched tv together at night. I‚Äôm almost apprehensive to hug him and be emotional with him because we typically have never been emotional with each other and I know he doesn‚Äôt like to seem weak. I feel that me being emotional with him might break him down, but at the same time I don‚Äôt want him to think I don‚Äôt care because I am trying to stay upbeat. I‚Äôm also afraid that maybe I am being insincere and just trying to protect myself by avoiding having an emotional moment with him.

Cancer diagnosis is destroying my relationship. Help.,8,imjena,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/imjena/cancer_diagnosis_is_destroying_my_relationship/,4,1599266552.0,"Hi all,

I tried posting this to relationship\_advice but no responses. Kind of expected, since it's such a specific situation. Not sure if this is allowed to be posted here, but I'm hoping this sub might be able to help.   

A few months ago, my partner (30M) was diagnosed with cancer. The stress has amplified communication problems that already existed in our relationship. There are overarching things like wondering if we have the same long term goals and dreams, as he‚Äôs very much a ‚Äòlive for today‚Äô kind of person and I‚Äôm a future planner. However, our lives have been overshadowed by this diagnosis and the following things feel like the immediate issues:

\- Currently, he‚Äôs still healthy, living a pretty unaffected life by the disease (physically). He took a leave from work at the advice of his doctor, just to see how he reacts to treatment. He‚Äôs on immunotherapy so he‚Äôs been feeling great and hasn‚Äôt had any side effects. He spends his days doing outdoor activities and exploring areas nearby. This is great, but it‚Äôs left me with a lot of the ‚Äòadult‚Äô responsibilities. I do all the cleaning, most of the meal prep, grocery shopping, and anything else that falls under household chores. Sometimes he‚Äôll start a project at the house, get bored halfway through, and just leave it. I‚Äôm left to clean up the aftermath or finish what was started. I want him to live his fullest life, but I feel like I‚Äôm more his mother than his partner right now. 

\- He‚Äôs very sensitive about talking about his disease/treatment. I recognize this might be how he‚Äôs coping, but he‚Äôs intentionally left me out of very important appointments when the doctor discusses test results and the path forward. When I ask for the details, I can see he gets agitated. From his perspective, he can‚Äôt see why I need every detail. From mine, having the details makes me feel more secure in this situation. We can‚Äôt seem to meet in the middle. 

\- He doesn‚Äôt understand my sadness through this. He has taken on an extremely positive attitude, but I have been struggling with an intense depression since the diagnosis. I‚Äôm seeing two counselors to get this under control, but some days, I am just so down. My partner doesn‚Äôt understand and only sees it as negativity, which he doesn‚Äôt want. It takes away my ‚Äòsafe space‚Äô in him and puts a lot of pressure on me.

\- Sex has completely halted. Nothing intimate in the past 4 months. I would say we rarely kiss or touch anymore. The constant strain doesn‚Äôt make either of us feel like being intimate. Whenever I talk to him about it, he clams up. It‚Äôs like he doesn‚Äôt know what to say except ‚Äòwe‚Äôll have sex tonight‚Äô and then we just don‚Äôt... 

Honestly, that‚Äôs not everything, but I feel like those are the bigger problems and I have no idea how to solve them. Everything is a battle right now and I just keep waiting for us to come together like I read on cancer support forums. We‚Äôve been together for a long time and I can‚Äôt envision a life without him. He‚Äôs been part of some of my most formative years and the thought of splitting up makes me feel lost. However, this honestly feels so loveless at this point, I‚Äôm not sure I can survive being this starved in a relationship. It‚Äôs causing a lot of unhappiness in both of us. Not only am I scared to be without him as a partner, but without him in general if treatment doesn‚Äôt work. I typically shy away from hard decisions in my life for the sake of staying ‚Äòcomfortable.‚Äô It's safe to say , I don't like change, especially change I don't control. I think about the options we have, and I feel immense guilt going in either direction:

1. We remain in this relationship, and by some miracle, we end up getting through this rough patch. While we try to work through it, I will be worried and stressed thinking about possibly wasting whatever time he has left. 

2. We split up and I can‚Äôt cope without him. I continue to worry about him and his health, but now I‚Äôm even more removed from the details that provide me security. I‚Äôm also not sure I can look myself in the mirror knowing I left someone during the hardest part of their life. I will feel like a monster. 

I'm really hoping someone here might be able to identify with this and help me/us navigate the harshness of this situation. I feel cancer has stolen our lives and I am really angry about it. Recently I asked him if this whole diagnosis hadn‚Äôt happened, do you think we‚Äôd be in such dire straits? He told me no and it broke my heart. Life is fucking unfair. I‚Äôm sure he has a laundry list of things he‚Äôs unhappy about with me as well. I do recognize that. Should we continue on and fight through this emotional pain? Or move on, even though it's going to hurt like hell?  This is the most difficult thing I‚Äôve ever gone through and I feel like I‚Äôm not equipped to make the tough decisions.

I live in France and my parents live in Italy, I came last week to visit after a long period without seeing them because of the lockdown.


My dad has liver problems and hemochromatosis so his blood is taken and cheked regularly. A couple of weeks ago he had a screening and apparently a lot of values were off scale, he had an exam and they found a tumor in his liver.
I took him to the hospital on Wednesday, I wasn't inside and I just have a report of what my mom said: it is in a position where is almost impossible to operate, it has already spread a little, they are planning a therapy and meanwhile we'll see a surgeon next week to have his opinion.
My parents are both devastated and I'm scared as hell.


They've spent all their life smoking and trying to stop without much result, I thought after the news they would have at least tried to reduce. I was so wrong. 
They both usually start smoking at 9am and continue no-stop till late evening. I've talked to my mum yesterday, she said she knows they should smoke less, expecially now. Today it was like we never had that talk.
This evening after dinner my father smoked a cigarette, I didn't say anything. Just about 5 minutes after that, he had another one. When he tried to light up the third one in a row I had to tell him not to. Well, not even 5 minutes after that my mom tried to light up another one too. I feel like I have to scold them like children.

The loss of my Grandad has also exacerbated my anxiety about my Dad. Life‚Äôs is so precious and short. I‚Äôm worried about COVID, serious side effects of his treatment, or recurrence of the cancer.

My mother has Stage 4 Lymphoma and it has already gone terminal. It has spread all over her body and now she is experiencing immense pain. It is extremely hard to watch. We can't do anything but to give her painkillers. I'm just 19, all throughout childhood, I had watch how my family became broken with so much anger and hatred due to my parents' marriage. My mom directed her anger at my brother and I which has deeply damaged us mentally however, I understood why she did it and beared with it. Even if I found it so unfair but I can't do anything about her own character. I know that she still loves me and I still love her despite everything that has happened in my life. We don't have a proper mother and daughter relationship due to a language barrier which caused misunderstandings as well as my mom's dictator like personality.

But then, she has cancer for 3 years and when I just recieved the news, I was devastated. She didn't deserve this! I just don't understand why she had it in the first place. I begin to think that we were cursed and that we deserved it. I became less religious when I was younger due to my troubled childhood, and to me, I think God is just a creator and doesn't perform any miracles. You need to earn it through your own hard work and if miracles did happen to you, I merely thought it was just coincidence and luck. Please don't preach at me. I don't need anybody to talk to me about God. I have people coming up to me and tell me that it could be karma. It could be. But I don't want to think about it. I just hoped that my mother would be there for my wedding and meet her future children but that wouldn't be possible.
I feel like what's the point in all this. Is it to test me on how strong I am? Well I've lost and you won whoever is messing up with my life.

My mom got lung cancer, a very agressive form of lung cancer called small-cell carcinoma, you cannot cure from it and it's cause by smoking almost at 100%.
My mom used to smoke a lot and started at a very young age.
I don't know how it works in the States but in France the government taxes cigarettes a lot and makes a lot of profit out of it. They pretend to care with useless measures like increasing the price every year but every specialist will confirm that IT DOESN'T WORK. So do they really want people to stop? Of course they don't.
We have a great Healthcare system but this issue isn't taken seriously like other addictions, it's normalized and it shouldn't.
Anyone would be uncomfortable next to someone taking cocain right? It should be the same with smoking (especially since smoking is also dangerous for people around).
Nicotine is as addictive as heroin studies found, so what are we waiting for?

Thank you for reading me and if you smoke, please try getting helped, you can do it.


Edit : When my mom started smoking, there were adds on TV, they even said smoking was good for your health. I don't judge people that smoke because they are sick, they have an addiction and they should be treated as such no matter what reason led them to smoke.",2020-07-02 07:20:28

My mom (58) was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer back in March. At that time, she didn't really have any symptoms but went to her doctor after she asked me to look at a lump in her abdomen (I'm a new graduate nurse so no expert but people still tend to ask me for medical advice, haha). I'm 21 and I was just finishing up my last semester of college. I came home for break and saw her in April, she was her normal self, only symptoms being a little bit of nausea and stomach aches.

I just returned home after graduating and finishing up my last few shifts as a nursing assistant at a hospital in my college town. She's currently in the hospital, being discharged tomorrow. She was unrecognizable. I think that my sister tried to downplay how bad it had gotten to save my feelings, but now I feel as though I wasted these last few months without her. She was lethargic and disoriented, her speech is slurred to where she can hardly speak. She didn't know who I was when I entered the room, she thought I was my sister for a little bit, and then thought I was her nurse. She won't eat anything and is in and out of sleep all day and all night.

I think I'm having a lot of anticipatory grief. It's frustrating because it makes it so hard to enjoy the time I have with her when it's all I can do not to cry when I see her. I'm scared. I don't know how to do any of this. I thought I would have so much more time with her.

After my parents divorced, she started to date a man who abused my sister and me. She didn't believe us when we told her. Eventually, my dad found out and her boyfriend went to prison, but before he went she married him and spent a long time trying to make my sister and me admit that we had lied (which, of course, we hadn't). She eventually came around but this very damaging to my relationship with her, and it all got kind of swept under the rug and we don't really speak about it. I knew she was still my mom and that she loved me and I planned to have that conversation and forgive her one day, but I thought it would be years from now. I couldn't talk about any of that with her now even if I decided I wanted to, I don't think she would be able to.

My parents are in Sydney, Australia while I‚Äôm in London. I wanted to be there, but with work and travel restrictions, I had to stay put. I‚Äôm not sure if it was because I was in shock and things hadn‚Äôt fully sunk in, but it was weirdly easy for me to accept that there was nothing I could do, though I knew I would get to her eventually.

Now it‚Äôs months later and I‚Äôm seeing the effect chemo is having on her. I no longer feel okay with not being there. I need to be with her, but it seems harder than ever. Though cases of the coronavirus have lessened, Australia still has strict travel restrictions in place. The 20+ hour flight from London to Sydney still doesn‚Äôt feel like the most sensible thing to do right now, and I would need to quarantine in a hotel for two weeks upon my arrival before I could even think about seeing my mum. I‚Äôm not even sure if work would let me leave for that long, and what if there‚Äôs still a risk I could get her sick?

The guilt and worry is making it hard for me to focus on anything else. While it‚Äôs very likely she‚Äôll be fine, what if she isn‚Äôt, and I have to live with the regret of not being there for her?

My mother, sister and brother are all very upset, obviously. I live at home with my parents so I've been in the loop every step and know his prognosis isnt great (about a year with chemo). My dad (who hasn't hugged me practically ever) broke down hugging me when he was diagnosed. I just hugged back and spouted positivity. Afterwards, I sat for a bit, feeling sad and stressed, but didn't cry. I went for a walk and felt like my head was going to explode with thoughts, but not overtly sad. I think I've just come to terms and accepted the inevitable very quickly.

My brother, who doesn't even know he won't ever get 'better' has apparently been crying himself to sleep and avoiding social contact. My sister has been visiting a lot and cries to me/mum. My mum cries a lot to me so she doesn't have to in front of my dad. 

I feel sad that he can't ever eat chips or a roast dinner because his cancer is in his oesophagus and he can't process certain foods.I dread the weakened state he'll be in after chemo.

The only symptom he had before his diagnosis was decreased mental clarity and increased memory loss, but this developed very gradually over the course of like 2 years before he decided to get it checked out. now that he has been through radiation and is starting chemo, however, he is like a totally different person.

He was on high dose steroids for a few weeks, which sent him into a full-blown psychosis that made it impossible for him to stay at home because he was so aggressive with his immediate family (me, . he‚Äôs been staying with his sister about an hour away and since then his psychosis symptoms have slowly decreased, but now the chemo has him lethargic, nauseous to the point of not being able to eat at all, and he‚Äôs very depressed.

It broke me. She‚Äôs the strongest person I know. Breadwinner of our home & basically my only real caregiver because my father never really stepped up. 

She completed chemo a few months back. I knew it wasn‚Äôt time for celebration, but we did anyway. One small victory. She developed neuropathy which was debilitating for her, since she was an active runner and overall health enthusiast. The woman has run marathons. She could barely walk a mile without her feet swelling and it killed her. She didn‚Äôt feel like the same person anymore. She keeps a positive attitude through it all and is the one person who makes me cry with laughter almost everyday.

Corona lockdown isolating my dad,7,fita6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/fita6e/corona_lockdown_isolating_my_dad/,5,1584263698.0,"So dad got cancer on his vocal chords.. been dealing with it for years now, cutting away small tumors now and then.. but always growing back after a while, so doc decided it was time for radiation therapy to try and kill it off for good. 

Fair enough, he's in good spirit, as it haven't really spread at all over the years, nor has he had any sideeffects other than a raspy voice when it came back. Just keeps coming back in the same general area. Thing is, his cancer doc is in another city, a short flight away from home. That's where the expertise is. Dad is also getting kinda forgetful. Ditzy I guess, is the word. And his sense of direction is on par with a kitten on ketamine. And his age, being single, he gets pretty lonely as well. So I've travelled with him for about 99% of the time, my brother in law stepped in once when I had to work. 

So back to now, his radiation therapy is a total six weeks, five weeks left now.. and this morning we got the call that they are kicking everyone not a patient out of the hotel connected to the hospital. Because of corona. So my sister that was taking over for me as I have to work next week, ends up at another hotel, and won't even be allowed access to where he is staying without his doc producing a document for it come Monday.. 

So I'm naturally worried as hell about his mental health. Since he got cancer to begin with years ago, he's never had to deal with it alone, or sit alone in his hotel room all day with no human contact. The mind start thinking dark thoughts easily when you feel all alone. 

I don't get the hospitals logic in all this. His legal companion mandated by his doctor, living at public Hotel, having to encounter random people, and take the bus to come meet him and follow him to treatments, is supposed to decrease risk of Covid-19 infection? And him having to leave the hotel to be social with his own daughter and have some human contact. I.e. potentially exposing himself to infected people, to not go mad by loneliness. 

If the doc don't signs a paper saying she can stay at the hotel with him on Monday I'm gonna let my nice guy mask slip and unleash god damn hellfire. It's inhuman to basically let a cancer patient be with no proper emotional support for 5 weeks, when the only other choice is to expose himself to potential Covid-19.

This lack of sleep makes him especially nasty, and he says extremely hurtful things.

What makes this especially hard, is until this past Christmas day, he hid most of this diagnosis from us - he has had this cancer for about 3 and half years. 

I have family members that have lost their absolute shit on him due to lack of sleep and his extremely insensitive comments.

All we want to do is help, but it feels like the more we help the more he gives up on bettering his situation.

He refuses to believe what the doctors say and he believes everyone is ""out to get him"". He lies to his doctors about his symptoms and pain and puts on a show whenever nurses are around.

It turns out what they thought was a cyst, is the cancer. We also found out today the cancer is not only in his knee but his ankle, foot, his lower thigh above the knee and on a rib, all on his left side. 
I‚Äôm not sure if the shock will ever wear off. We‚Äôre still waiting on pathology to know what kind it is and what stage, so it feels like a version of limbo hell. He‚Äôs 30 (will be 31 this year) and I‚Äôm about to turn 28 in a week, so the thought of this happening is beyond comprehensible still... especially with how healthy he normally eats, RARELY drinks, doesn‚Äôt smoke. I just don‚Äôt understand. 
We also have a 3 year old, who is such a daddy‚Äôs girl. Part of me is so scared of all of the unknown but I‚Äôm also trying to stay positive that everything will turn out okay. 
He was working full-time as a police officer and got injured on duty and is currently out on paid leave from the surgery they ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù found the cancer during. Very long story of how this all came about). But I‚Äôm worried about finances once that leave is over and treatments start (no idea what that‚Äôll be either yet).
I do work but I don‚Äôt make nearly enough to compensate for his salary. I had plans to go back to school once our daughter was in school herself, we both it would be easier that way just considering how crazy his schedule could be. My current job was just great being so flexible so at least one of us could be there more for our daughter and covers odds and ins bills; utilities, car payments, groceries, and whatever else I could help with. 
He said there‚Äôs ways to get financial help if we need it, some others that have gone through this have given him the details. I feel like I need to get a different job, one that pays more anyways. But then I‚Äôm worried I won‚Äôt be there enough to help him and take care our daughter. I‚Äôm also not sure what job I would get to cover bills, would I have to get two? Would that even be possible to work two AND take care of everyone? 
My parents have assured us they‚Äôll help with anything financially but I don‚Äôt want to put that on them. They already do so much for us as far as watching our daughter when we‚Äôre at work. 
This is where I‚Äôm kicking myself in the ass for being so indecisive in the past and not picking a major to stick with to finish school. 
I just want to do anything I can to help but I don‚Äôt even know where to start. He can‚Äôt walk on his own at all without crutches because of the incision healing and extreme leg pain so I‚Äôm waiting on him 24/7, which I don‚Äôt mind at all because he needs the help around the house. 
My mind is in a million places, more like panic mode. If there‚Äôs other family support apps or websites, I‚Äôd love to know them. 
I‚Äôm not a mentally strong person, I can fully admit that. I can put on a good front and be that rock for others but i know I‚Äôm going to be tested through all of this. 

We do have support from family members and his coworkers have been reaching out to him, along with others who have gone through treatment themselves. 
My mom keeps reminding me to take care of myself too, but I‚Äôm not sure I know how to on top of all of this.    The people pleaser in me would rather take care of those around me first, than myself. 
So maybe any advice on how to keep my stress levels down would be good. 
Any advice in general ... on anything would be helpful. 

Typing all my thoughts out here helped ease my emotions, I know people blog about these situations but I feel like most of mine would be a long ramble like everything above.",2020-03-07 13:01:20

I hope to compile some of your pains and problems to highlight the unmet needs of these patients so we can find more effective ways to improve our healthcare system. Below are a list of questions, please feel free to respond or DM me if you would like to talk more. Thank you for your time!

* What was the biggest issue you had with your/loved one‚Äôs cancer treatment?
* What would you change about your/loved one‚Äôs cancer treatment?
* What side effects did you experience/witness?
* If there had been an experimental treatment that was just as effective as the current therapy but may reduce side effects, would you try/explore it?
* How many days of work were missed due to severe side effects? 
* How did your side effects affect your loved ones or daily life?
* What are some things you wish other patients knew before starting their cancer treatment?
* If you could go back in time to before you started/completed chemotherapy, would you choose to do it again? Why or why not?

I have done extensive work in boundaries however forget everything I learned when talking with her. I am in counseling and have been for most of my adult life. Her life is pretty unrelatable to mine so we have very little in common. Why is it I have this stupid need to justify myself???

I don't do it with anyone else and I am going for try a new strategy in the future.

Six months after that I started having infrequent lightning pains on that side of my scalp. About a year after that my eyebrow stopped working. About a year ago the entire right side of my face went completely numb and now I look kind of crazy when I smile.

unfortunately I've been out of work for several months and got Medicaid. I wasn't planning on using it only in the case of like getting in a car accident or something. However about a month ago my IUD was about 6 months expired and really bothering me so I decided to use my Medicaid to get my birth control switched. The nurse practitioner I met with suggested we might as well investigate the facial numbness since I didn't have any co-pays. I felt guilty about using the Medicaid but proceeded. Blood test rule out a stroke. ENT ruled out fluid in the ear blocking the nerve. I have a brain scan next Friday and I'm absolutely terrified. I apologize for how selfish this sounds because they don't actually have a diagnosis. I know many of you are struggling with something concrete and something that affects you and your loved ones every day. My only family are my paternal grandparents and they're in their eighties. I just got two job offers this last week and I plan to take one of them starting on December 9th and I hope to have real insurance in January.

I think I've been ignoring it this long because the idea of getting a prognosis and having to go through it alone is incredibly terrifying. Not necessarily afraid to die or afraid of treatments, but once we figure out what it is... I don't know I don't have the words. I'll have to work with my new employer for at least a year before I qualify for FMLA. I think overall if I had to just pick one thing I'm scared about it's what if we find out what it is and I can't afford to get treatment. The whole pity party of the answer is right there but you can't have it because you make 60k a year, have student loan debt in a condo, and no one to pitch in financially just feels so empty and lonely.

On the last day he started having trouble breathing so they put him on an oxygen pump. We brought him home on the 4th day around 12pm. Neither he nor my mother slept that night because it was too difficult for him to breath so he had to constantly sit up and of course mom held him the whole night. The next day, he was in pain, at around 4pm his nurse came to inject some pain killers, I was helping dad sit up and suddenly his arm (where the UV was) blood started flowing down, I cupped my hand under it reassuring my dad that it's OK, he just looked at his arm, the nurse was about inject him with the painkillers and dad just fell over I didn't realize what happened until my mom screamed ""no! No!"" only then did I realize he wasn't breathing anymore, his eyes and mouth were wide open.

So about a month ago I posted about my momma being diagnosed with early stage breast cancer. The initial tests showed two miniscule tumors in her right breast, requiring a lumpectomy to remove, and radiation to reduce the chance of future issues. 

Well she had an MRI last Friday that resulted in three new lumps being located (one in right breast, two in left breast) and worrisome spots in her lymph nodes. Her surgeon has reduced her survival chance from 99% to about 50% at most, based on the MRI results. But we won't know more until the biopsies on these newly found masses come back in about a week. I'm sure he's just preparing us for the worst possible outcome, but I'm absolutely terrified. I know we can't possibly know for sure until the testing is completed, but the fact that her surgeon is genuinely worried makes me sick to my stomach. 

I don't want to lose my mom. I just lost my gramma unexpectedly last May, and my papa is currently in hospital for heart failure. If I have to deal with losing both my maternal grandparents and my mother in a year, I doubt I can ever recover.

When I first heard about my dads cancer I knew I had to be their for my mum and do everything I can to help her round the house. To me this was the most important in helping others who may be more emotional than me e.g my mum
However I put in this strong face for my mum and all friends acting like I was completely fine and nothing was wrong, but at nights I would see myself cry a little and just think about the worst. That brings me to my first point, try to not think about the worst, it‚Äôll only make you feel worse about yourself and the situation. 
I never spoke to anyone about my dads cancer, and I wish I did, even if it‚Äôs a small comment on how they are  doing or letting everything out to someone close to you, it will make you feel better, trust me. 
I was luckily enough that my gf was always there for me to talk to it about whenever I needed to when I was at my lowest points, find someone like that in which you can let ya feelings out to and be comforted by them.
Here‚Äôs a few things I learnt to help you get through the situation: 
1. Just cause your a boy does not mean you should not have feelings, it makes you more of a man to express them, even a little bit 
2. You are not alone, if you don‚Äôt feel comfortable in talking to a person in real life, Reddit is a great place to tell you story and feeing so others can help you
3. Your family is always there if you need help to get through it
4. But do stay strong for the people who need you, they will appreciate it and that might make you feel better about yourself
5. Don‚Äôt treat the person with cancer any different to before, they want to be seen as the Same person as before, which they are
6. When it‚Äôs all over it is worth the pain everyone wen through, trust me

Even if no one sees this I‚Äôm glad I got this off of my chest, even tho it‚Äôs over for me and my dad, it‚Äôs starting for millions of people around the world and I hope this can help someone out there ",2019-01-02 08:10:23

Backstory-

I‚Äôve been living at home going back to school for a new career for the last year. In the past few months my mother was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. She‚Äôs on immunotherapy so things have been going really well. I took time off dating cuz I was living at home. Now that my mom was diagnosed with cancer I decided life‚Äôs too short to set limitations for when I‚Äôm ready to date. About 2 weeks ago I went on a date with this amazing guy. The relationship has progressed slowly but fast in a short amount of time (FYI just kissing ;-) ) I feel horrible hiding this important part of my life and I don‚Äôt want to hide this information anymore. The good news he does work in the medical field so I‚Äôm hoping he‚Äôll understand. I just don‚Äôt know how to lay down the information.. ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm living with my parents and my mother has cancer‚Äù

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

I cant honestly say I'm alright, this experience is teaching me what  I'm capable under *duress*, but acknowledging the emotion difficulties kind of temporarily rips me apart, as its something I dont have the luxury of really doing right now. 

Regardless, I'm waaaaaay better at listening then talking, and through everything I've learned the horror of sitting alone wanting,*needing*  some way to... I dont know, let it out? or at least not feel what your feeling alone...

I'm always available, always logged in, and honestly... It may help just as much as you.

I'm shucking more and more sanity angrily out the window to make room for the willpower to smile as I walk into work, to tell my mother shes going to be alright when she calls crying from nightmares.

 I have friends, and family, but I cant let them in on how dark the world is right now. They need me to be strong, and I wont let them down.  I'm doing this almost alone and almost always blind, save the nights I get to much screen time before bed and get stuck just awake enough to start thinking...

&nbsp;

Dont be me.. I didn't mean for it to get dramatic and dark... but if you need someone to talk to, hit me (or anyone you feel you can) up. It doesn't need to be about struggles, sometimes its good to just have a normal conversation that doesn't make you recap everything.",2016-04-15 04:54:09

Mum‚Äôs mental problems escalating w caregiver stress,7,jghbvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/jghbvc/mums_mental_problems_escalating_w_caregiver_stress/,9,1603461392.0,"
TLDR; my dad‚Äôs long-standing terminal illness has deeply affected family dynamics and exacerbated mental health issues among caregivers, it‚Äôs come to a boiling point where caregivers are impaired when we are needed the most  - help !! 

‚Äî

My dad‚Äôs lived with cancer since I was 9; I am now 29. Over the past couple of years the cancer has metastasised and was kept under control with chemo, but now we are in the final phase with one last treatment that will give him a couple of months. That treatment has been paused due to a very major abdominal surgery and pneumonia in the past couple of months; he has been in and out of hospital three times in the last three to four weeks. It‚Äôs been insane to say the least. At one point during the abdominal surgery we thought that was goodbye.

Me and my Sister share caregiving duties with my mum, who is accustomed to being his primary caregiver since we were children. In times of extreme stress (when my dad is manifestly ill), my mum shows signs of extreme burnout ‚Äî obsessive compulsive behaviour, severe mood swings, irritability, feeling criticised all the time. As much as I try to take the load off of her and give her time to recuperate, she insists on doing caregiving duties, sometimes in excess and to little effectiveness. This morning she forgot to give my dad his medication (it was only an hour late), but it seemed to trigger a spiral of controlling behaviour. 

My Sister recently developed a fear of choking and swallowing that I surmise has stemmed from the intense stress and anxiety of this time. In the past couple of weeks she has had to slowly eat one long meal a day composed of very soft foods. She‚Äôs even had to supplement her diet with the nutritional drinks my dad is supposed to take. We have gotten her throat checked out (fine) and arranged for psych and Counselling services. She however, seems to lack initiative, and drags her feet on calling numbers and even taking her medication (she recently developed an upper respiratory tract infection). 

My mum is spiralling because now both my Sister and my dad are ill - my dad with his terminal illness and pneumonia complication, my sis with her anxiety and it‚Äôs manifestation, as well as her recent infection. She reacts to this by being intrusive and controlling, berating my Sister, becomes reactive to the sound of her coughing in her room, emotionally dumping on me all the time (even when I draw a line - she doesn‚Äôt hear it / she can only hear the din of her chaotic emotions), randomly and dramatically doing things like fishing out a weighing scale and asking me if it‚Äôs a good thing to get my Sister to see her weight right now (as though it will ‚Äúscare her‚Äù into doing... what exactly? Eating more? She‚Äôs already improving in her intake...) just last night things got so bad I had to pass her a counselling emergency helpline to call. It seemed to calm her down. This morning it‚Äôs like the conversation never happened and she began doing all those things again. I‚Äôm not sure exactly what brought it on other than a sense of lack of control when she forgot my farher‚Äôs medication ‚Äî it‚Äôs like her world sifts dramatically all the time. I suspect my mum has had undiagnosed and untreated mental health issues on top of her caregiver stress, and the combination is not pretty. It actually makes recovery and healing at home very disruptive and disorganised. Before my dad‚Äôs most recent prognosis, this tended to be the dynamic in the family too. Home was a contradictory mix of safety, imagination, love, high emotionality, outbursts, stress, intrusive behaviour and poor boundaries. In the past this has escalated into some very bad periods, including a time when my mum pressured my sister to give up a place as a very prestigious university when she showed adjustment issues, to study locally instead; it seemed that she did that to ‚Äúresolve‚Äù the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù and minimise the stress in her vicinity. Growing up, this lead me to engage in pleasing behaviours and complete tearaway behaviour when I wanted to get away from feeling engulfed by the family (it also resulted in feeling extreme guilt in not spending more time with my dad, which comes and goes).

I‚Äôm trying my best to arrange schedules, deal with my dad and sis in a calmer, more persuasive way. I‚Äôve been seeing a counsellor since July as I realised I needed help during this time. This counsellor made me much more aware of some of the consequences of the highly involved / poor boundary dynamic my family has. My mum doesn‚Äôt seem to realise that one of the main things she has to deal with at the moment is her mental health. Some advice will be appreciated. At the moment I do not know what to do besides taking over caregiving duties myself and getting a nurse to do home visits to help. However, my mum‚Äôs mental instability, and the legacy of that in my family (in me and my Sister) still remains an issue. Thanks a lot.

Heading to the end,5,j6qold,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/j6qold/heading_to_the_end/,2,1602105608.0,"My dad was diagnosed a little over two years ago with Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer. He has been fighting the good fight ever since. He started the most aggressive form of chemo, folfirinox, which we saw almost immediate results. His cancer markers went down but not without lots of hardship. The first few months he lost a significant amount of weight, his hair all fell out, he was sick most of the time and slept more than he was awake. Thankfully, he has an amazing oncologist who was able to adjust his dose and after some trial and error they found a regime that provided quality of life and also fought the cancer. His markers went down to under 100 and he was feeling great. He even traveled across the country to visit me. 

That was two years ago. 

The last month has been incredibly difficult. Essentially the cancer mutated and stop responding to the treatment. His markers are so high that they can't even be measured (over 20,000).  He has been experiencing horrible pain in his legs and hips but the doctor has no idea from what. This week he got a PET scan which actually showed the tumors are stable and the scan looks better than the original but the numbers are so high they don't know what to do. They are scheduling a MRI to check if there is some sort of nerve issue unrelated to the cancer or if in fact it is a weird side effect of the chemo or cancer itself. He lives in Colorado so he is able to treat pain with CBD and THC is on a very specific treatment plan involving RSOs as an alternative form of treatment and pain management. Our oncologist is starting to lose hope, in his last appointment I could tell he was trying everything to avoid saying hospice. 

I work freelance so luckily I am able to pick up and leave to go home to be with my family and help my parents. I want to get some time with him before it gets worse. We are hoping that if we continue with the current chemo and figure out what is causing the pain we can get him back on track. I feel half hopeful and half in complete despair. I love my dad and I don't want to lose him. I also don't want to watch him be in so much pain. I was looking from photos from before his treatment and he is a different person, to be honest everyone is my family is a different person. Not to be selfish but this has been incredibly hard on the rest of the family too. I live across the country without a partner working on my career trying to move that forward while having this in the back of my mind dictating every decision I make in case I have to quit and leave early. I have been lucky enough that I can travel home quite often and be there for most of the important things. But I am so exhausted, my family is so exhausted, my dad is so exhausted. I just want him to be cured but I know that won't happen. I feel like there is nowhere to turn, hence why I posted here. My friends are not yet at the point in their lives where they have lost a parent so it feels so isolating. I just needed to get some of this out and this seemed like the place so thank you.

My father was a fighter and a hero to me. He was diagnosed with Liposarcoma 5 years ago and has never stopped fighting until today. He went through 4 surgeries to remove 7 tumors over the last five years. His cancer was so aggressive that the doctors recommended he go on a trial, which only made my dad suffer. The trial was unsuccessful and by then the growth rate of the tumors had multiplied to 160%. My father had been in the hospital for the past week due to the rate of growth in the tumors he currently had. He did not want to have my mom, brother and myself watch him suffer. As my mom walked out of the hospital room to use the phone to check in on me, he passed. He did not want to be resuscitated and could not handle the pain anymore. My brother and I came to see him after his passing at the hospital because they would only let my mom in before he passed. That was my first time seeing a human being dead. It was gut wrenching to see my father like that but we all knew he was finally out of the pain he had been struggling recently and for the last 5 years.",2020-10-03 15:06:56

She will have a biopsy next week and a PET scan right after, but we already know she has a spot on her kidney and sternum.  He said if it has not spread, it would be considered stage 3.

"[venting] covid, my dad's cancer",5,ima060,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/ima060/venting_covid_my_dads_cancer/,2,1599225216.0,"This is gonna be a rant and I felt like I needed to share it somewhere.

Anyway, this is the story of my Grubhub fiasco today, COVID, my parents and cancer, and me trying to handle stressful situations. It starts with my parents; they're terrified of COVID. They're both cancer survivors in their late 60s/early 70s who are constantly vigilant and afraid of germs, even before COVID. Then COVID comes and their world shrinks. I abandon my apartment across the state to stay with them back in March so I could help out around the house during COVID. March passes as we start adapting to the life at home. Then April comes and my dad discovers he has a new form of lymphoma, potentially more severe than his leukemia 11 years ago. So he starts a 15-week intensive chemotherapy treatment. Meanwhile I'm staying with them, working a full-time job from their house, and trying to provide emotional support and caretaking as much as I can.

The last few months were just overwhelming, with so many challenges that I won't get into here. The hardest of it all was dealing with the reality of my dad's mortality. I was 9 years old when my mom first got cancer, then 19 years old when my dad got leukemia, and now I'm 30. When I was younger I couldn't grasp the magnitude or the reality of their cancer diagnoses; part of me just had this naive, impenetrable hope that everything would work out -- that it had to work out because I needed it to. Then this time around I started facing all the realities: the reality that my dad might die soon, that my mom might be left alone in a big house without friends or family nearby, and that my younger sister, halfway across the country will be devastated. Memories came flooding back of my childhood, especially the depression I suffered during my dad's first cancer treatment because it was too much for me to process. At the same time I'm now going to therapy after the dissolution of my 5 year relationship. I cried so much these last few months and mustered all my energy to try to be strong enough so I could support my parents.

Then two weeks ago we finally get good news. My dad had a PET scan and there's no remaining sign of his tumor -- it's the best possible result from his treatment. It's felt like a huge relief for everyone, and my dad's energy is returning. We don't know what the future holds but we finally had this victory after months of challenging times. Which brings us to today, and this stupid Grubhub story.

Since March, my parents have home-cooked every meal because they're terrified of COVID. My mom dislikes cooking and my dad is too exhausted to make anything for himself, so I try to cook some tasty food for them. Finally this week I asked my dad if he's up for delivery/takeout sometime. I could tell it brought up anxiety for him, but I felt like everyone was craving takeout after eating the same home-cooked food for 5 months straight. So today I order Grubhub for the first time and we excitedly all want mole enchiladas from our favorite mexican restaurant. The food delivery arrives, then two minutes later I open up the bags and find that over half of my order is missing. I spend the next 30 minutes on Grubhub customer support, texting the delivery driver, calling the restaurant, arguing to get a refund because Grubhub is trying to nickel-and-dime me. Meanwhile my parents are getting stressed out because I'm angry. I finally reorder more food from the restaurant and drive 30 minutes to pick up the food. Then I tell the waitress how frustrated I was with this, but she's young and she can't understand why this dinner means so much to me. And I don't want to have a long conversation with strangers due to COVID.

I get home, eat my mole enchilada, and then start sobbing in my room trying to figure out why I got so emotional about this stupid Grubhub issue. I just wanted this to go smoothly, to show my parents that it's OK to order takeout or delivery sometimes, that the world is adjusting to COVID and that things are alright. Looking back, this one dinner wasn't a big deal but it brought up all these feelings from the last 5 months.

If you made it this far, then thanks for reading. My heart goes out to everyone dealing with cancer or other illnesses during this time. I just felt like I had to write up my story because it's been bubbling inside me. With Love - C",2020-09-04 13:13:36

So in early June he was rushed to the hospital, he had a perforated colon. Surgery removed a section of colon, he got what is supposed to be a temporary colostomy bag. It was discovered during surgery that he had colon cancer. The tumor was completely removed by the surgery. Tests showed that some stray cancer cells remained in his body, som chemo was scheduled. The plan has been to go through 12 chemo sessions, then he could have his colon reconnected and lose the colostomy bag. The oncologist has told him numerous times how lucky he was that the tumor was removed, and that the chemotherapy is to try to eradicate the trace amount of cells left over. In fact, his chemo is considered a really light chemo - minimal side effects, no expected nausea, no expected hair loss. All in all, I would think millions of cancer patients would love to be as set up for success as he is. 

He had his first session 2 weeks ago and was perfectly fine through it, absolutely no side effects. He has been really positive and upbeat about it all looking forward to breezing through and losing the colostomy bag. Today is supposed to be session 2, but his blood test yesterday showed his white blood cell count was a little too low and that they'd need to bring that back up before chemo can resume. That sent him completely into an angry rage and is calling up all the medical team saying he wants to quit. He says he isn't going to deal with any setbacks, even minor ones, and if there are factors that can cause unexpected delays, he'd rather just die from cancer than to deal with what he now considers ""being jerked around"". 


This is completely irrational to watch, and I don't know how to calm him down and see the big picture. His attitude literally flipped a 180 at the drop of a hat.",2020-08-20 01:00:36

i just feel i don't want to be in contact with anyone...i think because i feel upset they don't understand my concerns, though almost impossible for them to do... for instance, i am concerned about being left in my home, after my mothers death, to live alone for a few months (possibly as i sell the house and relocate) and without much outside contact or support from my blood family. my blood family has shown me little emotional support so far and they are the only ones living near me where i am with my mother. i am afraid of the mental toll it will take on me from thereon...and how i will resurface or recover alone, without the physical presence or encouragement of others. the task to overcome and reorder my life on my own felt so daunting a day ago, i heavily considered suicide to be the only release from intense mental pain; i'm attempting to set up a therapist appointment by the end of the month to address my desired disconnection and further alienation from people who care about me, and are attempting to be there for me in some form, but feel failed by...

have you felt this anger towards outsider's obliviousness? i'm not sure how to work with it. i think i have had a history of disowning friends suddenly, i want to work on this with a therapist too, but i just really feel almost nothing/indifference to these friends i loved DEARLY months earlier. i don't really know what to do with those feelings as i almost want to cut contact. i DO think it's important to have relationships and support is so, so important. but i don't feel supported by them, and i don't feel necessarily that they can support me, in whatever way i am subconsciously desiring.

Having a hard time to cope with the distance.",6,i2935b,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/i2935b/my_m31_dad_m60_was_diagnosed_with_stage_4/,3,1596387554.0,"Hi Everyone.

I apologize in advance for what might become quite the wall of text, for any mistakes (as English isn't my native language) and for the possible rambling.

I've put a **TLDR;** at the bottom as well, just in case this turns out a bit too confusion.

Just to give a bit of a background- My dad currently lives in the states (After emigrating in his mid 20's from the states to where I currently live, marrying twice, having me from the first marriage, divorcing and then 3 other kids from his 2nd marriage \[All pre to mid teens now\], and emigrating back to the states after living here for around 30 years), I was born & raised here and at the time of his return to the states (around 6 years ago) I've already built a life & a career for my self here which is why I stayed here.

After his diagnosis this past September, during which he was also diagnosed as pre-diabetic. My Fiancee( now wife) and I booked flights and visited him and the rest of the family for two weeks around December.

Up until that point he's had a biopsy for the initial diagnosis (Which was taken from his back), and right before our visit he had another biopsy to check his lymph nodes which sadly came back positive.

During our visit my dad was just starting his immunology treatments, and was working from home. Other than the fact he lost some weight (Due to his dietary changes to avoid his pre-diabetic state) he seemed in relatively good shape, even if he seemed a bit down emotionally speaking.

We spent our visit helping his wife with her business (She runs a boutique bakery from home), spent some quality time with my siblings and brought them all some much needed breathing room.

After returning from our visit we've tried to stay in touch as much as possible, plans were made and approved with the doctors to make sure the treatments were scheduled around our wedding (Which was held this June) so they all could come over and attend in between the treatments.

Then Covid hit here around Mid-March ,and with that the hopes of seeing them for the wedding.

Around April, after another routine check, the doctors did yet another biopsy and discovered that the tumor spread to his liver, and that apparently he has another simultaneous, non malignant cancer in his bladder, which is unrelated to melanoma.

Putting aside the fact the wedding planning was hard on us as it is due to the uncertainty brought by Covid,living with the fact my dad was going through immunology treatments which weren't really doing much and his deterioration felt like too much to handle.

Luckily, me and my SO managed to hold the wedding without too much trouble, with my dad and the rest of the family on conference call for the duration of the ceremony, which was quite bitter sweet for everyone involved.

I feel like this has already gotten quite rambly and long, but basically his Melanoma as of now has already spread past his initial tumor on his back, onto his lymph nodes, liver and now bones.

This past weekend I've received an update from his wife that he's had severe abdominal pains, and was rushed to the ER, his scans showed that his Liver is now twice its size, he's been on an induced coma since then to ease his suffering and perform any required tests to try and stabilize his condition.

Up until Covid hit, I've managed to draw inspiration from a lot of sources, here included, from people dealing with sick parents both close to them and overseas, but I feel that because of the pandemic the situation has just gotten much more difficult for me to handle mentally, mostly because I'm helpless and can't do anything.

I'm very lucky to have my SO and my close friends to be here for me and support me, but this situation feels so extreme because of the distance and the pandemic and I am honestly having a hard time to cope with all of it.

**TLDR;** My dad is battling stage 4 Melanoma that's spreading and is currently in an induced coma on the other side of the globe. I'm having a hard time to cope with not only the distance but also the feeling of helplessness due to the fact Covid has pretty much shut down any hopes of my flying there to be with my family and say goodbye.

I guess I'm just looking to vent, and hopefully maybe find some words of encouragement, words of wisdom or anything to help with coping as it just feels overwhelming.",2020-08-02 16:59:14

I hate that I‚Äôm having to post this but I‚Äôm hoping for some support. This is a bit of back story and the even that happened today. 

A very close family member of mine was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer-a Glioblastoma. It was promptly removed and chemo and radiation done. We have already passed the anticipated death day if we hadn‚Äôt done any treatment. 

This person is my angel. I love them so much. When I heard the news I was broken. I sobbed and raged for 24 hours. Couldn‚Äôt sleep... forgot to breathe even. 

Today I was at my beautiful mom‚Äôs house. She asked me for a favour and said she couldn‚Äôt do it herself. I agreed enthusiastically thinking it was help with her cat‚Äôs nail trim or something. She handed me a box.

Mom: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs heavy isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù
Me:‚ÄùUh yes it is.... what is it‚Äù 
*I see the label on the box just as she tells me* 
Mom: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an urn... for (family member).

I immediately started crying. I opened the box and it was beautiful I guess. Purple petal like detailing with silver trim I guess that had like vine detailing engraved. She told me part of our family member will go in there and when my mom dies, she wants me to put her in there. I guess if I get cremated I‚Äôll do the same. She said then we‚Äôd be together forever (cue more ugly sobs). 

I was surprised as she is taking it extremely hard and when my pet died she couldn‚Äôt even look at photos. But she was so brave and strong.

My(24f) dad(66M) has Stage 4 metastatic colorectal cancer. Although some tests are still going on, most tests are done. 

After his colonoscopy and and Ileostoma, the doctors sent us home so he could recover from his surgery and get physically stronger. In about two weeks, they want to start chemo.

His doctors talked to me and let me know that his illness is non-curative and  they can only give him palliative care. 

My mom and dad do not know. I don't know if I should tell them or keep it from them. My cousin thinks that knowing that its uncurable could have them both give up way before the treatments even start. I think that knowing the truth helps them temper their expectations from the chemo and they kinda know what they're in for. I am confused and divided about what to do.

So, should I tell a dying man that it might be his last few months or should I keep it from him and make him fight a battle that we have already lost?",2020-06-25 22:00:12

How do you deal with the emotional exhaustion of caring for an elderly person with cancer?,6,guvpet,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/guvpet/how_do_you_deal_with_the_emotional_exhaustion_of/,3,1591082973.0,"My 81yo mom was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer last summer. She's had an operation, chemo and most recently radiation/chemo and is now trying to recover. However she's so weak and literally all she does is go from a bed to a recliner to bed and eats a tiny bit every day. We can have normal conversations much of the time but mainly at night when she's getting ready for bed and in the morning when she's getting up, she's full of despair.

She moans and sometime screams and buries her head in her hands, and just seems to give up. She says it not so much the pain but the extreme exhaustion. But she also switches from a normal voice to this despairing one at the drop of a hat. 

I live across country from her and am here for two weeks but my dad, who is 85, is her main caregiver. It's overwhelming for him, especially when she wails and also blames him  for everything.

Because of the coronavirus, at this moment, it appears I can't get anyone to come in to help care for her on a regular basis, nor can we find a place (assisted living) that will take her now because of Covid. 

Anyway, anyone else deal with this? It's so hard to be the strong emotional one day after day. I mean, if I were here full-time, I could do it. But my dad doesn't have the compassion, patience or just all-around presence to be a source of comfort to her when she most needs it.

This morning I got a call from my grandmother... as the title says, she has stage 4 cancer and it wasn‚Äôt caught until this week. We‚Äôre not sure how long she has. The doctor said maybe 6 months, but she‚Äôs declining quickly.
She lives in a different state from me and I haven‚Äôt seen her in over 6 months. We‚Äôre extremely close and have been for my entire life. I love her with all my heart and when I think of disaster, I think of losing her.

She‚Äôs handling it with the same incredible grace she‚Äôs always handled these things. She‚Äôs only focused on comforting me and our family, but I‚Äôm not sure what to do for her. I wish I could see her. We‚Äôre planning to fly over to visit as soon as possible, but with Covid there‚Äôs a chance that the hospital she‚Äôs being admitted to won‚Äôt allow her to have more than two visitors.

I feel directionless. I want to be there with her, but she says it‚Äôs okay because we both love each other. I‚Äôve only lost one other person this close to me while being old enough to process it. That was her husband, my grandfather, whom I was also incredibly close with. He passed away from natural causes over 6 years ago. It feels like much less.

I‚Äôve never lost someone to cancer before, except a family friend a few months ago. I can‚Äôt imagine a world without my grandmother. I feel like in my head, I‚Äôm thinking very clearly, but my body just keeps crying in bed. I don‚Äôt know what to do.
All I can really take to heart right now is everything she‚Äôs telling me, that it‚Äôs okay and she‚Äôs at peace.

I‚Äôm not sure how to mourn, either. It feels like I‚Äôm mourning now, but I haven‚Äôt lost her. She might be here as late as Halloween. I can‚Äôt possibly know what it‚Äôs going to be like when I‚Äôm no longer able to call and text her whenever either of us wants to.",2020-05-28 06:17:40

But we know that it is inevitable.

My question is: How do I tell my friends and loved ones about this?? I feel I should, but I don't know how. And with qurantine still going on in my country for a long time I think I'll only be only to tell them by videocall, but I don't know if it's gonna be the best, cause they can't contain me and it's gonna be awkward to start to cry in front of them alone in my room while they stare in the camera.

She just seems to be on a mission to take us down with her? She constantly makes us feel shitty and belittle us because she feels crappy, she loses her temper and used her sickness to make herself the victim..and the worst part is she uses her dying to manipulate us and make us feel awful. ‚ÄúOh don‚Äôt worry I know you‚Äôll have peace when I die soon‚Äù I suffer from depression, I almost failed out of Engg school because i was in such a deep hole.
It sucks because it‚Äôs this constant battle of ‚Äúfuck that I don‚Äôt deserve that‚Äù and ‚Äúfuck, I know she‚Äôs sick and gotta be patient‚Äù but..am I crazy to think she can‚Äôt just use her sickness to manipulate me emotionally? As far as I know, I don‚Äôt think she actually feels like she‚Äôs going to die soon. She‚Äôs always planning and doing things about the future..so I don‚Äôt know. I hate this battle in my head. She has always had a way to totally just emotionally unbalance me. I love my mom
And she‚Äôs amazing, but fuck this sickness and just fuck this shit. 
I am thankful because I have worked sooo incredibly hard and I don‚Äôt feel in this massive hole anymore. It‚Äôs still incredibly incredibly hard, just never know what mom I‚Äôm going to get. And she doesn‚Äôt see it she doesnt get it, and she won‚Äôt get any help. In her eyes, she can‚Äôt talk, she can‚Äôt do anything because she‚Äôs so awful..again just the victim. 

Sigh I‚Äôm just sick and tired of the emotional manipulation. I‚Äôve tried talking to her about it but obviously hasn‚Äôt gone well. Mom is incredibly stubborn even before this happened so, I don‚Äôt know. 

My aunts husband died from cancer a few years ago and I talk to her and my cousin a lot. They just say it‚Äôs the sickness and it‚Äôs what happens.

He was told in 2012 he was in 4 stage bladder cancer. He did chem/rad and after few years was in full remission. He's been getting worse. He's so tired he's never hungry when he eats it's only sweets to be honest he smokes cannabis to combat cancer symptoms but now when he does he pass out/falls asleep and he starts convulsing/shaking i haven't seen this happen in person as I'm trying to stay away so i don't get him sick this is what my grandmother has relayed to me he said he won't do chem/rad again nor will he have to use a pee bag(sorry I don't know Technical name) he is overweight and has copd I'm not sure if he can even have surgery but im just wondering can I give him my bladder I will use bag I don't care I just can't be here without my grandfather i literally have 0 friends except my 2 kitties my grandpa is my best friend I need him to be here to see me get my life together it is not possible then what can I do to help him also what could be causing the seizure like behavior that's happening what do I need to know to expect in these coming days any advice would be greatly appreciated I've tried researching what I could but my mind is so foggy it's hard to think tI want to thank anyone in advance who takes time to read this and for any helpful comments I may get.

Fast forward to this past December and they found out her liver is blocked and her cancer has come back but strong it's now back in her liver (she only has half) in her lungs and I'm unsure where else. Anyway as of last night she is starting in on liver failure and my father in law is acting like nothing is happening :/. I don't know how to help him accept what's going on. He's just denying it all and we know she is holding on because of him . My husband isn't super close to his father do we are unsure how to approach this situation and help him greive.

I would just like to share my story so far, and hopefully find some people who can relate. I am currently a freshman at college, living out of state and about 3 hrs from home. Around 4 weeks ago my dad called me and told me about the cancer. Bile duct, to be exact. It wasnt too much of a surprise as we had known this had been a possibility for months but still, it shocked me just as much as if i hadnt known the news was impending. My dad and I are extremely close, and Ive been calling every day for updates. He is being treated in Minneapolis (about a four hour flight from home)by very good doctors, and tomorrow will be the first time ive seen him all semester, and the last time i will be able to see him before he flies out there for treatment. Tomorrow also, we will find out whether the cancer has reached his lymph nodes or not. I dont have many friends here, and all of my family is so far away. its been very difficult not having anyone really to talk to, or for support. Ive begun to think about temporarily dropping out of school, depending on the results tomorrow. i cant stand being so far away from him and home and my siblings and mom.  Its so hard to process, and ive never been so scared and depressed in my life.

So may dad has been fighting cancer for a few years now, his first being penile cancer, then lymph nodes, now it's in his liver and bones.

I don't want to be really involved because I don't want my last memories of my dad of him suffering and unable to be independent of anything.

I don't really know, even now as my mom going to be talking with a hospice nurse, how to comprehend the whole situation. I know it's bad, and it's hard for my mom, and obviously my dad, but I've just been attack from the rest of my family for not quitting my job and moving back in with my parents to be with my dad.

I remember the day she told me the cancer progressed to stage III. After double nephrostomy surgery, she looked up at me from her hospital bed with determination and said, ""I will fight with everything I've got."" That was about a year ago. Now the cancer is stage IVb and is widespread in her abdomen.

She gave it all of her will, and dutifully took life extending treatments, remaining positive but wearing down a little more each time. She stopped being able to join us for holidays and birthdays. Then she stopped being able to sit up for long periods. Now she's all but stopped eating and hardly has the energy to talk. My family is trying to push food on her whenever they can, but I don't think they understand that she probably can't digest food the same way anymore.

She is slowly wasting away. As thin as any living human ever was. I don't think she has very long left. I'm trying to spend time with her when she can tolerate company and help to care for and pamper her just a little.

I keep getting the urge to call her in panic. I know that won't help her for me to panic. So I only call every few days and just swallow the existential dread in between. I try not to think about how her very cells are damaged and diseased beyond repair. 

 I'm not the only one panicking- my grandmother, dad, and sister are all freaking out in their own individual ways. My dad dug up the entire landscaping and sprinkler system on his property by hand.

I went to see him this week-end and I talked this morning to one of his doctors.

Cancer is taking my Dad from me..,5,e37oer,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/e37oer/cancer_is_taking_my_dad_from_me/,18,1575020304.0,"It's been almost a year since my Dad was diagnosed with Stage 4 Colon Cancer that metastasized to his Liver, and it's been a tough year for him mentally and physically. 

It all started when my Dad and stepmom noticed a 'knot' underneath his right rib. Went to his GP and she sent him to a Gastrointestinal Specialist to check him out. The first visit they just did xrays and was told that he had tumors covering his left and right lobes on his liver. This man, who was just the nurse because the actual Dr wasn't there, basically told us that it was useless, that nothing would help him. Worst News Ever..üòü
We then made an appointment with his now Oncologist, who is amazing by the way, and he said he wouldn't be able to tell us anything without a colonoscopy and a liver biopsy done. The colonoscopy showed a 6cm 'mass', Cancer, 3cm inside his rectum and the liver biopsy did indeed show Cancer. Dads Oncologist told him this news and it broke my heart because my Dad doesn't deserve this horrible disease. The Oncologist, Dr Boniol, told us that without any chemo treatment, he had maybe 3 months to live. This wasn't an option for me. Chemo and Radiation it is. Even Worse News..üò•
Dad had an appointment the same day as the colonoscopy to get his Port Placement done. While he was in surgery for that, I walked to the Cancer Center, which is in the same hospital area, and made his appointment for his first round of Chemo. While making the appointment at the Cancer Center I was told insurance hasn't approved treatment yet, so the nurse called Boniol. This great Dr told the nurse to go ahead and schedule the appointment, without insurance approval, because he knows without it my Dad won't make it. Best Dr Ever..üíôüíö
Chemo first: 12 rounds of FOLFOX and 10 rounds of Avastin is the Chemo he will have. Besides the neuropathy and occasional nausea he was doing great, until his 9th FOLFOX/7th Avastin. He wasn't feeling good and was having trouble swallowing. Dad was taken to the ER because we was scared of something going wrong, boy were we right! His blood sugar was 867 when he was admitted into the hospital and extremely close to, well nothing good. Boniol said the Avastin can sometimes bring out diabetes in someone that already has a mild case of it, we had no idea. Dad was very lucky to be alive on this day. So he now has Colon/Liver Cancer and Diabetes. WTF!!üò§
Fast forward to Dad finishing the FOLFOX/Avastin Chemo treatments. He gets his first scan done after Chemo and they show that the Chemo has indeed worked on the Colon Cancer. üëç
Up next will be Sirtex Radiation Beads to treat his Liver Cancer. This will only be 2 rounds of this treatment, one round for each lobe. The Sirtex Beads will be injected directly into his liver, instead of throughout his whole body, and they will then stick to the Cancer and fight it. The 1st treatment went real good for Dad. I mean, he was really low on energy for about a week after but he evened out around the 2nd week. The 2nd treatment hit him worse. His energy level is crazy low and we, my stepmom and I, have noticed that he has started being not as positive at the outcome after all his treatments. He's Scared Now..üò∞
Almost 2 weeks after his 2nd Radiation treatment, he was having bowel issues, memory loss, trouble swallowing food and he's lost tons of muscle in his body. My stepmom and I took him to the ER and the CT Scan showed 2 spots on his brain and that means, within the past week or so, Dad had a Stroke. He has no idea when he had the Stroke, so we're thinking it happened in his sleep. Which scares all of us because that means he's lucky he even woke up from it.. What's Next..üò©
Since the Stroke happened Dad has been an emotional wreck. When anyone tells him that they love him, he gets tears in his eyes. He's scared to death of what's happening to him, I can see it in his eyes. My stepmom and I have been to each and every Dr appointment since this started and we are constantly telling him that it's okay to be scared, because it's the unknown. He has no idea what all this will end up becoming and it scares the shit out of him. ü§Ø
All the family has repeatedly told him that we are all here for him, for no matter what he needs/wants and not to be scared to talk to any of us, to which he usually replies that he doesn't wanna be a bother to anyone. We have all been trying to assure him that he is no bother at all and that we will all be there for him, even if he doesn't want us to help.üòå
Dad told me today that he's glad that I, his only daughter, has been there to help him and my stepmom from the beginning. Said he doesn't want to think of where he'd be if I wasn't there to help them both throughout all of this disease. I told him that he took care of me growing up and that it was my turn to help take care of him.üò•
Even after me reassuring him again that he is no bother at all to me if he needs anything from me. This is my Dad and he has been a great Dad. If there is anything I can do to make him forget for a moment about his situation, I will. If there is anything I can do to make sure he knows that I'm not going anywhere, I will. This man is my rock and I will be forever grateful that he was chosen to be my Dad. I will love him forever and will make sure he knows how much I love him forever!üíó
Thanks to anyone to reads my families Cancer story and if anyone has any advice on what I can do to help my Dad, please let me know. I appreciate any help to help my Dad.

I even cleaned the house and prepared a bedroom for her downstairs just Incase the day comes she can‚Äôt make it up the stairs anymore. Well she came home and yelled at me for changing everything (only 2 rooms we almost never use were affected. It‚Äôs just us 2 in a 6 bedroom home) I feel like nothing I do is appreciated. Up until about October 2019 my mom always cooked for me and once she became too weak I taught myself how to cook and I actually enjoy it but anyway she yelled at me bc I didn‚Äôt cook the rice I was planning to eat the way she wanted me to. She didn‚Äôt want to eat the rice because she already had food someone brought her but still wanted to criticize my cooking method. It tasted fine btw. I just feel exhausted and I am back to crying everyday on my way home from work bc living with her is so stressful. Any advice is welcome.,2019-11-29 00:23:08

My Dad has recently been treated for advanced prostate cancer. The chemo was successful in clearing the metastasized bits and hormone therapy is suppressing the original tumour. He has check ups every three months to monitor the situation. 

As part of the most recent check up (which gave us the great news about the successful chemo), he was given a colonoscopy as a routine test, but the results hadn't come back in time for the appointment so we've been waiting for them for a week or so. The doctors weren't expecting any bad news and so my parents went on a short holiday to celebrate him getting through the last year. 

They come back in the early hours on Sunday. Today (Friday) I got a call from the colo-rectal department  people at the hospital and I have to pass on to my dad that they want to run more tests. Obviously this is essential information that he needs to know, but morally I'm conflicted. He is happy and enjoying his holiday. All the weight is off his shoulders. Telling him now would make the last day of his trip incredibly stressful. 

Is it okay to wait for him to get back to give him this news? If things are bad, and I am terrified that they are because if everything was fine they wouldn't want more tests, then he might be in for another year of difficulty and pain and sickness. Having the memory of this blissful holiday might make it easier to endure what's coming. But keeping it from him, even for such a short time, feels wrong too. It's his medical condition and his body and he should know.

My mother said she's fine with doctors not helping her if her heart gives up,7,c5pv0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/c5pv0g/my_mother_said_shes_fine_with_doctors_not_helping/,8,1561584717.0,"I'm (21f) currently hiding in the bathroom in our hospital room trying to not cry again. I know it's her choice. I know I'm selfish. But she's my mother. She's the most important person in my life. I can't live without her. I don't want to. It kills me to see her in pain, but to not see her at all? I can't do that. We need her. We need her strong and healthy. What if they helped her and she's fine afterwards? Why can't that be the situation? 

They said the same abour her coming to intensive care, but she's in pain either way. That's not okay. 

Last week they send us away saying that they can't help her and now we're back. I don't know. I can't talk to ger without her getting upsad at me for being upset. I can't talk to my brother's or father without them yelling at me for being upset, or because I don't ""care for her correctly"". When people come to visit her (like.her friends) they yell at me. For example she asked me to hand her her favourite parfum, because she missed the smell. I handed her parfum and everyone ganged up on me and called me all the names you can immagine. They than kicked me out of the hospital room till they were done visiting her. 
My mother talked with a nutritionist and I told the nutritionist that many people got in her head with things that she shouldn't eat (anything with sugar, bread, certain fruits and vegetables, any milk products) and that they made her drink and eat the weirdest things. Most of the time she'd starve herself, because they got so in her head about her being responsible for the groth or the cancer and she got scared. The nutritionist proved all of them wrong and told me to make sure that she eats well and showed me what she should eat. I left for work and when I came back I noticed that she didn't want to eat again and that many ""friends"" were visiting her. After I got her something to eat, everyone started to yell at me for following the instructions if the nutritionist (who apparently according to them new nothing). 

My family tells me to keep going to school (fultime), internship and work, but when I leave the house I'm made to feel like the worst human to ever exist. When I stay at home it's also a problem. How dare I use my mother's illness as an excuse to slack of? 
When I go to school, me missing classes is also an issue and every time I prepare for my exam week, something happens and I stay with my mother, because I care about her more than a dumb test. I also just had surgery and that made it impossible for me to leave my house and made it harder for me to help her. This didn't really help the situation at all. I failed this year, obviously, and I'm now officially a waste of space. Seeing as I didn't pass my 3th year of college I'm now seen as the maid of the family. 
But I swear that I tried. I used to wake up, go to my mother's hospitsl appointments, rush to work, work till midnight, and use the evening to work on school only sleeping about 2 hours before doing the same thing over the next day. When I didn't have school or appointments I'd try to catch up on sleep and I'd be woken up by people yelling at me for being useless. 
 I had to make a choice, because everything that I did wasn't done well. I'd give up everything for my mother. If I could take her place I wouldn't even think twice about it. 

I'm just scared and sad and tired and exhausted and over it all.",2019-06-26 21:31:57

Watching my dad lay in a bed and slowly die for the last 6 months is the worst way a person can go out. I have always believed in natural treatments and prevention and have always disagreed with western medicine and their practices. It looks like my dad is literally in hell and I just don‚Äôt know how long a human should do this. It seems like cruel and unusual punishment to me. They‚Äôre saying even if everything goes 100% perfect and he does get better, recovery could be 2 years only to provide him another 3 years tops. Plus some of the issues he is dealing with could be permanent so he is just trading in one sickness for another. Is this worth it!?! Maybe something is wrong with my brain and my perspective, but imagining him going through this for the next few years just does not click in my head. 

Maybe this is the way I was raised or my family dynamic, I don‚Äôt know. I just want to be clear headed and a good person, but my family has never been close. My dad has been single and living alone for a very long time so all he has is the damaged relationships with my brothers and myself. All three of us are there as often as possible and I quit my job to be his full time caregiver... but I can‚Äôt do this job for YEARS. This is AWFUL!!!!! Every day is awful and of course even more awful for my poor father. Does the fact that I‚Äôm not willing to sacrifice years of my life make me a bad person?

She was in remission and it was sudden- we didn‚Äôt get a chance for the big dramatic movie scene of a candlelight vigil by her bed while we say our tearful goodbyes. Her 10 year old daughter found her on the floor before she left for school in the morning. 

My mom was one of her main caregivers since the diagnosis. My sister and her husband had been basically separated for 3 years due to his infidelity (what a gem, right?), he hadn‚Äôt been living at their house and they were two months until the divorce was finalized. My mother is a nurse and had been preparing for this to happen. My father on the other hand was in deep denial that this would ever happen and never wanted to make plans. For him, he not only lost a daughter, but also his best friend. He couldn‚Äôt even look at pictures or talk about it for the first few days until the wake. He is back at work which has helped. 

As we look toward the next few months to years, to the rest of our lives- my brother and I are trying to find the best way to support our parents (while still coping with our own grief). I went on binge cleaning mode at their house for the first three weeks but I am now returning to work (this all happened while on maternity leave- writing at obit at 1am while nursing a 2 month old is not amazing).

My mom‚Äôs experience with cannabis oil,6,bii12m,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/bii12m/my_moms_experience_with_cannabis_oil/,3,1556526152.0,"My mom had/has advanced small cell lung cancer. There was a 7.7cm mass in one lung, spots on her other lung, cancer wrapped around her esophagus, spots around her liver and more spots in her lower back. She was given 6-12 months without treatment and 12-18 with when she was officially diagnosed in June/July of last year. 

She went through 11 rounds of radiation and 6 rounds of chemo and went for a follow up PET scan a couple weeks ago. When she went in for the results, her oncologist was thrilled. She said every area of cancer is gone except the larger tumor that has now shrunk to 1.4cm and is no longer active. She used words like ‚Äúmiraculous‚Äù and said this is ‚Äúmassive.‚Äù She also wanted to know what my mom has been doing outside of the prescribed treatment which leads me to my reason for posting. 

My mom has always been a smoker, both of weed and cigarettes but she quit the cigarettes once this all started. When she was diagnosed, she dove into CBD and THC research and started using Rick Simpson oil. She also cut down her sugar intake and tried to keep her body alkaline. She began making her own RSO and occasionally would vape it but mainly was putting into pill capsules and taking it that way. 

While there is no definitive proof it was the oil, her oncologist said while she can‚Äôt endorse it, she wanted to know all the how/what/when of the oil and told my mom to keep it up. 

Her cancer has a very high return rate and I know this period of clarity isn‚Äôt unheard of so while I‚Äôm absolutely celebrating this victory, I know the future is still very unclear. It‚Äôs just that the way her oncologist spoke was very telling to us-instead of her usual calm and careful choosing of words, she was excited and curious for more information. 

We both have a strong faith and she‚Äôs had a huge group of people praying for her so she credits this entirely to God and the wonderful, healing plant He put on the earth! 

I hope this isn‚Äôt upsetting to anyone, I purely mean it is information and a testament to my mom‚Äôs experience with the oil. I hope it can maybe help someone else!",2019-04-29 08:22:32

My mom has been fighting advanced colon cancer for two years but this is the beginning of the end,5,bgq8ht,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/bgq8ht/my_mom_has_been_fighting_advanced_colon_cancer/,12,1556108324.0,"So two years ago my mom went to the ER because she wasn‚Äôt feeling well. She hadn‚Äôt been feeling 100% for a while and one night she was shivering so hard and even with the fireplace going and a million blankets on her she still felt freezing. They found some spots in her liver and eventually determined it was colon cancer that had spread to her liver. Her liver was covered in spots and she had tumors on her colon, mainly one big one.


She began very aggressive treatment but even from the beginning we knew it was very unlikely she would be cure and the main goal of treatment was to give her more good time. This time last year she found a spot on her lung but she opted to not have it biopsied or taken out. What would be the point if she already has cancer? She did chemo treatment on and off and tried some experimental radiation therapy too where they injected little radioactive pellets (I think?) right into her liver. But since the beginning of this year she lost her insurance and isn‚Äôt eligible for social security benefits so money has been really tight. She‚Äôs just been taking a radiation therapy in pill form. 


Now, last week, she fell outside the chiropractors office. She‚Äôd been having pain in her groin and down her leg for a couple months. She figured it was just a muscle thing because she‚Äôd been pretty low energy and was just laying in her recliner all day. But after the fall she went to the ER and they found a fracture in her femur. She went into surgery the next day to put a pin in her femur to help strengthen the bone and they found a tumor, likely the cause of the fracture. 


My mom has lived two years with this disease and she has remained so strong. We‚Äôve gone on many trips together and she finally fulfilled her dream of buying a motor home. I helped her drive it cross country back home. She‚Äôs so strong and amazing and I can‚Äôt believe this is happening. Her goal from the very beginning was to live long enough to see my youngest sibling graduate high school to make sure they‚Äôd really be okay. They graduate next month so she‚Äôs made it to her goal from the very beginning. With the developments of her cancer she‚Äôs not going to do anymore extensive chemo or treatment. I‚Äôm not even sure if she‚Äôll still take the pill she‚Äôs been taking. She had a blood clot in her leg last year and the doctor gave her the best blood thinner but she doesn‚Äôt take it anymore because she has to inject herself every day. I really can‚Äôt blame her at all. I get it, she‚Äôs tired. I can‚Äôt even imagine what chemo feels like but I can see that it really beats her down. I even told her from the beginning that if she didn‚Äôt want to do treatment I would understand but she basically said ‚Äúhell yeah I‚Äôm doing treatment! I got shit to do!‚Äù 


All her life my mom has served others. She took in kids off the street to help them live better lives. She helped people at church. When I was really young she would take one of our neighbors to her chemo treatments every week and help keep her company. I really can‚Äôt remember her taking baths or going to the spa or doing anything for herself but I remember going with her to volunteering events and working at the soup kitchen for the homeless. I‚Äôve been so depressed and I just feel like this is really truly the beginning of the end. It‚Äôs not a good outlook once it spreads to the bone and especially if she isn‚Äôt doing treatment anymore, I know she‚Äôll be gone very soon. I cried today with my boyfriend then I was okay getting ready for work but once I was alone in my car I started crying again. I went into work and I couldn‚Äôt stop crying so my boss pulled me aside and told me I could take the night off and told me to call her if I need more time. I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm writing this. I just feel so wrecked. I have a really bad headache from crying so hard all day but I hate living my life knowing my mom is dying. She lives 1000 miles away and it‚Äôs hard to take time off work because money and also I feel bad. I don‚Äôt even know why I feel bad but I do. I work a job that you can‚Äôt really pick up the work tomorrow so if I‚Äôm gone then everyone is left short staffed. My managers seem to be very kind and understanding about the situation but I also worry about losing my job for taking time off which is silly because it‚Äôs not even a big career or anything, it‚Äôs just a in a meantime type job. 


I just really feel like my life is crashing. I love my mom, she‚Äôs my best friend. Sometimes I don‚Äôt call her because I want to forget what‚Äôs going on but then I feel bad because I don‚Äôt call. I feel like I need to be there for my siblings and check in with them but I always just feel like I‚Äôm barely struggling to hold myself down, how can I try to support someone else? This post is a mess but I just need to get it all out.",2019-04-24 12:18:44

To start, I‚Äôm only 18, so the thought of my mom dying has never really crossed my mind for the near future. I don‚Äôt really know how to handle the death of a family member because I have no experience in it at all. Anyways.

Three years ago she was diagnosed with  stage 2 colorectal cancer. While it‚Äôs not deadly, I still had to cope with 10 weeks of watching my mother, who inspires me so much, having to go through the most horrifying experiences. The hardest part was that I was 15 and in a brand new school (start of high school). 

Last year, they noticed something on one of her CT scans and thought that it might be cancer, only a different kind. They operated on her leg and removed a lymph node because they thought she had lymphoma. Luckily this time it was fully encapsulated and didn‚Äôt spread to anywhere else, but we kept an eye out.

On Monday, three years after she finished treatments, she had another CT scan and colonoscopy appointment, as they constantly check to make sure that the cancer hasn‚Äôt come back. I was supposed to get the results today (Friday). They were inconclusive. Everything was pretty much fine for the last three years, but even when it wasn‚Äôt at least we had an answer. Inconclusive. I‚Äôm in college now and it‚Äôs 8x more stressful than high school ever was. All I can think about now is the inconclusive results that could turn out to mean another round of chemo and radiation. 

While she hasn‚Äôt been diagnosed again yet, I‚Äôm still hoping that there‚Äôs somebody here that I can at least talk to and vent to. Hopefully all is well, it would take a load off my mind. If anybody has any suggestions with coping mechanisms, especially ones that work with younger people, I‚Äôm honestly open to just about anything at this point. Thanks times a million everyone.

Mom about to start chemo,6,8p44ad,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/8p44ad/mom_about_to_start_chemo/,3,1528345971.0,"I don‚Äôt know where else to write this, I just have a lot to get off my chest and this seems to be a good place. I‚Äôm just filled with a lot of conflicting emotions right now and don‚Äôt know how to feel.

My mom was diagnosed about 2 years ago. Went into the ER for super high blood pressure and we found out she had breast cancer. One of the most frustrating parts of it was that she knew she had a lump, she had felt it, but had kept it to herself not to inconvenience and worry the family for almost a full year prior. Long story short, after tests we got the full diagnosis: stage 4 breast cancer, metastasized, spread to the bones and the lungs.

The first doctor gave her a 2 year prognosis with treatment, including chemo and removal of breast. We looked for a second opinion and took her to City of Hope (a treatment center in Southern California). Everything seemed to be much better. The diagnosis didn‚Äôt change but they put her on hormonal treatment and gave her a shot for her bones. It really did seem to be working well, the liquid in her lungs stopped accumulating, she was responding well to it all. They said that with treatment she was looking at 10 years (mom is in her 60s).

Then the insurance started to screw us over. We‚Äôre low income, and being diagnosed with cancer meant she was disabled so she was getting basic health insurance coverage. Don‚Äôt ask me to explain whether she had Medical or Medicare or what have you because at the end of all of this I still don‚Äôt know and was left even more confused than when we began. 

We had to join a network and I spent a long time on the phone taking time off work to make sure we had the right coverage that would allow her to continue her treatment at City of Hope. The network we ended up with, the representative assured me that CoH was covered under their plan. A month down the line I get a message from CoH saying that they couldn‚Äôt treat my mom because the insurance was refusing to cover her. 

It took me literally several weeks, if not months, spent in the phone with who knows how many reps, to try and get a solid answer. I had to ultimately file a complaint and get the state ombudsman‚Äôs office involved. With a person from the ombudsman‚Äôs office on the other line they had to basically admit that the first rep that had told me CoH was covered had lied to me. Their way out of it was that technically he hadn‚Äôt lied, because if my mom‚Äôs treatment had to absolutely continue at CoH and couldn‚Äôt be done anywhere else then the insurance would cover for it. 

Throughout that two month period of no insurance we had to pay for her shot for her bones out of pocket which would‚Äôve amounted to several thousands of dollars. My mom absolutely refused to have that no matter what. Thankfully and maybe because I had gotten the state involved, we were able to get a really good doctor locally to continue her treatment and it seemed to be going well (or as well as it could go) again. She was even able to travel.

Well, some months ago she went in for a dental appointment and the dentist completely botched the procedure, causing a lot of damage to her jawbone. Nothing unfixable, except it meant she couldn‚Äôt take her shot, so she was in a lot of pain for months on end. Then just a month or so ago, as she was finally getting better to start having her shots again, there were complications with the insurance yet again. I‚Äôm in Canada right now, on the east coast, so my sister has had to deal with a lot of this. She had a doctor‚Äôs appointment with a new doctor and it seems to be pretty bad. They are recommending chemo right away. I had to find out through the phone, with my dad telling me, his voice almost breaking. On top of it all I‚Äôm also worried about him because of his high blood pressure and heart problems. 

Well, I‚Äôm sitting here, in Montreal, miles away, not knowing what to do. I can‚Äôt call my mom or my sister. I can‚Äôt bring myself to talk to them. My sister is a ball of anxiety and stress as is, and my mom acts like nothing‚Äôs wrong. I do know she doesn‚Äôt care about herself one bit and has seen this as an odd wish fulfillment (my mom is an odd woman, her entire life, since I can remember, she‚Äôs talked about not wanting to live past 70, describing that as her greatest fear).  

I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm just rambling at this point. Like I said, I just needed to write this out somewhere. Thanks for reading.",2018-06-07 04:32:51

Struggling with letting my boyfriend in more about my moms terminal cancer,4,jeyzm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/jeyzm7/struggling_with_letting_my_boyfriend_in_more/,4,1603257847.0,"I am struggling with how to let my (23f) boyfriend (25m) in more regarding my moms (57f) terminal illness. I am sorry if this is long, but i feel like I have so much I need to air out and I don‚Äôt know where to turn.

 A little under a year ago my mom was diagnosed with late stage breast cancer. My mom has had cancer twice before in the past decade, but had 4 good and healthy years before this terminal diagnosis. 

Up until early September, my mom had very few symptoms. She maintained a rich social life, walked the dog every day and was mostly feeling herself. It was easy for me to remain positive when my mom was seemingly doing great. But in the last few months her condition has worsened. In the past few weeks especially, she has had severe pain, major loss in appetite and has been basically bedridden. We are awaiting further diagnostics and answers but this a very bad sign that the end may be closer than we anticipated. Her visible symptoms make the nature of her life ending feel way more real which is forcing me to come to terms with things in a bigger way. 

I think I have somewhat accepted the nature of the situation, and I remain somewhat positive. I am super grateful for the 23 years I have had with her, I feel like we had a bond that many people can‚Äôt cultivate in a lifetime. My mom has the best attitude. She lives in the moment, she has an unmatched love for life and appreciation for the little things. It‚Äôs tough to see this side of her fading away in recent weeks. She‚Äôs my biggest fan, and I admire her so much. She and I are best friends. My mom and I have discussed that when she passes we truly will not have anything left unsaid because we understand each other and are bonded on such a deep level.  But that still doesn‚Äôt make what‚Äôs happening any less sad, and I still am experiencing anticipatory grief, helplessness, anxiety and uncertainty. 

For more context on my relationship- my boyfriend and I have been officially dating for 4 months but have a closeness that makes it feel like I‚Äôve known him for a lifetime. We are more in love with each other than either of us has ever been with previous partners. We have spent lots of time with each others friends and families, we talk about everything, and have so much fun in each other‚Äôs company. He makes me feel so loved, we are so comfortable with each other, and I have so much faith in who he is as a person. I trust him immensely. He is genuine, easy to communicate with, humble and emotionally mature. But this doesn‚Äôt change the fact that the relationship is relativity new, even though I truly believe that he is going to be in my life for a long long time. 

My boyfriend is well aware of the situation with my mom. I have explained things in an in-depth way initially, and expressed some of my grievances along the way. But recently as my moms condition has worsened I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôve pushed some of the emotions to the side and tried to throw myself into my social life, my job and my classes. The positivity of falling in love has made it somewhat easy to do so. But this past weekend while with my boyfriend something triggered feelings about my mom in the most unexpected way. I am usually very together with my emotions so it was tough to accept how out of control I felt. I cried in his arms on and off for a few hours while barely being able to say more than a few sentences. I usually do not feel comfortable enough to allow myself to do that with anyone but he gave me a very safe space to feel things out. I still went right to explaining away my emotions, things like ‚ÄúI am sorry I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm like this.‚Äù Or things like, ‚ÄúI think there is so much certainty and that‚Äôs scary‚Äù. But really didn‚Äôt give him much to go off of. I never really fully recovered for the rest of that day. He was immensely supportive. He asked a few questions, comforted me, listened to what I needed, and expressed empathy in such a huge way to the point that he was pretty much tearing up. He held me, gently asked if I wanted to go for a walk or go for ice cream, and showed me some of his favourite songs he listens to when he is sad. When we parted ways the next day I held him close and told him how much I appreciated him, and how I want to talk to him but sometimes it‚Äôs hard. 

He has told me many times if I need someone to talk to that he will be there. I can tell that he wants me to let him in more, and keep him updated on things too. I really want to be able to get into depth with all of the little things I am feeling about this and open up about the messy, intricate details about what my family is going through. But it‚Äôs tough because I feel like that‚Äôs a huge burden to put on someone. I don‚Äôt want him to feel badly because he doesn‚Äôt know the right thing to say. I also have my own baggage that if I let all of this messy stuff out too heavily that it can take away from all of the positive, fun and funny things I like about my personality and make me into someone who is ‚Äútoo much‚Äù. I know this is all in my head but it‚Äôs scary.  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs inappropriate for me to put all of that on him, or if this is better suited for a psychologist. I feel like I really need someone to talk to who isn‚Äôt one of my immediate family members. Being completely vulnerable isn‚Äôt easy. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to or when to approach this with him or handle what I‚Äôm going through? I really want to be able to let him in more but I don‚Äôt know what the healthiest or best thing is for the both of us. I‚Äôve never been this close to anyone I‚Äôve dated so I am not used to this territory. Any words of encouragement or insight would be appreciated so much.",2020-10-21 05:24:07

We don't know how far it's spread or anything, since we were only talking to a chiropractor that has access to my dad's MRI scans (and the scans were strictly only focused on his spine, nothing else).

I'm just wondering if anyone else on here has experience with this type of cancer; so I can figure out what to expect survival wise. I'd especially like to at least get a semi-realistic guess on his chances of surviving this thing. It feels like the chiropractor friend who gave us this heads up may be blowing smoke up our asses a little bit to make us feel better; and I feel like the doctors are going to give us the dark, ""you're going to die from this 100% guaranteed"" version.

Regardless, he has a fracture in his spine and spots on his liver, pancreas and kidney that they are determining today (results in Friday) if they are malignant or not. Friday the has an MRI scan on his brain to check for lesions. At this point, we don't have a stage/grade or idea of treatment. He's been put on morphine and has been stomach sick since. 

I'm at a loss, this came as a crushing blow to my whole family and we are scrambling to do everything we can to fight for and support him.

Recap: my sister has been caring for my dad, he has cancer that spread from his lungs to his stomach and brain, stage 4. He had chemo and/or radiation (he always referred to both) and it didn‚Äôt seem to take. The pills prescribed were for comfort only. 

He ate at first, no much, and my sister would always try to give healthier foods, but it got to the point where she would give him anything he asked for, even if it was unhealthy because otherwise he just wouldn‚Äôt eat). Now, even when he‚Äôs like ‚Äúman I could go for [this]‚Äù and she‚Äôll say ‚Äúok let‚Äôs get it‚Äù hell backtrack and suddenly be like ‚Äúno thank you‚Äù or ‚Äúmaybe tomorrow‚Äù. 

Last time I was there he at least ate a bit, and some stuff he enjoyed (like milkshakes) and regularly went to the bathroom. 

But this week (I just got back home yesterday) we‚Äôd be lucky if he drank a nutrition shake. No matter what she put in front of him - meals, candy, snacks, fruit - he wouldn‚Äôt touch. He very rarely uses the bathroom now. He has a urinal thing so he doesn‚Äôt have to get off the couch as much and possibly fall (he‚Äôd been falling, unless my sister helped him to the bathroom), and I happened to glance at it and his urine is so dark I didn‚Äôt even realize it was that at first. 

I asked him if he wanted to engage the Right To Try laws and try some experimental treatments: nope. He doesn‚Äôt want a nurse, or any sort of outside care especially a hospital, even if my sister and I would love to get an IV in him, he doesn‚Äôt want it and we‚Äôre trying to respect that. But he‚Äôs basically just letting himself die at this pint. 

I just flew home yesterday after staying there a week. My sister texted me today saying that he hasn‚Äôt eaten or drank anything yet, he‚Äôs less coherent and sleeping more, and he asked for me again (he asked for me before too, and even paid for my plane since I haven‚Äôt been able to get a job yet or have time for freelance work). She thinks he knows he‚Äôs going and wants me there. 

It‚Äôs a hassle to keep flying back and forth but I want to BE there for him in his last moments. I can‚Äôt imagine not. Unfortunately it puts stress on my mom and grandma who need help with house things, the dog, etc. 

Everything basically makes me feel guilty and I‚Äôm just breaking down at this point. I don‚Äôt know what to do.",2020-09-17 22:25:16

This will be the first time we've gotten an update on how effective the chemo has been, if it's caused her tumors to shrink. Honestly, I'm scared to death. I've mostly been feeling hopeful before today, but now I feel like I'm going to freak out until her appointment. My mom currently has Stage 4 appendix/renal cancer. I'm not sure exactly which type she has, but it's not hereditary, almost sounds like it was a random fluke where cells began splitting. I'm probably completely butchering the explanation I was told. 

A childhood friend's mom passed away recently from a fairly similar cancer, I believe she was also Stage 4. She struggled for years, had to have part of her colon removed, I honestly can't believe she lived for as long as she did. I'm terrified of the thought of that happening to my mom. The doctors are optimistic, saying that she could be having surgery, having a flush done, and be in recovery within a few months. 

My mom is such a huge part of my life, I don't know how I could live without her. I'm a single mom, my  daughters and I live with my parents.

It's been a very hard few months. Somedays are so bad that I just cry myself to sleep. This was not supposed to happen. My father died 5 years ago at the age of 45(due to cancer) and it was very difficult handling his death, resulting financial difficulties and the resulting distancing from my father's side of the family. These were the people who were a part of my life for the entire first 14 years and then poof. I'm the second youngest on my father's side and none of them could afford a phone call saying I'm sorry and I'll be there for you. It hurt very much. I had to console my brother(10 at that time) and it was harrowing to deal with. This happens just before my 10th grade exams. (Considered huge in India) While I did end up scoring well there were still judgements on how I should've scored higher and used my father's death as an excuse for scoring lower. 

While I haven't even given myself time to heal from that, this shows up. Since then it's only been me figuring out insurance, her medicines, doctor's visits, diagnostic tests. While she being a general physician herself helped, docs don't make good patients. 
My brother and grandmother(68) have been very supportive. We've had to move in with my grandmother and the joint family here.
Most days it's very hard to get by and have to deal with very little privacy/freedoms since we've moved into a hotspot are for COVID. So only hospital visits for chemo and doc consultations. I'm judged on how often I use my phone which is like my only link to the outside world and friends. 
I've lost a lot of important people in my life father, uncle(heart attack not cancer). I haven't yet mourned them properly and then this happens. Sometimes I lose faith in the world that it's putting me through all this. While I understand that my mom's health is the priority, I haven't had time to process this myself and it's been more than 2 months now. We've finished with 4 cycles of chemo each with a 15 day gap. 
There are some days where I just want to give up and leave this world altogether. 
My mom doesn't smoke, drink, eat meat, processed food and even exercises regularly. I have lost all faith in life and myself.

Stage 3 lung cancer,5,i8gym4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/i8gym4/stage_3_lung_cancer/,4,1597278759.0,"Hello, my dad (63) has stage 3 lung cancer (9cm mass). We found out on Easter of this year, and as hard as that was... it's not even comparable to now. Things have gotten so much worse. When he found out, he also had pneumonia and an abscess in his colon. They waited to start chemo until those were taken care of.

He finally started chemo in the beginning of July after the antibiotics and multiple scans. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd is when he went in and by the 7th he was in the hospital. My mom had to call the squad because he couldn't move, couldn't breathe, wasn't eating ect. He was in the hospital for 24 days! With pneumonia 10 times worse than before, ecoli in his bloodstream and the abscess had also grown in size.

He was not in good shape at all. So fast forward those 24 days after surgery (plurX tube), antibiotics, physical therapy, multiple scans ect. (July 31st) he got to come home! They tried putting him in a rehab facility because he couldn't couldnt walk. My mom didnt want that because a rehab facility near us had just had 11 people die from COVID. I drove over an hour to come help, because he is 2 person assist. I've been doing everything I can to help out. He has physical therapy, occupational therapy, a nurse who comes to take his vitals and drains the fluid from his lungs (plurX). 

I guess the point of this post is, I'm worried. His cancer doctor called and said that the chemo is basically what sent him to the hospital. She said that the chemo could kill him faster than the cancer. But without the chemo, he only has 3-6 months... Is there any way this could turn around? Hes doing much better mobility wise. He stood up by himself yesterday. But he also has his reeeeally bad days where he cant breathe, move or even eat.. hes cold all the time and he told me the other day that he could feel the cancer in his chest and it felt like he was drowning...

I hate seeing him like this because hes the type of person who is always up and doing something. As much as all of this makes me sad though, I've been trying to hold all the emotions in, and try to be as strong as I can for my mother, who I know is falling apart on the inside as well. 

Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this. Any advice on how to deal, advice on how to make things easier on him, or just kind words will be very appreciated.",2020-08-13 00:32:39

Finally convinced him and its probably too late to do something as the cancer has already spread so much and its not looking good. 

Less than a month ago my grandfather passed away from covid as well, and my dog of 13 years passed away a month before that. 

I'm only like 18 years old so I'm also trying to take classes, manage internships, help my family and im dealing with all this hardship and I feel like I'm going to explode. 

Covid doesn't help either as classes are so poorly managed and I'm also trying to make a career and do internships and it's extremely stressful. All things considered, I feel like I'm dealing with it decently, but I just don't want to lose my dad. I feel like I didn't get to spend as much time with him as I wanted and I'm just sad he's most likely going to miss out and all the things I want him to be in my life.

He had a stroke five years ago and his life and health has been generally miserable. I mostly feel bad for him more than anything else. He just lost his dad less than a month ago and now his health is rapidly declining. 

I don't really know what the point of posting this was for exactly other than to vent. I have friends, but I just am unsure to open up about this stuff bc I don't want to burden anyone or act like I'm seeking attention. Anyway, congrats if you actually read all this lol.

On Friday her doctor informed her she is cancer free and done with chemo. Instead of being elated, I'm feeling extremely anxious because this means she will be living with me again.

Due to finances, I have been living with my mom for the past few years (the last two I have been attending grad school). I do love my mom but she is VERY needy. Depression, childhood trauma, and two failed marriages have really taken their toll. She sees me as her closest friend still while for years I have felt like the parent in the relationship.

When Covid hit our state, my mom moved in with her mother because I still had to work. It was a blessing as she is a retired nurse and the company was good for both of them. My grandmother is a natural caretaker and was on my mom about exercising, eating, taking meds, etc. Not only do I work full time, but I'm trying to finish my degree. Honestly, I don't know if either my mom or I would have survived lock-down together!

These few months have been the first time in ten years I have not lived with my mother, and it was so nice! We would usually still talk once a day, but I loved the freedom being by myself- no one to explain things to, not having to compromise activities because of someone else, just me and the animals. 

At her last doctor visit, not only was she declared cancer free but they said it was safe for her to return home. I don't know if I even felt a second of joy before the dread hit thinking of her coming home. I am terrified of returning to life with her here and feel like I am headed towards a wall at full speed and there is no steering wheel. I can't move out yet, can't ask her to stay where she is, and this journey hasn't seemed to alter her motivation to build a life for herself.

On top of that anxiety, I feel like a horrible person for not being more excited about her recovery. She beat pancreatic cancer! But I just keep thinking about if things go back to the why they were before she had cancer and it is almost suffocating.",2020-06-10 10:26:45

So they inserted a stent on her to keep the bile flowing. They did a CA19 test on her but it was within the normal range, they were unable to do a biopsy on her because inserting the stent was the bigger priority. We live in the Philippines so a bile duct biopsy is very difficult to get a sample of. The doctor ordered an MRI to be able to get a better imaging but nothing conclusive came out that would indicate cancer however, it's not to be ruled out. Because the scans were inconclusive and the CA19 test was normal, the doctors are debating whether it's inflammatory or cancer and gave us the option of anti TB medication for 2 months in the hopes that it's just a biliary TB. So we have 2 months gambling on anti TB meds, if it doesn't work then it's definitely cancer and this is a rare type of cancer that is Chemo-resistant and surgery doesn't do much better with the odds of survival.

My mother (68) has metastatic breast cancer that has spread to her stomach, liver, and bones. For over two years, she has been kept progression-free and side-effect-free by some amazing at-home chemo pills.

Recently, her pills have failed, and the doctors have put her back on IV chemo at a hospital. She goes 3 times a month, and the oncology team's hope is to keep her progression-free for 6-9 months. After 5 treatments, her cancer markers are dropping, so preliminary results are good.

Emotionally, however, she has take a turn where does not want to be alive anymore and the \*key\* reason for this that she states all the time is that her hair has fallen out from chemo.

She'll say things like, ""I don't care about the stomach problems, all I can think about is how I don't have hair."" Or, ""I've lost my hair and I don't deserve to be alive anymore."" Or, ""I don't want to live if I have to wear a wig."" Or, ""Losing my hair means I'm a failure.""

For the past 2 years, she's been with a therapist who only works with cancer patients, so I'm sure they discuss it during her sessions.

I'm not looking to find a way to change her mind. I'm just dealing with the part where my mother has been given more time on Earth and she very clearly doesn't want to be here anymore and we don't have ""death with dignity"" procedures in our state and I feel like there's nothing we can do to help her enjoy the time she has left before the cancer really starts to kill her.",2020-05-27 02:49:44

She was in there for a couple weeks because complications and at one point they decided to do a colonoscopy. She got to come home, but last week they told her the results were that she had colon cancer. They said there was a large effected area, but that it don't think it's aggressive and believe they have a chance to remove it all with surgery. She's scheduled in for April 24th.  I'm hopeful that the surgery will remove it all and that she'll be cancer free afterwards, but I'm also nervous because the surgery is high risk for her due to her other health conditions. 

My relationship with my mother is... Complicated. She has always smoked a lot, and my paternal Nana's dying wish (like literally, she told me this the night before she died unexpectedly so it was a little eerie) was to help my mother realize that she needs to quit or otherwise it will kill her one day. I tried and tried... I would write whole multi-page essay type papers when I was 10 and slide them under her bedroom door at night, I would hide her smokes, I would spew facts about smoking and health out at random, I would tell her that I would use my allowance to buy her nicorette patches or gum or whatever. I would beg.... But she wouldn't listen. After years of trying, I'll admit I gave up. 

 When I was 12-15, she struggled with alcoholism and depression. This was a very difficult time for me as a tween/young teenage girl. I would come home and find her passed out on the floor (she was unemployed) and have to help her up the stairs to her room. I was always scared opening the house door after school, that she would fall down the stairs one day while and I'd find her dead. I always made sure I walked into the house before my little brother, just in case. When she was awake, she was a mean drunk and we'd fight often. She went to the hospital psych ward twice for a couple months. 

When I was 16, she started getting a little better. Things were pretty okay for a few years, but she never physically recovered from the damage she did to her body over those years (all she did was smoke and drink - many days she ate nothing), hence her underlying conditions that make the surgery such a risk. 

When I was 20ish, she left to live with my Nana (not the one who passed, this one was her mother) in another city. During this time, I hardly saw her. Maybe 3/4 times a year, on holidays. Shortly after, I found out my Nana had cancer. My mom stayed with her during her 5 year battle with cancer, until she passed away in 2017. 

I had my daughter August 2018. My mom (who had been living in the other city) moved back in with my dad, to be closer to her granddaughter. She absolutely loves her. She has been out babysitter the last year while I was working so they spend a lot of time together (to be clear, she is no longer struggling with alcoholism).


Anyway... I love my mom, but I don't feel sad for myself if she were to pass away from this. I'd move on. I am though angry she never listened to me as a child. Angry at myself that I couldn't stop her smoking. Angry that she won't treat this as a wake up call because she's so stubborn, she 100% thinks this is hereditary and has nothing to do with her lifestyle choices. Saddened that my daughter could grow up without her grandma. Saddened that my mother will miss out on seeing my daughter grow up. I always thought my mom would die young. She's 54. 

My husband asked me how I was taking the news. I didn't know what to say. The emotions I feel are so complex. I'm trying not to think too much about it until after the surgery. We'll see what happens. It's out of my control. I can only hope for the best at this point and hope that she'll learn from this. 

I also can't believe this is happening in the middle of a global pandemic.  Not that there's ever a good time for cancer, but... It's certainly a very bad time. I'm worried a little that cancer surgeries like my mom's (non-aggressive) will be postponed and that it could spread and get worse in that time. Or that she gets COVID-19 and that could be devestating too since she's high risk for that too.

Sorry for the long rant post, I just had to get that all off my chest.",2020-04-04 00:18:10

He had to have his gallbladder out, he fell in the hospital and broke his femur and then when he recovered from that he fell at home and broke his arm.

Now he‚Äôs woken up from surgery and is a shell of his former self. He‚Äôs mostly asleep but when he‚Äôs awake he says things that don‚Äôt make sense and talks to people that are not there. It‚Äôs so scary. He says things like ‚ÄúI hear apples‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs that car doing?‚Äù 

No one prepared me. My mom is constantly watching him. She lives at the hospital. I flew in from out of state not realizing how he was. She left me with him to go take a shower while he slept. He woke up and was livid. He started to pull out his IV, electrodes, everything. I begged him not to do this and he called me a bunch of horrible names. I could see the fury in his eyes. He took off his dressing gown and tried to get out of the bed naked. I screamed for the nurses down the hallway, and they rushed in and started to try and calm him down. They upped his pain meds and he fell asleep. 

He talks to people that aren‚Äôt there. He calls me the name of his sister even though I‚Äôm his daughter. He‚Äôs so confused and out of it. He has no idea what‚Äôs going on. He makes me take off socks on his feet that are not there. It‚Äôs like he has dementia but he‚Äôs only 67

He gets agitated at least once a day and tries to escape the hospital to the point he injured himself a little and my mom and nurses who tried to stop him. 

They don‚Äôt really know why he‚Äôs like this other than what they call ‚Äúhospital delirium‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt know if this is the end or not. I wanted my dad to be at my wedding ceremony (already married but wanting to celebrate), but him being sick has taken precedence over that.

We were on the concert and just when the show was over my other friend calls me, telling that his mother just died, he said me not to tell this to him.
Leaving the place I was shaking hands to the other friends, the whole time I was shaking, stunned by knowing the truth that he doesn't know yet. I thought the best decision here would be to spend time as fun as possible, but then I see my friend coming out with the phone in his hands, with the white face that was full of shock. I knew what phonecall he got.
A few hours ago I went for a walk with him and man, I've never seen him like that before. He wanted to cry so hard but he just couldn't (he said it himself), now I feel myself terrible too, but not as close as he does.
He is only 16. His dad is an asshole, accusing others for not helping him, when at the same time the only thing he is doing is just drinking for weeks.
I feel so sorry for him (friend, not his dad), his family always had troubles with money, but now the mother just died. At least he has a grown up sister. Today we all have collected the money for him, at least he won't be having troubles with that, 'cause he actually knows how to survive for a long time with the limited finances, life was quite tough to him and it made him strong.

I wish no one ever will face that. Peace.",2020-03-15 03:32:35

Hi, I hope this is ok to post. One of my closest friends had a baby about 6 months ago, 3 months after I gave birth. In the middle of her pregnancy, her husband was diagnosed with cancer. They‚Äôve decided today to stop treatment because he has not been responding to it. 

Her closest friends and I are hoping to fly out to see her very soon. I want to balance being there for them with giving them their time and space. I also want to know if there are any gifts we can send, chores we can outsource for them, or other things we can do from out of state to provide additional support and relief before and after we are able to physically be there with her. We‚Äôve been sending gift cards for food delivery so they don‚Äôt have to cook, and are considering sending baby supplies. There was a gofundme collected for them so hopefully they are not struggling financially, but we want to provide any additional support or relief in some small way however we can. Is there anything that we may not realize is on her plate we can somehow help alleviate? In other circumstances I would send food, or alcohol, or something sentimental, but under these circumstances I don‚Äôt think any of those things would be helpful. 

Again, I‚Äôm sorry if this is inappropriate to ask here and I don‚Äôt want to invade or take advantage of this community. Please let me know if you‚Äôd like me to delete. Thank you for letting me post here.",2020-03-11 05:37:54
Should I travel right now?,5,fd60y1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/fd60y1/should_i_travel_right_now/,10,1583317437.0,"I'm 23, I want to visit my boyfriend in Ireland for about a week but I'm afraid to be exposed to covid-19 while flying and bring it back. My mom is being treated for cancer right now. Am I being selfish by considering traveling? There are lots of factors so I hope I don't forget anything.

1. My mom has gotten cancer for the 4th time (due to immuno-suppressants from a kidney transplant in 2009) and this time she is doing chemo and radiation. She started chemo in January and the radiation last week, which will go for 7 weeks (until mid April). She has a great support group and is doing well. 

2. My dad died last year suddenly, and it's been really hard for me for a number of reasons I won't get into. Many of my friends dipped and I've felt very alone. 

3. My boyfriend is great but he's Irish and long distance is really hard for me, though we've been together for two years now and try to see each every few months. Unfortunately he's trying to find a job and thus cannot visit me in the next few months. 

4. Things are bad for me right now so I'm trying to plan a trip! My mom is supportive of this, and we've talk about it at length, but says she cannot make the decision for me. She's been sick all my life but is very strong and healthy most of the time. I want to do what is best for her but I try to balance that with my own interests. I do help her when I can but my depression/anxiety makes it difficult (I feel awful about this all the time so please don't be mad at me). 

5. Airports are germ havens + the virus apparently has a long incubation period. 

6. Will I regret not traveling now because the spread of the virus might get much worse in the summer or fall? 

7. Apparently she will be ""doing worse"" once finishing radiation than when she's on it, and so visiting before it's over seems like a better option if I visit at all, but I can always go in May, I don't know. 

I know this is a complicated situation. I just don't know what to do. Any input would be much appreciated.",2020-03-04 10:23:57
Did you seek therapy? I‚Äôm still a mess.,6,fbj9hr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/fbj9hr/did_you_seek_therapy_im_still_a_mess/,13,1583039926.0,"Did any of you seek therapy to help you through? Was it helpful?

It‚Äôs been 2 weeks and I‚Äôm struggling to cope with the news of my Mum‚Äôs cancer (stage IV). I try to put on a brave face but I cry most days. She wants to know that I will be okay. I can‚Äôt say that I will because she is my best friend and I can‚Äôt imagine my life without her in it. This is my worst nightmare. I am going to see my doctor tomorrow to see if there is anything he can give me to help with the panic I have been feeling. I know there is nothing that can help heal the heartache and the shock. 

Yesterday, I laid in bed all day. All I could think was I‚Äôm wasting precious time but I just could not get up and this makes me feel so guilty. I did eventually get up and go around to my parent‚Äôs and we had dinner together. 

I know googling is bad and I‚Äôve been trying to avoid doing that, but it‚Äôs all bad news. But then I feel like maybe stage IV is wrong, the cancer is on her kidney and in her pelvis and a little bit in her hips. Not in other organs. Could it not be worst case scenario? Can‚Äôt they just take out the kidney and zap the bone cancer? I don‚Äôt know if this is denial or hopefulness. There‚Äôs still a bone biopsy to be done to determine whether it‚Äôs one cancer or different types. They said the oncologist said that kidney cancer is one of the ‚Äòbetter‚Äô cancers to treat (but has already said treatable but not curable). He also said that if the bone cancer is from the kidney, that‚Äôs a better scenario. I don‚Äôt know how much time we are talking and I honestly don‚Äôt want to know.

I feel sick about it. I have never been so stressed in all my life. I have lost interest in eating. I haven‚Äôt watched TV in 2 weeks. I have been sleeping a lot. In between I‚Äôve been going to work. I was a couple of hours late the other day because when my alarm went off, I couldn‚Äôt even keep my eyes open. Work has been really supportive and understanding and have told me to do whatever I need to do. My manager genuinely cares about my wellbeing, as do my colleagues. I just seem to be operating on autopilot. I know none of this is helpful to my Mum but I‚Äôve been trying to do practical things, making a family calendar so that we all know what is happening and when. Picking up medications for my parents. Ironing. Cleaning up. Being the clown that I am to make them smile. I just can‚Äôt talk to my sisters about this because they are as heartbroken and shocked as I am and I can‚Äôt afford to completely breakdown because I may not restart again. 

It is just so hard to reconcile that she is so sick, because she looks so well.",2020-03-01 05:18:46

My grandfather was diagnosed with stage 4 liver/ colon cancer over the summer. He was doing chemo through 2nd week in December and it was keeping it contained and the chemo didn't seem to be hurting him too badly. He was supposed to be moving and switching chemo centers but a house sale fell through last minute and it didn't happen. The rescheduling of his next chemo got pushed out 2 weeks further. I'm not totally positive if it was just the doing of the dr office or if he pushed it out further as well. Anyway, in that time frame, it spread. They now believe it's in his bone marrow, his lymph nodes and his kidneys. He never got another chemo treatment and has officially ended chemo as, at this point, it won't do anything positive for him. I feel so angry at the dr for putting his chemo off an extra two weeks and letting it spread! I don't even actually know if it was the drs fault/ choice but I guess I need someone to blame and be angry at. I've never lost someone so close to me and it hurts so bad! At his last appointment, prior to his last scan, the dr said 3 to 6 months. He goes this Friday for a face to face with the dr for an updated time frame. I'm not handling this very well. I feel as though I'm already grieving losing him and that it's morbid and not okay. I feel selfish for being so sad for myself because I can't begin to imagine how my grandmother, his wife of over 50 years, and my mother are feeling. This is the craziest mix of emotions I've ever felt. On top of that, I keep reminding myself that he's the one living knowing that he doesn't have much longer so how minuscule is my grief when I get to continue living and he has to wake up every morning knowing his fate.

Of course I did in some way. In July she was told she had 1-2 years left. At that point I kind of figured something was really up. In October she had her last appointment where she found out it has been growing quickly and now the time frame was unforeseen. Before this she had been in bed and not really getting up and about. She had stopped eating meals, only once a day, and it was obvious that she was depressed. Then it has been downhill from there. We had to admit her to the hospital because we found out she hadn't been taking her medicine in awhile. We don't even know when she stopped. I was trying to give her space, but that was my mistake.  


Now that week/weekend was a blur for me. My niece from New York came home. My oldest niece was by my side. It felt surreal to me with all the things happenings. Hospice was called. We had to move her bedroom to the living room. So much to set up and deal with. It was so much to deal with and still is. Slowly my mother has been declining and it's been getting worse this past week.  


She has no appetite. She only eats when we are about to give her medicine or when she randomly wants some certain food. She has been getting more confused about things. She can't leave her bed anymore because she's weak.   
When I found out she didn't have long to live, I was a mess. I cried every day. I was just hysterical even at random times. Now I find myself numb. I want to cry. I want to vent, but sometimes it doesn't happen. I have several others here with me in the house to help which is very good. I just feel alone though. I have never dealt with grief or losing someone so close to me. I'm so scared when it finally happens. I've never been super close to my mom as we have had a relationship with a lot of ups and downs.   


I'm trying to be here, but honestly, I don't know what to do. She sleeps downstairs in the living room and sleeps most of the day and is alert at some points of the day. I have read some articles telling me to just sit with her and talk. I've tried asking about tv, music, coloring. If anyone could offer me advice on anything I can do, please please do.   


There is so much going through my head. Today we had her sign the POA papers which just made me feel awkward because this is very overwhelming. I also want to state that I am not trying to shame my mom or sound rude with anything I said. I am just very stressed with everything. I love my mom even through our strained relationship.

Christmas for my cousin,5,dxfg6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/dxfg6c/christmas_for_my_cousin/,3,1573979924.0,"An ad for this reddit popped up on my dashboard the day my little cousin was diagnosed with cancer. I've been reading through it the past few days. He's 19 and was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Initially, they thought it was stage II, but his test results on Friday showed it's stage IV. His oncologist says the prognosis is good, but is concerned it's spread to his bones. He says even if it has, he's still confident of a positive outcome. I don't know all the details. My cousin and his parents are a few hundred miles away, so I've had to get this news secondhand from my mom. (Not that I'm complaining about it, I don't expect my aunt and uncle to broadcast everything and worry about that while their family is going through this.)

My grandmother hosts Christmas every year, with my big extended family. We're a tight-knit group. She's in PA with the majority of my extended family. My immediate family and I are in VA, and my cousin and his family are in TN. My cousin is starting chemo very soon and won't be able to come to the Christmas gathering. (Of course, everyone in my family would be willing to come to TN for him in a second, but he can't be around a lot of people because his immune system will be weakened.) Of course, provided him and his family are up to it (both physically and emotionally), we can skype them into the festivities. But I wanted to think of more ways to make this more of a normal, or at least good, holiday for him.

I did have one idea. I was thinking everyone in the family could make or buy an ornament with some of his favorite things, and things to do with inside jokes and stuff, so they can hang on his tree at home and we'll have a little piece of us there with him. I don't know if that's silly. What do you think of that? Is it silly? Any other ideas?

Thank you in advance, and wishing health and happiness to everyone and their families.",2019-11-17 08:38:44

But after a certain point, I realized my friends may not be able to understand and I might make them uncomfortable.
  In July, my mom had felt around her breasts and had found a mysterious lump. She went to the doctor, and after a biopsy and ect, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Thankfully, she found it so early that it wasn‚Äôt even at stage 1. So she had surgery a month later and got it removed, and I thought ‚Äúthank god, it‚Äôs over.‚Äù
  Oh boy was I mistaken.
 Yesterday, I came home after a school club trip, only to find my mom trying to stop crying while my father consoled her. Honestly, I thought nothing of it (of course I cared though) as she tends to breakdown and cry quite often. She told me to tell her about my day, which I did but she kept crying through it. I knew something was up.
   After incessantly asking her what was wrong, she told me the Cancer is still there, and got worse. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an aggressive type,‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúI start chemo in a week or so, and I‚Äôll be doing it for 4 months followed by radiation. I‚Äôm also taking a year off work.‚Äù She also explained her survival rate was high. 
   I think after a few months of dealing with this, everything sort of hit me. I started crying the hardest I‚Äôve ever cried‚ÄîI was scared.

Now my brother in law has full custody. 

We have gone from seeing my niece frequently to almost not at all. 

We had a big family reunion scheduled on our side of the family in two weeks- we plan these every year and he had the date marked on his calendar and we had already talked about taking my niece. Instead he booked a trip for them and she will not be coming.

We now know he was discharged *with* his CT result card that stated he had growths in major organs too - though no one presented this information; he found it in with his medication a couple of weeks later and obviously got quite a shock.

At his follow up appointment the doctor remarked something along the lines of it seemed amazing he didn‚Äôt look like he was at deaths door, considering his results (again - results he had to discover himself, after mistakenly handing it over to the pharmacist with his sharps - the pharmacist reading it and insisting he take it back).

It‚Äôs been approx 4 weeks since the follow up appointment and he has a follow up endoscopy and MRI of the liver this week.

The drawing out of this uncertainty is very upsetting for us all - he has no date for a follow up appointment, post tests, yet.

So last month I had an abcess on my appendix.  I had a drain put in and sent home.  Well last friday I finally had my appendix removed. It was sent to pathology and well it came back as cancerous.  Turns out that when the abcess ruptured it spread the cancer cells on a portion of my colon and possibly my abdomen.  Apparently the cancer cells that are just chilling on my colon dont have a blood supply so they will not respond to chemotherapy.  I will have to travel to San Diego (12 hour drive)  to have a portion of my colon removed and another procedure that will raise my body temp in order to kill these dumb cancer cells. There are alot of unknowns and i am super nervous.  Well thanks for listening and hope to give an update soon. Amanda,2019-04-23 13:05:38

I am his oldest daughter, the one he proudly carried around, not that he wasnt proud of my siblings but he learned to ""dad"" with me. 
I remember him teaching me all our ancestors names, pictures hanging on a wall, he would point at them and i would say the name. He was always so happy when i got it right...
My strong father, my return point, my safe house... when I moved away to another country and got married he told me ""no matter how things turn or how far you are, you can always come home to me"".

He was diagnosed with an agressive bladder cancer 3 years ago, doctors removed it, gave him chemo and the next year it was back, stronger and bigger. Same thing, just this time he got a sepsis while recovering on the hospital.

He is very stubborn, that is what the doctor told him when he recovered from that, one kidney was the cost. Chemo didnt sit well with him, food was hard to keep inside, pain on his stomach and a stroke.

Still he kept pushing. Always strong, always smiling when i video call him but he looks like the cancer had aged him, he looks tired sometimes, he looked scared and nervous.

Today he was told the cancer is back, even without a bladder, he still has the same cancer lurking. He had just gotten his hair back. I know he is scared, I am scared too and I am so far away from him.

My father, my safe house, my rock... I love him so much.

I refuse to look up the stages and all that but I know it‚Äôs not great. It may sound naive but I choose to believe that a miracle can happen no matter the odds.

Anyway, my immediate problem is that my mother is constantly in pain. I know this is basically a given with chemo but I try to be there for her and I know there are people out in the universe with much more knowledge on this than I have. I genuinely am at a loss. Everything I say I can feel coming off as condescending or vomit-y. 

Her shoulders are always hurting. I bought her wrist weights and when she lost those I suggested water bottles or something to build strength. But many times the pain is too much for her. Keep in mind this is a woman who never complains and has a very high tolerance for pain.

She is so depressed. She‚Äôs always crying and I try to be soothing, comfort her. Rub her back and shoulders. I try to say some things or suggest we watch a movie. Sometimes she goes along and sometimes she says she won‚Äôt stay up or be comfortable or something. She cries all the time and I don‚Äôt know how to help her. She‚Äôs crying because she doesn‚Äôt want to be sick. But I can‚Äôt change that. I am here to keep her spirits up but how do I do anything when she is too weak and depressed to do anything fun? Too tired to watch anything uplifting? Too bloated to leave the house?

She sees a psychiatrist. A nutritionist was recommended, but we have yet to meet with her. I‚Äôve been bringing it up lately. None of us really cook. Most of the things she can stomach are probably not recommended in her condition. But she is a pretty picky eater.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm looking for here, but I am at a loss and if anyone has been in a similar situation, has any tips or tricks, I would be eternally grateful. This is so hard and I would never wish this on anyone.

How do you deal with having a family member with incurable cancer but they were abusive to their family when we were younger? 

We‚Äôve ‚Äúreconciled‚Äù as in the rest of us just moved on and sweep it under the rug but it‚Äôs still hard to deal with the lasting impacts of the abuses while still feeling love towards them.

I hate that they will have the control and power over me forever.  

And before someone jumped on saying it‚Äôs not right. Abused victims will never and can‚Äôt just ‚Äúget over it‚Äù towards their abuser. We will always have PTSD and other mental repercussions from it. We just learn how to cope and deal with it, especially if it‚Äôs close family member we still maintain relationships with.

Things they don't tell you,5,aiyjrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/aiyjrk/things_they_dont_tell_you/,0,1548269601.0,"So just last month I had surgery to remove a tumor and get rid of cancer for the third time in just the last 3 years.  I went through chemo and radiation once before.  All testicular or in that vicinity.

Don't make the same mistakes I did.  I went through my first treatment in Orlando and the facility, which is no longer around, bullied me into paying my chemo on a credit card since I didn't have the money to pay for it.  Don't ever do this!  Get more opinions, check everywhere for treatment options and ways to pay.  I'm still dealing with all of those bills to this day.  Cards are maxed anymore but it's been hard to pay them down going through it twice since then.

Also, I thought I was in the clear, so we bought a house in April 2018.  My wife's disabled so it was virtually all through my income that we were able to get a home for our family.  When I started having my latest issues in August, it took a couple of months to figure it out and then another month to get the money together for surgery once the tumor was found.  Thankfully still stage 1.

All of the Dr visits, tests, and finally surgery basically put us in the hole with our mortgage and even though at first the bank said they'd work with us, when I submitted the application for modification, we were denied because our loan was too new, less than 12 months old.

It's been disheartening getting the foreclosure letter.  I'm basically riding out being 60 days behind and trying to work OT and hope that a tax return will get us a month closer to being back on time.  I'm still making payments just we are two months behind.  My credit is shot being behind two months and high usage on my credit cards.  Can't get a modification, no FHA title 1 loan, can't tap my 401k.  Running out of options.

My point is, if you speak with anyone about a bill, get names, write down times and dates, who you spoke to, everything.  Don't just accept that they may have notes your account, because that doesn't always happen and you get screwed.  I started a GoFundMe account and thankfully that's helped as we're almost to 43% now.  

Just make sure you talk about finances long and hard if you have a diagnosis.  Think short and long term and double check all the info you're given.  I don't wish this stress on anyone and most deft not on someone diagnosed or recovering from cancer.",2019-01-23 18:53:21

My mom was diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer last April, so we're approaching a year. I can't remember what medicine they started her on, but they were getting the results they had hoped, so about 4 months ago they started her on abraxane - once a week for 3 weeks, followed by one week off.

I live about 3 hours away, so I don't get to see her every day. (My brother and our aunt live in the same city, so she's got some solid support.) Last night my mom told me that she'd been waking up in the middle of the night just drenched from night sweats. She says it's been going on for a while, that she gets these a few times a week.

She said she's mentioned it to her doctor, but I'm not certain. Is anyone familiar with this? Is anyone aware of something like this happening?

Thanks in advance for the input. ",2019-01-08 03:11:09

My step mother slipped and injured her hip. After x-rays, scans, and tests related to the fall they found the cancer. It had caused lesions on her bones. A lot of them. The doctors moved forward with chemo. We were hopeful and things were looking good. Then it started spreading. She applied for special trials.

She was fine and active for most part, just had a headache. This is an 89 year old woman who would walk a mile every morning, go up and down steps without a problem, no fall ever, cook full blown meals, do hours of yard work.... reduced to the bed, struggling to speak and move, within the last week. We tried treatments that we‚Äôre unsuccessful. Last was radiation on one of her areas about a two months ago. A few months ago, maybe three, we were told that she doesn‚Äôt need cancer medication any longer and gave her about 5-6 months. A few weeks ago my brother, a cooking fool, came to visit and was able to get her appetite up to where she was asking for cakes and pies and eating decent for her state for majority of his stay. Now the last three days, she barely eats. Also every swallow brings coughing. She‚Äôs told my mother she wants to die, too exhausted to go on, twice in last couple of days. I see it, quite frankly I understand. Would I be devastated, yes! However I‚Äôm not a selfish person, I live in reality. If I myself had the choice I‚Äôd go the minute I was stuck in bed. That‚Äôs no way to live. We will be hurt when she goes, however relieved. I have noticed some things these past days of watching her. Are the following signs of pre or active dying? She breaths heavy, says she is not uncomfortable though. Can barely swallow. Unable to lift herself(was able to about two weeks ago) Sleeps all day. Speaks low and not clearly. Something new: seems to be talking in her sleep. It started today. It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs dreaming. It was in a rhythm like she was pleading or singing. I would go in the first couple times, but quickly realized she was not calling for help as she said she was fine and comfortable. So I began to just listen for my name or my mothers name to know when to go in. It‚Äôs very unnerving though. She also was more clear when speaking out during these times. Can anyone shed some light on this? Is she at the end? Is it possible she will regain strength if we take her to a facility rather than keep her here? She wanted to stay in her home, but I wonder if that is the right choice. I guess being told you will die in half a year at 89 is more promising than just a slim possibility of getting better.

I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian a few days ago. She was healthy as a horse, until all of a sudden she wasn't. I have a very sickly father, and we always assumed he would pass before she would, and she would get to enjoy life. I live in Hong Kong and they are all in the USA and we all had a family FT while they told me. 

I want so badly to be near her right now - to hold her hand, to tell her she's got me and that I love her. My dad and my little brother (just graduated college) are so good but honestly ehy are both depressed/depressing to be around and my family has always counted on me to be the positive energy/glue to the family, even though I moved away 3.5 years ago. I just turned 27. I feel really hopeless.

Because of COVID, coming home to the states to visit is an enormous ordeal. Quarantining, getting proper testing, making sure I don't bring anything to my mom while she is having chemo. I pray that I could be by her side if she goes, but there's almost going to be no chance of it - she needs my happy and positive energy around her. I texted her today, just praying that she texted me back (which she did, with a lot of ""i love you""s).

I also can't leave my job in HK for that long (I haven'd told them yet, but will tell them this week). It's like every feeling I had prior to the diagnoses was so carefree - and now I feel like I'll never be OK ever again.",2020-10-26 23:00:47

I don't know how to handle it, how to handle the uncertainty, the bad news and the waiting times. It is a bit of a rant I just needed to write it.

My (F 20s) father (M 50s) was sent to the emergancy room on the 4th of september. He had multiple health complaints including not being able to eat and sweating a lot. They expected lymphoma.

In the first week the doctors did some scans/tests. After a week they presented the results. It was a large mass/tumor behind the some organs. They said he needed surgery and he would talk to a sergeon on monday. They also found a small other spot wich was mysterieus.

Monday the sergeon told them he first wanted to do more tests. 

He needed a biopsy. He got that bioptie on that friday, the thursday after he recieved the results. It was bad. It is a rare and agresive type of sarcoma with a high recuring rate. It is unlikely that he will gett totaly clean and that the cancer will never return. 

The message of the doctors that day was the same as a week earlier, he probably needs surgery but first we want to do more tests.

Next tuesday some doctors had a discussion about the small spot. Today we got the 'results' of de discussion, and it is effectively the same 'He needs surgery but we want to do more tests'. They want to biopsy the smal spot before deciding on the surgery. The biopsy might* take place on tuesday. The results of this biopsy will take 2 weeks.

In the meanwile he is constantly in pain, is sleeping more than he is awake, barely eats and has lost 20 kg in the last month.

It has already been a month of uncertainty, waiting, receiving bad news, waiting some more and receiving more bad news. Now we have to wait another 2 1/2 weeks before we will get more news, until they will hopefully finally have a treatment plan.

How can I handle this uncertainty?
How do I handle probably losing my father?

I am really struggling because I am in a position where I don‚Äôt know if I should put my life on hold, get out of my lease, and move into my parents house to be there to support them and spend time with them.

All I know is that she's not terminal.

For the past month she was taking tests and I thought yesterday she was finally going through with chemo on Monday but then today I found out she won't go through with it. Instead she'll pursue a different kind of treatment where, from how I understand it, is like some hard-core 60 day detox where she'll starve the cancer cells. She'll be consuming organic vegetables and have like lymphatic massages. This treatment has had success stories at least. I know it's not a ""spa treatment"". She'll be losing so much weight because her body won't be gaining any but at first glace it really sounds like a glorified spa treatment.

I don't know. I'm skeptical but I'm not telling her don't do that just go through with chemo because she has a right to her treatment and she believes with her whole being that this will cure her and she'll survive and fight the cancer this way. I'm not stopping her but I'm so frustrated because if these 60 days becomes the difference between terminal or not, I don't know if I'll be able to accept that decision.

I want to support her and be there for her in person because I can but in all honesty, I just want to hide and run away. I know chemo has really bad side effects and she's scared of chemo and I can't force her to take chemo but I have more faith in chemo than the treatment she's choosing to pursue. I know her and she's thought really hard about it and she's pushing through with it no matter what. 

I just can't stop all the what ifs in my head though. ""What if this doesn't work and she just wasted 2 months?"" or "" what if she gets worse during those two months?"" or ""what am I gonna do if she dies?""

She's asked me to pray for her and she has a real close relationship with God. She believes everything happens for a reason and that God can save her and has given her all of these blessings and God will never abandon her, but I can't get behind that. I believe in a god, whether that's Jesus or some other higher power, a god probably does exist, but I don't know if this god really has so much power over this. I don't want to pray because it seems half assed but I want to pray out of support, but if I'm not in it 100% I don't know.

Help and advice please.,4,hhap3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/hhap3t/help_and_advice_please/,0,1593360268.0,"Stage ?3 laryngeal cancer

A close relative has just been diagnosed. It surrounds the larynx and has spread to the glands at either side of the larynx - still unsure at the moment if it has spread anywhere else. The relative is late 70s, has a pacemaker in situ after a heart attack several years ago and is currently taking apixaban as an anticoagulant treatment. Still unsure as to whether the surgery can go ahead (more biopsies and explorations to be carried out in the next few weeks). At the moment options are 1) surgery to remove the tumour and larynx completely followed by radiotherapy, 2) radiotherapy 5 days a week to try and kill the tumour, 3) no surgery or treatment - just take each day as it comes. We are struggling to help the relative understand about the surgery. They understand that tumour/larynx will be removed and that they won‚Äôt be able to speak. But they aren‚Äôt understanding about a stoma being in place, the care of the stoma and what adjustments will have to be made. Does anyone have any helpful advice or words of support? 

Most of this has fallen onto my shoulders as I‚Äôm the only one in the family to be able to take in all the information accurately and ask appropriate questions. I‚Äôve had to get a sick line to be able to take time off work to deal with this all, we are around 50 miles from the hospital that we are dealing with so I would be struggling to juggle work on top of this and also ‚Äònormal‚Äô family life. 


We still have yet to be assigned a cancer specialist key worker so hopefully things will get easier once one is in place. As a small, close family this is the first time we have had to deal with someone so close to us having cancer - it‚Äôs going to be a struggle.

5 years of cancer,4,hdehtd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/hdehtd/5_years_of_cancer/,2,1592802238.0,"So I kinda just need to vent somewhere since I don't feel like bothering my friends because of something like this.

My father died of liver cancer when I was sixteen so he cant help me to deal with all of this. 
 
Shortly after I turned 15 (I just turned 20) my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer and that found metastases in her bones right away, after some radiation and other stuff it turned out she had also some metastases in her liver (so many that they were probably already there when they found the ones in her bones) which are the main problem by now.
She did chemotherapy, one of the hard ones where you lose all of your hair and shit. Since then she's been on and off of different medications, they all work for a while, like 2 weeks or sometimes even a few months but then she has to switch because they stop working.
Today she told me the tumor markes doubled since the last check up (they check them every second week) so it's pretty clear this medication only worked for 5 months. 

She has to switch again and every time she does new side effects appear etc. Also at some point there just won't be any treatment left and I'm so fucking terrified of this day.

When my father was diagnosed it was really soon very clear there isn't much anyone can do for him. They told him he only had about 6-24 months, he died 4 months after the diagnosis so it's harder for me to trust any predictions. 

I'm just really scared of losing her too. My brother's literally on another continent right now and I'm scared of bothering my friends with this new since it's definitely not the first time it happens and it's no surprise it all and it's not like anything really changes since this happened a lot of times before.

My mother will never be cured and we kinda knew this from the start. So I just feel like I'm making this bigger than it is and that I'm over dramatic, but it's still cancer and even though I'm not the ill one it kind of kills me too.",2020-06-22 05:03:58

My fiancee has had IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) since she was quite young. Lately, she's been feeling stitch like pains in her LEFT lower abdomen, so she got a colonoscopy, as well as a CT scan and X-ray scan. The doctors did not find ANYTHING on her left side, but noticed a 15cm growth in her large intestine, right next to her appendix, on her RIGHT side.

We haven't received the biopsy results yet. The problem is that we're not sure if this is a tumor or a benign growth, and the doctors are saying that whatever it is, it will need to be removed surgically. (by cutting out a part of her large intestine, and linking it to the ileum. Now, IF the biopsy results come back and it turns out to be cancer, we will have to worry about it then, but if it is NOT cancer, and just a benign growth, what is the best way to treat this? If anyone has had any similar experiences, please feel free to share some insight on what the problem was, how it was treated, and any side effects or lessons learned during the whole ordeal.

Such a sweetheart that he never even saw how good and special he will and still is.  So we‚Äôve been knowing each other for some years now, and when i got on the app like 5 minutes ago, I‚Äôm JUST NOW reading his text about him having the cancer and it sent me numb. 

Like okay, the entire month of February was very hard for me, especially to communicate back to everyone who‚Äôs apart of my life, online or in real life. The chances of me SEEING what he sent me on the day  would‚Äôve been slim either way. So me getting upset about it is pointless.    I wasn‚Äôt even coherent the entire month, nor did i want to bother anybody with my wowes or concerns. I‚Äôm that type of person yes.

So I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs disrespectful to repeat what he said to me, but deep down I don‚Äôt want too. What i WILL share is summing up what he basically told me.

#He basically said a year ago (which at that time we wasn‚Äôt talking consistently like we used too, so I wouldn‚Äôt have known cause he didn‚Äôt tell me until February 18th of this year) 

##That he was diagnosed with throat cancer WHICH spread to his hips and back. He‚Äôs at stage 4 and has been doing chemo, but he don‚Äôt know how long he got. That‚Äôs the words he told me, I‚Äôm just telling you in the third person cause rereading that message again, i might loose my mind.

But he‚Äôs 19 going on 20 I believe since he‚Äôs- oh wait yes he was born 2000 even so we are 3 years and some months apart. So he‚Äôs still a baby, and our relationship has had it‚Äôs up and downs like every other relationship, but he‚Äôs been there when I‚Äôve had my worst moments and vise verse. He knows me well, and i know him well. At the time i met him he acted like a bigger brother to me cause my ONLY brother wasn‚Äôt even there. So he filled that role, and i just kept him company. We never met, we almost did, but sadly it never happened.

##I was there when he got shot, i was there when he got jumped, i was there when he almost died a few times, and I‚Äôve been there when he was having bad family issues. He‚Äôs been there for me woah, I can‚Äôt even count the occasions he was there to comfort me for. Theres so many, just like thinking about the times we had good or bad, there‚Äôs just so many in the 3 years I‚Äôve known him. I would say of course more good then bad, he broke my heart when he ended the relationship because of stupidity, but we made up. 


And now that he might die, or is already dead just sent me out the box. Like writing this i could cry, but at the same time I‚Äôm so numb. He‚Äôs so young, has such a nice soul/mind and heart but just doesn‚Äôt see it. He never did. Will he die like that? I can‚Äôt dwell on it cause he‚Äôs not dead. And that‚Äôs my belief, he‚Äôs just sleeping and i will get to see him again. But i STILL wouldn‚Äôt want him to go out like that. Not like that, nor at this time.

How many more people do i have to loose to finally loose myself? I‚Äôve lost so many online friends, and people I‚Äôve known in real life. There‚Äôs so many that i feel like i SHOULD be next one so I don‚Äôt have to endure anymore deaths. But what i CAN say is, i do believe in God, and i do believe in the dead coming back. So it‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt have hope or anything, i DO thanks to my mother showing me about Jehovah god, it‚Äôs just still my imperfection that gets to me. I KNOW i can see the people I‚Äôve lost again, but then me being imperfect, i just want to give up and die too.

I WISH it were that easy. But I‚Äôm not dealt with those cards, and I‚Äôm tired of having to tell my friends ‚Äúhey things are ruff right now and I won‚Äôt be on my phone for a while, I‚Äôll text you when im back‚Äù i already feel so disappointed in myself for doing that in the past.

#Now i don‚Äôt want to let my friends that are still here down anymore. I can still celebrate them right? He k yes!!!!!! I still have people here who i can still talk too. Yes loosing friends are so sad and not fair at all, but the ones who are still here, still matter as well.    I ALREADY missed my friends text about him dying of cancer that i refuse to miss ANYMORE time with anyone of my online friends. Or the people in my life INGENERAL.

So that‚Äôs my rant for the night and i just found this subreddit so i thought i would leave it here. If anyone has anything to say I appreciate it. I‚Äôm so upset right now and i think i might cry myself too sleep. 

##This one hit hard especially because of how past relationships I‚Äôve had with people mimicked the same type of person Adrian is. I‚Äôve had many friends who were like Adrian and who also didn‚Äôt see what i saw. It‚Äôs so sad good people get terrible endings, but he and the rest of ALL the people in my life that have passed won‚Äôt be remembered by the suffering they went through. They will forever be remembered as how they greatly acted, how kind/sweet/special/loving/ and all of the above they were. They DESERVE to be remembered as the light that we all needed and had at the times we needed it most. 

They were there when we needed them. Moving forward i still have friends who shine light on my life. They make my life happier,  and give me different meanings everyday.

Mental Illness and Cancer,4,f7vr9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/f7vr9n/mental_illness_and_cancer/,3,1582421744.0,"My mom is mentally ill. Prior to her cancer diagnosis she had been diagnosed and treated for anxiety, and depression. Still not sure if that‚Äôs all of what she has. She was non compliant and non adherent with her mental health care in the past. Never completed therapy or medication. This has been going on forever. 

When she was initially diagnosed with non small cell lung cancer she had a week long psychotic episode. She was paranoid that the doctors and nurses were out to get her, didn‚Äôt trust the medicine they were giving her etc. Auditory and visual hallucinations. The works. Her admitting physician finally got psych involved and she was medicated. The psychotic episode has ended, but she is still distrusting and sometimes non compliant. She was placed in rehab after surgery. She‚Äôs refusing PT sometimes and refusing meds sometimes. She is extremely depressed, but is better than she was before. She is still under psychiatric care and has been going to counseling daily. She has been taking all of her psych meds. She has only been getting psychiatric treatment for 3 weeks and the effects of the meds take time. Time which she doesn‚Äôt really have. 

Her cancer has high levels of the genetic mutation that make it susceptible to effective treatment by Keytruda or other immunotherapy. 

From what I know now, from the rehab nurse, it looks like oncology doesn‚Äôt want to treat her at all. Other than palliative care and radiation, no chemo, no immunotherapy, because of her behavior, which is caused by her mental illness, which until now has not been treated.

She does not have brain cancer or dementia. All the docs have checked multiple times, mainly due to her sometimes irrational and erratic behavior. 

We have a meeting on Monday. We are moving her into assisted living after rehab to force a modicum of compliance with care. She is extremely non compliant with me so a facility would be better for her care. I am her only family and only child. My concern is that the docs may not give her a shot at treatment because of her underlying mental health issues. Which she is seeking treatment for, finally. 

She is otherwise competent. Very intelligent and aware of everything that is going on. She is young and if not for the mental health issues should be a candidate for aggressive treatment.

It‚Äôs a perfect storm. She‚Äôs finally getting mental health care but it may be to late. I know she wants to do treatment and will be devastated if that option is off the table.  

Anyone been through something like this? What should I do? I don‚Äôt want my mom to die of mental illness with cancer. Thoughts? Advice? Support? I am at a total loss here.",2020-02-23 01:35:44
My mom is dying.,5,f7lqub,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/f7lqub/my_mom_is_dying/,8,1582365497.0,"My mom was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer back in June of 2018. It had spread to her liver and lymph nodes. They gave her 3-6 months to live. 

It was devastating news. My mom is my best friend, we are so incredibly close. But she didn‚Äôt give up, she fought. She did multiple rounds of chemo and radiation. It shrunk the cancer, it gave us all hope. In January of 2019 she had her first operation on her liver. They had successfully removed 90-95% of the cancer. 

They let her heal, then brought her in to laser away the rest on her liver sometime a few months later. 

Then in October of 2019 they operated on her colon, removing a good portion of her colon. Leaving her with a stoma. 
This was the toughest part for her to get use to. She hated it, even so we all were stupidly hopeful. We thought she had beat it, we really fucking did‚Äî or at least I did.

They sent her home to heal. She began having issues with her kidneys, which they eventually attached a bag to it to drain it. During all of this she was going in for tests and ct-scans, again, I was hopefully. 

December 23rd the doctor calls, they tell us it‚Äôs returned... worse than it was before. They said she could begin chemo in the new year to extend her life the best they could. 

I was in denial, I refused to believe she couldn‚Äôt beat this. I kept insisting that once she starts chemo she will beat it. 

Once mid January came around, my mom broke the news to me. That she is not going to do chemo. 

Now I‚Äôm in an absolute state of despair. I feel as though I‚Äôm drowning. I‚Äôm lost. 

The thought of waking up one day, texting her good morning like I do every single day... only to never get a response again. Never to hear her laugh‚Äî see her smile‚Äî feel her arms around me when I need a hug.

I am struggling because we have never been really comfortable talkers together. We love each other and have said so much a few times, but I am pretty weird about emotions, and I don‚Äôt want him to think that I am ungrateful for all of the wonderful thing he has done for me.

I am all stream-of-consciousness right now, but I am really hoping I get there. Treatment comes next, and then I don‚Äôt know.

So my uncle has been diagnosed a few weeks ago with lung cancer. He is very shy about it now‚Äî doesn‚Äôt like to talk about it, doesn‚Äôt like to go out of the house, etc. (which is all understandable). I don‚Äôt want to push him on these subjects so perhaps some of you could fill me in on some questions I have. Honestly, I don‚Äôt even know what stage of lung cancer he‚Äôs in.

So, he had a bad cough for about 9-10 months before diagnosis. They kept thinking it was pneumonia, bronchitis, etc because it‚Äôs been 10 years or so before my uncle stopped smoking. Approximately what stage could he be in for him after 9 or 10 months after symptoms begin showing? He‚Äôs lost a lot of weight and looks worse for wear‚Äî part of which his wife blames on his medication.

What are some ways I could possibly comfort him? I know a few of his hobbies, such as riding his motorcycle and soccer, but I don‚Äôt think he can really participate in those anymore. He‚Äôs taking some sort of medication and whatnot, but it‚Äôs not looking very good. 


I found out about a week before thanksgiving. He hasn‚Äôt come to any family events (mainly thanksgiving/Christmas) since. I hopefully am going tomorrow to visit him with my dad tomorrow and see him for the first time since I‚Äôve heard the news. What can I say to him to comfort him? Is there anything I can do to get him out of the house? Is there anything I can do to be with the rest of his family? He‚Äôs the oldest of 8 and all of my aunts and uncles are very close, which is why I was hoping to see him at our family parties.


If you have any other advice that don‚Äôt specifically answer my questions, please give it. Thanks,",2019-12-26 12:32:47

We had a strained relationship because she was an alcoholic and burnt our house down when I was young and then her and dad spent the money on hotels and drugs. We were broke in months and as a result we lived in a van and I was taken out of school in elementary school.
She fucked my life up a lot. I have bad issues with self esteem and let people treat me bad because I think I‚Äôm lucky to have them. 
I repeated the domestic violence cycle. 
I got out. I wanted to fix things with her and then I find out she‚Äôs got cancer and her dr tells me she‚Äôs got 2-4 months. I‚Äôm trying to cope with that and the she gets pneumonia.
Now she‚Äôs in a coma in the hospital and can‚Äôt breathe on her own. I‚Äôve been here trying to make my peace. I wanted to tell her so many things but I didn‚Äôt get to.
I‚Äôve been in a spin since this happened and have fucked off everything else because I can‚Äôt cope. I have a lot to fix now. I just cannot believe this is happening.

I just need to vent. 

from the time I was 5 I have a lot of bad memories
My first one being my dad yanking my sister and I from our beds and running out of the house holding us and she screamed she was going to blow her brains out if he divorced her while holding a shot gun to her head. Crying.
The next day coming home and there‚Äôs a bullet
Hole in the roof of my room. She says she missed and it‚Äôs a sign from god. I see it every day and feel not good enough. 

We got out on a church fundraiser... expect it isn‚Äôt really one. We sell these church books for a fundraiser and they keep the money. I hate lying and feel horrible. 
She buys me a yoohoo and apple at the end every time.
She goes behind the car and ask for my yoohoo and I see her take a shot and chase it. I am 5 but I know what she‚Äôs doing is bad and I feel scared. 

The next day we drive around a lot and she drinks. 
She leaves us in the hot car and we are so thirsty so I get out and interrupt her and ask for a drink. 
She grabs me by my leg and uses it to flip my body to spank for interrupting adults.
She‚Äôs drunk. She accidentally breaks my leg doing this.
She realises what she‚Äôs done and drives us around for hours instead of going to the hospital and tells me if I don‚Äôt tell them I was fighting with my sister over a toy and broke it that way that they will put me in foster care where someone will rape me and I‚Äôll never see my family again.
We drive around for over 8 hours while I cry in pain until she finally calls my dad and tells him what happened and he takes me to get a cast. I lie. The hospital seems to know. 


They divorce. They come in and each make their case on who I should
Live with. I pick my dad because even this young I can feel that my mom isn‚Äôt stable. 
She comes in and breaks a rose we have her to
Pieces and says I do not love her.
It hurts.

She disappears. 
She comes back a year later and they act like she was never gone.
She‚Äôs a good mom. Things go good.
She relapses. We lose everything.
We move around a lot. I can‚Äôt make friends because of it. 
She‚Äôs in and out. 
We get stable. She pops up like nothing happened. They buy some businesses and get bad into drugs. 
I basically raise my little sister and we are so hungry often that my reaches start to catch on and take us for meals after class.
I hear them say it‚Äôll be our last night in this house but I don‚Äôt understand. 
She‚Äôs drunk the next day and I get off the bus to our home burning down and fire trucks and police everywhere.
We live in hotels. They pull me from school to homeschool but it never happens.
Insurance money wasted.
We end up living in a van driving from state to state panhandling. No education. No nothing.

We finally find a place and this family at church gives us a trailer. My mom gets a job and we become really
Close.  She starts to unravel because she thinks my dad is cheating. The woman in the family is after my dad and is convincing him my mom is drinking whine his back. They fight a lot. She takes my mom
To a hotel and pays for a week and stocks the room with alcohol. I never see her again after that. The woman tells us she has left us and she runs off with my dad.  I didn‚Äôt find the truth out for years later.

My brother commits suicide after he becomes an alcoholic and ends up in a physical fight with his wife who leaves him. I realise life is short. 
I wanted to tell my mom I don‚Äôt blame her. I know she grew up in domestic violence and substance abuse  ended up repeating the cycle. I wanted to share my
Good memories. I know she‚Äôs sober now though family and I want her to know my kids.
I get ahold of her and find out that it‚Äôs too late. She‚Äôs dying. She had emphysema and a brain tumour. She can‚Äôt walk. She can‚Äôt remember anything at all aside from some of the worst stuff.
At first she‚Äôs nasty and doesn‚Äôt want to speak to me. 
I am hurt but eventually she says she just doesn‚Äôt know me and doesn‚Äôt trust my dad who was abusive  to her and so she needs to keep some distance but wants to talk/ I do it. 
She says she doesn‚Äôt deserve me but wants to know me. 
And then she gets sick.
She will never meet my kids. I won‚Äôt be able
To repair this and just have a normal mom daughter relationship. 
My kids are the world to me and I can‚Äôt imagine that she didn‚Äôt miss me. I would wake up to her pounding the door drunk and my dad wouldn‚Äôt let her in. It would be raining hard. I would sneak her in. I would wake up to her rubbing my hair. Or she would get drunk and go out and beg so she could bring me back special vegetarian freezer meals. He would return them  and she would think she lost them bag while drunk and feel bad. She did love us. She was broken and messed up. She‚Äôs sober now but she‚Äôs a ghost of herself and she may not make it out of this pneumonia. 
I don‚Äôt know what to do. I left my phone at work and didn‚Äôt have one until today so I‚Äôve had no contact with anyone really and I just need to get all of this out of
Me. 
I‚Äôve shut everyone out.  All my life. I didn‚Äôt want to get hurt so I push people away before they can.


I just cannot believe I  waited too long.
She‚Äôs going to die. She‚Äôs terminal. 
There‚Äôs nothing I can do. I always thought we would fix it one day.

My dads cancer came back,5,e577ym,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/e577ym/my_dads_cancer_came_back/,5,1575356478.0,"This will be a long story, so I am sorry I'm advance. 

I am 18, and when I was 16 my dad fell ill. He went on a golfing trip with his buddies. Just a fun little getaway. When he got back, he felt a bit sick, just nauseous. So for a few days, we just thought it was the beer and wings he ate with his friends. Lol. 

But then those days turned to weeks, and we were getting concerned. He wasn't eating much. And he was starting to turn yellow, like his eyes and his skin had a tinge. I was worried, but thought it was nothing bad.
My mom took him into emergency, just to make sure everything was ok (we live in a small town). His blood work was all out of wack, and he has lost quite a bit of weight from not eating. 

Because of his blood work results, they did more tests (CT scan). Of course, since we live in a small town, our hospital does not have the materials for more complex testing to be done. So they referred him to the hospital in the largest city close to us, and he had more appointments.

They found a small lump completely blocking his gall bladder duct into the duodenum. There was no bile being secreted, so no oils could be broken down. That is why he was nauseous. They took a biopsy of it.

Of course, me being fairly innocent, thought it was an easy fix of just going down through his mouth to remove the lump (kind of like a gastroscopy, I guess). I was wrong. The doctors were unsure of whether or not it was cancer, so they scheduled him in for the Whipple surgery. They put a stint in his gall bladder so he was comfortable until they could do the surgery. 

My parents left me and my brother and travelled to the bigger city (about 3ish hours away) for the surgery. I was so scared. I guess that is normal, but I felt terrified and scared. I felt like my mind was like a skipping cd, if that makes sense. I was filled with worry for my dad. This was during exams, so I found it difficult to study. Of course, I felt so sad that my dad had to go through this. The whipple is not a small surgery. 

They removed 40% of his pancreas, his gall bladder, and a section of his duodenum. But, when I saw him, he was very much himself. He seemed ok, but thin. 

 he was doing very well. At home, running around, driving. The doctors said his recovery time was remarkably fast. We got the biospy results back, and the lump turned out to be cancerous. I felt so scared, but I remembered ""hey, they got it all out with the surgery. We're good."" They did put him on chemotherapy once a week for three weeks, then off for a week, for 6 months. 

Unfortunately, this made his kidneys sort of crap out, and he needed a urine bag that went directly into his right kidney. I was sad and scared, but they stopped doing the chemotherapy, so I guess that made me feel better. To anyone who has gone through chemo or has had a loved one go through it, I am very sorry. It's a really sad thing using poison to fight cancer.

But, after a while, his kidney function improved, and despite needing a stint in his urethra, the bag and tube were removed.  We were all so happy. He was finally back to normal. He started work, I started graduated and started university, everything was great.

My dad went to get a stint change, which usually caused a UTI. So no surprise when he felt a bit shitty after his latest stint change. But then he got worse. He was taken to the big city hospital, and his liver was not draining properly. They put a bag and tube there to drain it. Then we found out his cancer came back . He stayed in the hospital for a week, then he went home.

How to help a friend that has to deal with his mother‚Äôs cancer?,4,dw7z8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/dw7z8l/how_to_help_a_friend_that_has_to_deal_with_his/,3,1573757938.0,"  

Hello everyone! 

So I met this wonderful guy (both 23), we were dating for the past months. We are both scared of experiencing our first relationship, but he seemed since the beginning pretty sure about it (I was the one that wanted to slow down). Last week I decided to talk to him, I told him that I was ready and that I wanted a relationship. He replied that he has mixed feelings and prefers me as a friend, but he insisted that we stay in touch because I was special, that he really likes me‚Ä¶ in other words he really wants me as a friend. We have common friends, so I found out that he was really into me, that nobody had seen him so happy and open with a girl and that he hasn‚Äôt told anyone about our ‚Äúbreakup‚Äù, not even his best friend. 

When we were still dating the boy told me that his mother has cancer, that in the past he suffered a lot, but everything is fine now (he literally told me exactly these words) and avoided any further explanations. A few weeks ago he told me that he had to rush at the hospital because his mother had a surgery and had some complications afterwards (he didn‚Äôt told me about the surgery). He told me that everything went well, and that his mother could go home again, so I asked him for other info, I wanted him to talk about it. He replied that he didn‚Äôt knew anything else because de doesn‚Äôt want to know (about his mothers real conditions) and the discussion ended there. 

I suspect that he is terrorised about loosing his mother (as it should be), he refuses in anyway to face the problem, and he is suffering a lot about it. 

I know that we don‚Äôt know each other so well, so I can understand that he doesn‚Äôt want to talk with me, but still I want to be his friend and be there if he needs me. How can I help him? I think that he should learn how to face his mother illness, maybe go to a therapist, be open about it and be strong for his mother. This is such a delicate topic, I don‚Äôt know how to approach the problem and how to talk without hurting him, I don‚Äôt want to make things worse, but I can feel that he is suffering. What should I do? Should I mind my own business and go on with my life? Or I should push a bit, be patient and try to break his walls?

Thank you üòä",2019-11-14 18:58:58

She was doing well and got out of the hospital after one week.

Is this normal; one step forward and two steps back? She was supposed to be getting better since they took all the cancer out. I already have severe anxiety and I am freaking out. What is happening!? Did they miss some that was hiding or something? Did it move or mutate or whatever?

I also don‚Äôt want to come across offensive or anything in the fact that there hasn‚Äôt been an actual diagnosis. I understand that it might be ‚Äúok‚Äù. 

My mum had a traumatic brain injury which miraculously she survived and came out of as ‚Äúherself‚Äù after surgery and sedation/intensive care etc. She came home after weeks in hospital and went to her GP doctor who said on the notes from the hospital, they found a mass in her lung on the CT scan  of her brain (the scan covered her head and upper chest) so she has been urgently referred to the Robert Ogden Macmillan Cancer department at a hospital this Friday. 

I worry that 
1) they haven‚Äôt just sent her to the usual radiology department for another scan, they‚Äôve actually referred her to the cancer building on the hospital site. 
2) they‚Äôve technically seen this mass already on a CT scan that they would usually use to diagnose her? (I think) 
3) she has got some symptoms of lung cancer as she‚Äôs an ex smoker of 30+ years (but still smokes an e-cig) she has a constant cough and quite often gets a hoarse voice however she is also a functioning alcoholic, she doesn‚Äôt drink very often but will binge and I‚Äôm not sure if this is where the throat/voice problems come from. (Straight vodka definitely isn‚Äôt great for the throat) 

My question is, & I know it might be a question that can‚Äôt be answered but wondering about others experiences with diagnosis... if they scan her or whatever they‚Äôre gonna do on Friday and they see that it is in fact cancer, will they tell her that day? Or wait until her GP follow up appointment that is booked for the following Monday? Or does it have to be a biopsy? Or does the scan have to go away for a consultant to look at etc. Sorry my brain is in overdrive :( and I just don‚Äôt know what the process usually is. Just trying to prepare myself.

*another reason I worry (and what are the chances in this!!?) my parents are separated and I visited my dad at the weekend who told me that he on the same day as mum, has to go to the radiology department at his hospital for a lump that‚Äôs grown on his lower chest/stomach (he didn‚Äôt specify exactly where but it‚Äôs a lump he can physically feel) to rule out ‚Äúanything sinister‚Äù.

Over the last 18 months there have been ups and downs, but taking it day by day, trying to remain optimistic about the future. Over the last few months we have seen a steady decline in our brother in law. First the eye sight on one side was getting worse, then numbness on that side of his body. And now over the last two weeks he has gone from walking down stairs on his own to not being able to get out of bed with out someone supporting him. Watching him go through this is so hard. Seeing his two young boys watch their dad who was their biggest supporter/coach lose his mobility is so sad. Listening to my sister in law cry about it is heartbreaking.

Refuses to take any medication,3,9r81b4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/9r81b4/refuses_to_take_any_medication/,4,1540480504.0,"My boyfriend has been prescribed medication for severe anxiety and pain associated with his cancer. 

He has a thing about taking pills. He be hates taking them and flat out refuses to. Even though he's writhing in pain, sobbing crying on the floor he will not take pain pills. 

We talked to the doctor about his refusal to take pills and they put him on the fentanyl patch which has been working for him. They also gave him Gabapentin for nerve pain. Those only come in pills.
They prescribed him liquid Prozac for the anxiety, since he won't take pills and he still refuses to take it. I fought with his insurance company for two weeks to get him the liquid Prozac and he refuses. It's a medication that needs to be taken daily, he refuses to take it because he ""hasn't felt any anxiety today"".

I try over and over to explain to him why he needs to take the meds when he does but he gets angry and defensive. His doctors have explained on several occasions why and he nods along and agrees and tells his doctors of course he's going to take them. Then we get home and he refuses. He gets angry, defensive, tells me that he doesn't need medication because he's tired of having so much medicine in his body. He was just diagnosed with Spindle Cell Sarcoma a month ago. He's been on the meds for a month. He just started chemo today and his doctors AGAIN explained the importance of taking his meds and we got home and he refused. 

I am so incredibly frustrated because I have to fight him on everything regarding his medication. I have to fight him to put a new patch on every 3 days. I have to fight him to take the Prozac. I have to fight him to take his nerve pain medication. I have to fight him to take his nausea medication. I am so freaking tired of fighting him. 

It would be one thing if he didn't really need them. But he's unable to sleep due to panic attacks. He cries and writhes in pain constantly. He needs these medications to make his life livable and he keeps refusing. I've never forced him to take the medication, I know he has the right to refuse it but I can't sleep. He cries and yells all night long either from the pain or the anxiety and I am emotionally, physically exhausted.

I am tired of trying to help him just to be yelled at and insulted and made to feel like I'm abusing him. ",2018-10-25 15:15:04

We are from El Salvador, family of 5 sons, mother and father.

My brothers and I are all between 30 and 40.

My father got diagnosed with prostate cancer 5 years ago, treated him with chemo and got better but being the stubborn man he always was, he never went to his trimester check ups.
5 months ago he began having leg pains so we go to the doc and told us he had bone cancer.
We are all here for him, after all we are five grown sons with 3 grandchildren and 2 on the way. I feel frustrated because I am the only one living in Argentina and is currently on my second visit to El Salvador because of the disease, but we are new with this, everybody is having a hard time emotionally and economically as medicine in El Salvador is expensive and my dad doesn‚Äôt have healthcare.

Personally My biggest fear is not sealing my dad healthy again and having to see my mom struggling every day to see that he is without pain, taking care of him, taking care of her students, the money for the meds, the doctors appointments etc.

I am also married with a 3 yo so another fear of mine is that I have people to take care of and ara my priority... but my dad is also a priority...it‚Äôs so tough to balance things. Have a lot on my mind every time of the day.

One day at the doc, my mom saw another patient with a more advanced disease and never took this image out of her head of a lady so thin, her face looked like a skeleton. It was so shocking and constantly remembers her and starts to cry because she doesn‚Äôt want to see my dad like that.

Today I was seating with my dad and he told me the worst thing to him is feeling useless and not be able to do things. He wonders when he will get better, I don‚Äôt know what to say.

Sincerely I don‚Äôt know what I turned to reddit for this, I think I just don‚Äôt know what else to think, as a family we are losing low on money and all our lives have changed. Not to be selfish, is just that...maybe we were not prepared for this...no one never is prepared I think.

I just came here just to let off steam, because I don‚Äôt know where else to talk to people with similar situations. We are all so sad.

We are being strong for him, my mom is being strong for him, we need to be strong together.


Thanks for reading.

not sure how to support boyfriend whose mum is in palliative care for meta lung cancer when he's turning a bit on me,5,9j56hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/9j56hh/not_sure_how_to_support_boyfriend_whose_mum_is_in/,2,1538015544.0," 

Ultimately, I'm not sure how to support boyfriend whose mum is in palliative care for meta lung cancer when he's turning a bit on me

Boyfriend's mum was diagnosed with lung & meta bone cancer in the spring - they put her through chemo as wel as immunotherapy and as of about 1 month ago, the doctors let him and his sister know that she likely had days. She's still hanging on, but it's been very much ups and downs for them, still a constant diagnosis of days, and it's been obviously incredibly tough on him as he tries to navigate this with the rest of his life.

I've been doing what I can for him, as best as I can possibly come up with, and I think it's been helping. We don't live together, but I've basically been living there as the worst of things have happened to give him some company, to help ease the little annoying things (cleaning, sometimes making dinner, giving him massages, buying wine/beer, thinking of things to pick up for his mum that he mentioned,d that sort of thing). He's said it's helped, and I do genuinely believe that, but as he becomes more distant things have been getting tougher - something I expected to happen, but not in this way.

One of the the things we've been doing together that helps take his mind off things is play video games together (hey Skyrim hey). About a week ago, we were playing and he started to get very controlling in a not fun way. I'm usually very patient with him and do not ever get upset with him over things that I don't bring up in a calm way, but this particular instance it felt like he was purposely trying to nag at me and prod the beast that is my patience (later when we chatted, that was indeed the case), so I snapped back at him slightly. We apologized to each other and thought nothing of it, but the same thing happened the other day with a more intense reaction - he thought he was just having fun and didn't realize it came across to me the same as the first time. He got quiet and was clearly very upset, practically giving me the silent treatment for something I thought was fully justified.

Perhaps I should mention at this point that he's been self-medicating with alcohol and weed a lot lately. He normally uses both quite heavily (we share 2 bottles of wine a night on a regular basis), so this should go to show just how much he's been medicating. In addition, he has a problem with controlling his patience, and given everything going on he's at wit's end - I on the other hand am incredibly patient, making this a difficult situation for me to navigate. When I tried to address this second instance of snapping at him, he had already at this point been drinking and using weed (as had I). While we sat and chatted without raising voices, he basically asked if I thought that getting short with him while playing the silly video game ""was really fucking necessary"" and proceeded to talk about how he's going through a lot and that I need to understand he's not always going to be able to rein in the patience, and that he thought I understood this, thought that I would have more empathy, and that he's questioning my empathy now on a larger scale given that a video game is such a tiny thing and ""what might things be like in the real world as time goes on"".

While I understand completely where he's coming from about how much he's going through, I really felt that the comments about my empathy were completely unjustified and told him that I didn't think it was fair to have to just take moments where the frustration are directed at me rather than being allowed to protect myself, to defend myself. He got it, and we apologized, but he also made a comment about how right now he couldn't give two fucks about trying to rein in the patience, that sort of thing. I noted it, but thought no matter, let's move on.

The following day (yesterday) happened to be his birthday. As I left in the morning, things still felt a bit tense and I left feeling icky about the whole thing. The whole day I couldn't help thinking about the comment he made ""attacking"" my empathy, and I made up my mind to let him know that I was feeling that way later in the day, but that I would see things felt with us. Since things were actually quite good, I left it....but didn't want to go to bed with it still on my mind. We went to bed at 230, he had been drinking quite a bit and had had edibles as well, and I didn't realize he was as far gone as he was. I brought up how I was feeling, and he went 0-60 very quickly when he misunderstood my reason for bringing it up was just so he was aware of the fact that I had continued to think about our conversation throughout the day. He yelled at me, saying he doesn't need any more of this shit in his life, that his mother is dying, that I chose to bring this up on his birthday (he has told me multiple times he doesn't even like his birthday), that I was a complete asshole by making something like this about me, and wouldn't really let me explain myself that this was not what I had intended and I simply wanted to be transparent as we've been being throughout the relationship. When I apologized, he further yelled, and said that right now, ""your fucking feelings don't matter, you've just been an asshole throughout this entire thing, you don't matter right now."" We somehow came to a conclusion when he decided to ""give me a chance to right things"" and joined me back in bed (I had been prepared to leave and head home). Before we said goodnight, he said ""my life is my own, and the people I have in it are because I choose to have them there"" or something similar.

When I woke this morning, already I had the impression that he didn't remember - and he didn't. But he knew something was wrong, so asked me about it, at which point I started crying. We spent half an hour talking about what happened the night before because he couldn't remember and insisted, and when I expressed that I would rather leave it as I got the message, asked a few times why I brought it up this morning if I wanted to leave it (even though he had refused to let me go to work until I told him what had happened). When I finally did give an abridged version (as to not invoke his anger accidentally again) he apologized, but again reiterated that he's sensitive right now and that I just have to understand that he felt I was being a dick and that we need to agree to just not be assholes to each other over stupid little things. Not only that, but he said I needed to bring up the shit I'm feeling and tell him - of course exactly what I had tried to do the night before that ended up being a major mistake. I've certainly learned to not have discussions like this while he's not sober, but also I get the impression that even when I do bring things up he's going to get it in his head that it's just me being an asshole and that what I'm feeling or say don't really matter and that he's going to do what he wants without disregard for how I'm feeling that I'm trying to bring up.

I'm at the point where I've been doing everything in my power to support him, but this still isn't enough, and it's now at the point where he's beginning to using me as an outlet for his frustrations. This said, when he is using me as such, and I react as any person likely would and snap back, he vilifies me for ""not understanding his situation and appreciating what he's going through"" and saying things like right now I just have to accept that he just doesn't care about censoring himself right now, rather than understanding he's being unkind to me. I'm genuinely not sure if he knows he's being unkind, but he's blaming me for something he started in the first place and basically saying I'm not allowed to have the feelings I do and respond back because he doesn't need more shit to deal with in his life.

I love the man, and want to support him and will continue to do so, but I'm not sure how to make him see he's taking things out on me without just being told to grin and bear it. I'm an incredibly empathetic person, very patient, and I hate seeing him like this. But I am also someone who's experienced great depression in the past 10 years and only just have been developing confidence (largely thanks to him too) where I have the courage to stand up for things I feel are unjust towards me. All I'm trying to do is protect myself and make sure things don't get to the point where I'm basically being verbally abused. And he doesn't talk much about what's going on with his mum - he'll let me know what happened during the day when he comes home after being at the hospital, but it doesn't feel like he's letting himself be vulnerable around me (he's only cried once).

Does anyone have experience with this kind of reaction of someone who's a cancer patient caregiver?  A lot of what he says about what he's going through and how I need to be sensitive and very careful about that is true, but I really don't agree that I should entirely put aside my feelings and not bring things up if he's cruel to me (whether unbeknownst to him or not). I just don't know what to do, and I don't want this to be the thing that runs our relationship into the ground.",2018-09-27 02:32:24

Just getting everything out,4,8v8k17,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/8v8k17/just_getting_everything_out/,5,1530461664.0,"Sorry for bad grammar or anything like that,I‚Äôm not from the US.

So about six months ago, me and my best friend were just hanging out, when she told me that she went to the doctor because she had a slight pain in the kidney area and the doctor thinks it might be cancer in an early stage , I don‚Äôt remember the specific name, but she told me it‚Äôs a rare kind of cancer that is hard to deal with, because of the location of the tumor in the kidney. Long story short, she has four months to live.

Now, for context, at the time we were both 17, and her father was starting to recover from cancer after a lot of chemo.

The worst part of that story was that her family 
Doesn‚Äôt know, She wanted to wait until her father was healthy to tell everyone. 
I was a little hesitant about that, but I trusted her to tell them before it‚Äôs too late.
She was so afraid of everything that she skipped every test she had and didn‚Äôt want chemo.

Fast forward to maybe three or four months ago, She went to enough tests to make sure it was cancer, she had already told a couple more friends, but still not to her family.
I couldn‚Äôt just stand there and do nothing while my best friend was dying, From my point of view, her family deserved to know before me, It was really not right to not let them know.
So I was pushing her to tell them, maybe starting to go too far, our relationship started falling apart because of that, we started talking less and when we did talk most of the time it was about that.

Because she skipped almost every test in the beginning, she felt that something wasn‚Äôt right, she majored biology in high school so she knew enough to understand what her doctor was saying.
I don‚Äôt know enough to fully understand everything she said, but because she skipped most of the tests, there‚Äôs still a chance it is not cancer.

And now, two months after the time her doctor gave her, her family still doesn‚Äôt know, I still try go get her to talk to them, I‚Äôm worried she won‚Äôt tell them, they‚Äôre her family, they are way more important than me, and they deserve to know, I‚Äôm afraid that it would be too late for her to tell them. I know that I‚Äôm wrong about pushing her too much, and I‚Äôm the one that fucks up our relationship,but I feel like that the most important thing, thats the thing that matters the most .
And again, I feel like I have to at least try to do something.

Her 18th birthday is next week, and she plans to tell them after that.
Our relationship is in a slightly better place now, we had a little fight yesterday, but I feel like we‚Äôre in a better place because of that.

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm posting this, And I don‚Äôt know what to expect, but thanks for reading this.

"Six months ago, she had a weird lump in her back. Yesterday, I was told that they‚Äôre moving toward hospice.",3,7rq8ec,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/7rq8ec/six_months_ago_she_had_a_weird_lump_in_her_back/,2,1516481780.0,"I will start out by saying this post is not about me, but cancer affects everybody who loves someone with it. It punches you in the heart and then twists it like an ex-lover, but deeper.

My cousin‚Äôs wife pointed out a weird lump on her back over the summer. She has been a beloved member of our family for nearly 20 years, and I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôll get to see her 40th birthday, let alone next Tuesday. 

They have 4 kids: ages 16 to 4 years old. Money has always been tight for them, so they waited until they could get her insured to get it checked out. 

She was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, and the family learned about it in August 2017. I learned about it in September. Her father is a chemo doc, so she chose to be treated at his hospital. Nothing has worked, and the cancer has spread. She‚Äôs just been deteriorating at a rapid pace. She was already a tiny 110, and is now 72 pounds, maybe less. She needed a massive amount of steroids just to be with the family at Christmas Eve. 

Since the news broke, we‚Äôve all been under strict orders from her immediate family not to post on Facebook about it and not to message her about it. I do have to respect my cousin and his family‚Äôs wishes, as well as his wife‚Äôs family‚Äôs wishes. That‚Äôs where it‚Äôs so frustrating. I don‚Äôt know what to do to help. 

I can‚Äôt contact her to just tell her how amazing she has been, raising those 4 kids with a smile on her face and a heart of gold. She‚Äôs sleeping for 3 days at a time. I also don‚Äôt want to stress her out. 

It‚Äôs different when you find out somebody is sick(Get well! See you on Monday!), or somebody is dying(...my predicament), or that somebody is dead(He/she was amazing, even though they won‚Äôt be here on this astral plane to hear me tell them!), It‚Äôs also quite different given their stages of life or the magnitude of their suffering. 

When you find out a loved one has early-detected cancer, you freak out, take a few deep breaths, and then say ‚ÄúOK. How are we going to fight this?‚Äù When you find out a loved one has Stage 4 out of nowhere, You go through a plethora of emotions. Mostly anger, at how cancer doesn‚Äôt discriminate between good or bad people. Cancer descended upon a very good person. She deserves so much better! 

You know the feeling you get when you see a missed call from a family member, and you listen to the voicemail, and you can hear the sadness in their voice just saying ‚ÄúHey, please give me a call back when you get a chance‚Äù? I thought ‚ÄúOh, F**k no. Oh God. She‚Äôs gone.‚Äù Well, Dad had to be part of the calling tree to tell me that her doctors advised to stop feeding her, and to move her to hospice care. 

She has an appointment with a cancer center for a second opinion on Monday, but we‚Äôre all afraid it‚Äôs much too late. That doesn‚Äôt mean that we aren‚Äôt praying for a miracle. I WANT that miracle more than anything in the world. We find out on Monday if there is any bit of hope. 

Optimism and realism are clashing into a sea of prayers and tears amongst our family. Prepare for the worst, and hope for the best.

I want so badly to reach out, to tell her how much all of us love her and care about her; how she‚Äôs impacted our lives. I feel like she‚Äôs been barricaded from everyone. 

I‚Äôm scared, and I‚Äôm sad. I can‚Äôt imagine WTF she is going through.

In his words it's extremely treatable and he gave me a big hopeful number of years of how long he has left, but at that point my ears were ringing too loudly to really hear him. 

This just sucks so much, he sounds hopeful but I'm just dreading he's going to feel going through chemo, I have no idea what that's going to be like. He's a tough dude and he's beat cancer before just.... it really feels like my childhood is officially dead. I feel selfish but I lost my grandmother in November and I've been working myself to the bone at a shitty trade school and now I have to carry on with the knowledge that my sweet, loving dad has cancer. Out of all the people on this planet who deserve it... fuck.

On 10/13/2020 I lost my beautiful, strong, and the most amazing lady in my life. She was battling stage 4  colon cancer for 3 almost 4 years and never gave up. I mean this lady fought till her last breathe. And once she passed she had the biggest smile on her face. I‚Äôve  heard such amazing stories about my mom after she passed, visiting her loved one in their dreams.

God works in mysterious ways, I was blessed and I‚Äôm extremely grateful I was able to spend the last 3 days with her in the hospital along with my sisters and dad.

It breaks my heart I won‚Äôt have the motherly love my mom gave me anymore, I‚Äôm only 20 years old and I can‚Äôt even imagine life without her 5 years from now. There‚Äôs days I cry and there‚Äôs times where I‚Äôm trying to keep going but manage to always breakdown after holding it in. I feel crazy, but I also don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready to accept my mom is gone. It seems as if she hasn‚Äôt responded to my messages because she‚Äôs been busy. I want to her back guys, It‚Äôs not the same without my mom here. I‚Äôve watched my mom fight her cancer for so long and deserves to be pain free, I just always wonder what would life have been without her being diagnose. She didn‚Äôt deserve all the pain. She didn‚Äôt deserve any of this. I miss her every hour, every minute, and every second of the day.",2020-11-05 02:51:15

"Struggling, don't know if I should avoid my dad? Anyone deal with angry loved ones with cancer?",3,jjyy8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/jjyy8z/struggling_dont_know_if_i_should_avoid_my_dad/,15,1603956539.0,"I believe I've posted here about my dad already once a few weeks ago.

Things have gotten worse and I don't know if the cancer he has is actually beatable like my family originally thought. So far, all we have is speculation courtesy of the doctors keeping their lips tightly shut. All they managed to say was that yes, he has cancer. They haven't said what kind yet (with the exception of one \[not the normal GP my dad sees\] guessing it could be something like bone cancer; some other kind of cancer, etc). They also haven't been helpful when it comes to kicking the oncologist in the ass; since they should've called us already some time ago. We're stuck with a shitty governmental one. We don't really know how to 100% contact this said oncologist (since the GP doc keep the info on the computer). Nobody's offering any help when it comes to treatment, since he hasn't seen an oncologist yet. I feel like by the time the oncologist thinks of us, he'll be fucking dead.

He possibly has more issues than any of us thought. An example of this is the fact his gut actually hasn't disappeared. He's lost 20 pounds (due to not eating) and is actually close to where he should be (ideal weight/height ratio wise). His gut should actually be gone; but his gut is still the same (think beer gut style; without the beer). So he might already have a tumor in his stomach. They're also worried about lung involvement, since he's been having trouble breathing particularly as of late. While his breathing already wasn't good (courtesy of COPD), it's gotten worse. 

I'm admittedly stressed out due to this and a little more sensitive. Everything hurts a little extra. I was already a super sensitive person before this whole thing; now I'm even more super sensitive (which I didn't even know was possible since I thought I was already at max sensitive mode). 

This is a problem, since my dad's in pain. His lower back is essentially obliterated for all intents and purposes (since they saw one vertebrae literally gone; one fractured and a few others that were equally fucked up). So naturally, he's a grouchy, super depressed and angrier since he's been in agony like this for nearly a year. I imagine his anger's originating from the depression (especially since my dad's had shit luck for these past few year and he thinks he's pretty much a dead man walking \[and he may be right or wrong \[it'd help if the oncologist fucking CALLED to confirm or deny that he's a dead man walking\]).

This doesn't help, since I'm already a crybaby by nature. I know he's literally not in his right state of mind (since I imagine he's stressed to the most possible max any human can be \[courtesy of not even knowing if he'll survive or not\] + in agony, since the pain meds seem to only help about 50% of the time). So I try not to take things too personally, but it's nearly impossible for me.   


I still take every little edgy and mean comment he says to heart. I can't help it, as much as I wish I could. It's making me wonder if I should avoid him possibly or not. I don't really want to bring up the fact he hurt my feelings yet again (since it's over something I consider super stupid). But I want to spend as much time with him as possible like I always have. I already know my parents aren't going to be around forever (due to cancer or some other unforeseeable event \[at this rate I'm just waiting for a meteor to hit us all since our luck's been just that shitty for the past few years\]). I want to make as many happy memories with them while I can. But it's hard if I'm constantly feeling hurt by every little mean comment he says.",2020-10-29 07:28:59

My husband and me just found out that my sister in law has breast cancer and started chemo a few weeks ago. 
She seems so strong and she says she is optimistic. She doesn't want to be treated any differently and doesn't want us to be worried about her.  She says ""good vibes only"". 

She is my favorite person of my husband's family and I am crushed because we live in Europe and they live in Canada and I feel so useless. Cancer runs in her family and she has lost a few family members to cancer already so that worries me even more. 
I would love to be able to cook for her or watch her children or anything but obviously I can't from so far away. Due to coronavirus our country is in lockdown again and travelling is also not an option. 

I was wondering if anyone has an idea on how we can still show support from far away? The best thing I could come up with so far was ordering food for them... I don't really know if that's a good idea though.

I'm sure everyone here knows cancer is anything but fun, and the months leading to, during and after his surgery were some of the worst in our lives. 

Initially, his toe had to be partially amputated; he recovered well. Then the blood tests came out bad, he needed to get his PET scan done. PET comes back with no organs affected but yes some lymph nodes from his leg, which meant he needed to go to surgery.

About three weeks later (I'm talking july now, after all the tests and back and forth) the surgery takes place. Since it was in another city, I was by myself for +1 month taking care of the pets and the house. 

He came back in August and I'm so thankful and happy to say that he is cancer free, he is taking meds that reduce the chances of it reappearing by 70% and while he is dealing with lymphedema which is quite common, it feels we are mildly out of the woods for the first time since I first heard the words ""cancer"". Althought I imagine you also know with cancer it's never really over.

The reason I'm writing today is because I have been struggling for about 3 months with eating - specifically, I can't eat anything except very soft foods and yogurt. I've lost a lot of weight and I'm seeing doctors about it to rule out a physical condition, but talking to my psychologist I'm starting to wonder if I've been bottling up feelings that manifested into this physical symptom.

I do realize amongst the chaos that was this year - pandemic, cancer AND also moving cities and quitting my job - I might have neglected myself because I needed to act. I didn't really sit down to think or allowed myself to feel because there was so much to be done. I remember that being one of the first things I thought - I need to learn how to drive so I can help. 

When my psychologist brought it up and I think about it, I do feel a whirlwind of emotions bubbling up. I realize that while I have felt overwhelming sadness, I never really took time to cry. I only cried during his surgery because of how scared I was.

What I wanted to ask you all is if you have lived through something similar. Perhaps not with the same physical manifestation, but yes neglecting your feelings because you needed to fight cancer first and everything it destroys. 

Writing about it alone has made me feel a bit better, and I'd love to hear if you have any advice to share from your own experiences. I'm also wishing you the best and sending a tight hug if you're here because a family member or yourself are suffering from cancer.",2020-10-16 07:18:07

I live with my parents and sister, along with my twin girls. I'm a single mom, although my boyfriend is an incredible help when he's here 2-3 times a week. I also work full-time. My job isn't the easiest, and it can be physically draining. Some days I have to take my girls to and from the babysitters' house, but even if I don't, I still struggle to stay on top of everything.

My mom usually ends up having to repeatedly ask me to do certain things. I feel so guilty, because sometimes I do procrastinate (ADD and anxiety are a bitch), but other times it's because I'm so exhausted and have so much pain. It's gotten to the point where, even though I love my job, I might have to find something else less physically taxing. It would break my heart. I love my coworkers, customers, even the work itself. I'm also taking a part-time course for my dream career, which would lead to me being able to take my certification test, which would give me a huge boost up if I pass it. I mention this because my current job is giving me great experience in my desired field, which would make it even harder to give up.

Anyways, all of this is crushing me. I do take medication for ADD, anxiety, and depression. I have BPD as well. So I keep finding myself lashing out at people, even if they weren't meaning anything offensive, because I sometimes misinterpret things or I'm simply at my wit's end. I have to keep it all together, I feel like I don't even have room to properly deal with my grief over my mom's diagnosis, otherwise I really won't be able to do what I need to do. My life has become agonizing, and my mental health is deteriorating. I had to grow up fast, I was already struggling to cope with so many life changes so quickly. I became pregnant with my girls at 21, gave birth without a c-section at 22. Now, I'm almost 24, trying to keep up with two extremely active 17 month olds, while trying to support the rest of my family. 

I'm sorry if this is all over the place, it's been a really hard day, and I've run out of ideas on how to cope. I do have a therapist, but I barely have free time as it is. I've just started to clam up, because I'm tired of hearing ""you just have to be strong"" and ""it'll be okay, you have to stop being so negative."" This is mostly a rant, but I needed to vent in a place where people are more likely to understand my situation and possibly be more empathetic. Would love advice as well, especially on getting through the day, and keeping emotions under control when they need to be.

Edit: TLDR; My mom has Stage IV appendix/renal cancer, and I'm a single mom with various health struggles that's hardly able to do the bare minimum at home.

Edit #2: For anyone that saw my post about my mom getting a CT scan done, they found that her tumors have been diminishing, and she'll be going to a hospital a few hours away to be evaluated for surgery in the near future. However, her red blood cell counts are now down.",2020-10-08 02:29:28

I hardly EVER feel anger... but right now I just feel like I‚Äôll never be able to look at my dad the same, if I‚Äôll even be able to look at him at all. 

I guess right now I‚Äôm just asking for some encouragement, BECAUSE THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST THING IVE EVER EXPERIENCED AND I WOULDN‚ÄôT WISH THIS ON MY WORST ENEMY.

She has smoked for at least as long as my sister and I have been alive.  At least 40 years.  They found spots on her lungs and one on her kidney.  They said the spot on the kidney may be a cyst, which apparently is not uncommon.  She also has a lump on her lower back.  According to the internet, that's not a good sign when it comes along with a spot on your kidney.   My son had issues when he was born and I learned two things.  1.  Stay off the internet.  2. Don't worry until you have something to worry about.  I am trying to remember those two things.

Today we have out first consultation to find out what all these spots are and what will happen going forward.

I am terrified.  My dad died when I was 11 from colon cancer. My mom never remarried.  She dedicated her entire life to my sister and me.  She also spent way to much time and worry on her job.  She is retiring in two weeks.  Thank god.

In June my mother-in-law (85yo) was diagnosed with esophageal cancer.  Her condition was deteriorating so my wife went back to the US in August to be with her. Due to COVID, my wife needed to quarantine for 2 weeks and then demonstrate a negative COVID test before she could see her. The day my wife‚Äôs test came back negative, her mother was hospitalized for dehydration and placement of a feeding tube. Due to COVID concerns, my wife was not allowed to visit her in the hospital. My wife has since been at her parent‚Äôs house taking care of her dad (93yo) who has early Parkinson‚Äôs disease. My MIL was finally able to come home from the hospital this past Friday -  she wants to get her affairs in order then have the feeding tube removed and then go into hospice care. It‚Äôs unclear long she will live without the support of the feeding tube. 


Since she left, my wife has not been communicating very well with me aside from a few text messages every day ( She has never been one to chat very much on the phone). I feel like I really need to pry her for information and her responses are short.  Last night I called her just before going to bed (there is a 2 hour time difference). I just wanted to talk and see how she was doing but she began to ask me to do a bunch of things and I told her I was going to bed and  would do them first thing in the morning. She started crying and became angry and hung up. I then received a text saying more of the same along with telling me that I was insensitive and have no idea what she is dealing with.

At that time we didn't know the stage or prognosis it was scary not knowing. It was an emotional rollercoaster to say the least. Then several weeks later after a CT scan, we were told it was  stage 2/3 adenocarcinoma because it had been found in two of his nearby lymph nodes. I thought okay that's not so bad. The team of doctors said 5 days of radiation and then chemo once a week until surgery. Well then another week goes by my dad has his endoscopic ultrasound to see the tumor depth. They find the tumor has grown through into outer muscle of his esophagus. 

 Two weeks ago on my birthday I get a text with results from my dad's ultrasound, my  mom says his cancer has been restaged to a 4! WTF?!  This time I am balling my eyes out. My dad's team of doctors adjust his treatment plan accordingly, 28 days of radiation plus one day of chemo per week for three hours. Then 6 weeks of rest and surgery in December. My dad goes to an appointment to talk about the surgery with his thoracic surgeon, he gets another bomb shell,  they are going to completely remove his esophagus and move his stomach up to basically take it's place. Two weeks in the hospital. He is already having difficulty swallowing and is eating less as a result. My mom has already modified his diet to fit with his eating issues and his loosing his will to eat because it is difficult for him. He cannot loose a drastic amount of weight. His doctors need him to eat to keep up his strength to make it through chemo and radiation.

 Today he started his treatment. I honestly wish they had started it weeks ago. I am scared he will not want to keep fighting especially when the chemo and radiation side effects kick in. They say everyone is different in how their bodies handle it. I pray my dad is strong enough and stubborn enough to push through the difficult days that will come.  I am grateful that my dad has a huge amount of support from his family. My aunt came to stay with mom to help her out when my dad starts to get sick from his treatments. This is easing my mind a bit that my mom has help and support when I can't be there because I live pretty far away. But now the battle has begun and I need my dad to step up to the plate and fight.

First time posting here.
I'm 24 years old, and I discovered 3 years ago my grandfather had cancer. He went through the chemo treatments and for a while he was cancer free. The cancer in particular is Folliculer Lymphoma. He's quiet about it, but what I do know is that it's in his hair follicles on his head. 
Just this year it came back. So tomorrow he is being admitted to the hospital for 2 months to go  through stem cell removal, then strong chemo. And then those stem cells put back and more strong chemo. It's a 99.5% success rate. But I have anxiety, and all I think about is that .5% and it's tough. I know I have so many positives placed before me but all I see are the negatives.
I'm honestly not sure if I'm looking for advice or just need to get this off my chest. But this really is a breath of fresh air. The months to come will be difficult but I can only hope they are successful.
Much love and support to you all!",2020-09-09 15:16:14

On to my post. My mom was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer in January. It has been a whirlwind since. Between hospital stays, finding other issues and covid, 2020 has been a great year.

My parents and I have a strained relationship. My Dad worked nights my entire childhood and wasn‚Äôt around for a lot of life lessons. My Mom did everything right, but was never the type to accept the faults she had. When she was diagnosed, I was not told officially until two weeks after her initial diagnosis. Even though I already knew from hearing from the doctors and being able to put 2 and 2 together. I.e the floor she was on in the hospital. Who her doctor was and what their specialty was. Gotta love the internet. My family for whatever reason does not share info real well. Both of my parents want to keep everything close to chest. Which I totally understand wanting to keep things private but neither one of them have a real strong support group to lean on. Believe me, I‚Äôve tried. Two weeks ago, I believe Mom had a stroke. The last few visits, she‚Äôs barely acknowledged me and my daughter being there and is pretty much nonverbal. She‚Äôs able to say a yes/no but that‚Äôs about it. Since all this began in January, I‚Äôve been locked out from meetings with doctors, I haven‚Äôt been able to take her to treatments or just been able to be there. I call and text almost daily.

So this past week my (22F) mom (54) found out she has Stage 2 cervical cancer. She told me she might need a major operation and that she's looking for a doctor with my step-dad (67). She hopes to have the operation ASAP.

I guess I just don't really know how to react. I understand my mom feels stressed right now, considering there's a pandemic and all. She's also scared I think. I don't know. I don't have the closest relationship with my mom, so we don't normally open up to each other at all. I don't want to ask her much because I don't want to add to her stress, and also because she tends to take out her frustrations on people sometimes. 

I know I should probably be there for her but I just don't know how to be. My mom raised me on her own. As much as I understand now that she couldn't be there for me much growing up because she had to work to support me and my older brother, I haven't let go of my resentment towards her. I know she did her best, and it's not like she was absent, but when I felt like I needed my mom as a ""friend"", she was never there.

My dad, who I know did nothing to financially support me or my brother, became the ""friend"" parent I was looking for growing up. Although I also don't have a very close relationship with my dad, he is someone I would go to when I decide to open up to a parent and look for advice.

I guess I've been walking on eggshells around my mom for years now, and my mom has told me as well that she feels the same. Even knowing this, we can't seem to get close, and I find it difficult to open up and be honest with my mom.

Right now, I just feel really awkward, and I don't know what to do. Should I ask how she's feeling? Should I try to help out? She actually asked me to be in charge of meal planning for me and my step-dad because after the operation I know she won't be able to move around the house much. I just said okay, but to be honest, I thought of maybe just staying with my dad for a while by then so I'm not around the house so she doesn't need to think about me. But that thought seems wrong, like maybe I should be here with her but I just don't know how to. Again, I just feel awkward

This pandemic hasn't helped me much mentally as well, but I don't want to get into too much detail about how I feel about my personal future. I just want to try and be there for my mom but I don't know how.",2020-08-26 01:40:07

This is probably going to be all over the place but it makes me feel better to hope that someone feels like reading all this. I apologize also if the punctuation and/or grammar isn‚Äôt on par.

My dad (66) and I (21 F) have never had the most ideal relationship. He suffered significant emotional, physical, and mental abuse from his parents his entire life and despite being nothing like him towards us, his temper and abusive words and tendencies have created tension and issues between us for years now to the point where I don‚Äôt really have conversations with him unless we both happen to be home or I need money for something (unfortunately). I can only imagine what he had to deal with during his child-adulthood living with them when he had because he still has very much open wounds from the treatment. He‚Äôs very stuck in his own ways and has a very ‚Äúmy way of the highway‚Äù attitude about literally anything. He‚Äôs been verbally and physically abusive towards my siblings and mom to the point where the cops have had to be called several times in the past, is extremely sensitive, and doesn‚Äôt like any kind of disrespect whether it‚Äôs intentional or not. In short, my relationship has been quite strained with him and my siblings and I generally rely on our mom for every other parental support. With all of that being said though, I wouldn‚Äôt trade him for anyone in the world. He‚Äôs extremely smart and was a very successful physician in his earlier years. Ironically though he has a very large distaste for the healthcare world as a whole. 

He was diagnosed with colon cancer in June of 2018 but unbeknownst to all of us, he‚Äôd actually had the tumor for well over 2 years before he bothered look further into what was going on. Up until May of 2020, other than counting for the days where he‚Äôd spend the days sleeping off his chemo and radiation treatments, he was fine. To us at least. He‚Äôd still run errands, drive himself around, handle all of the big bills in the house, he was working...And then he had the surgery. 

Almost immediately (the evening he got out of the surgery) it was clear my dad wasn‚Äôt prepared for the realistic recovery time from this operation. He‚Äôd never been operated on before and this was a 6 hour surgery to have a temporary Colostomy bag placed on him that we‚Äôd hoped would be removed in another 3 months after the surgery, things didn‚Äôt go as planned though. He was only supposed to be in the hospital for 4 days tops but he ended up being there 3 weeks, this is early June now because his surgery was on the 11th of May. When he finally came home the weight loss was very hard to miss. He‚Äôd gone from 185 lbs to what looked like 160, and my dads 5‚Äô10 so it was eerily noticeable. He only continued losing the weight after the fact.

Fast forward to July, he still hasn‚Äôt walked, is barely eating or even drinking, and my mom has become his primary care taker; feeding him, bathing him, sleeping on the couch to not have to disturb him but to still be able to hear him if he needs water or something, just everything. He‚Äôs now closer to 140 lbs and slowly losing more and more mobility and energy with every day he decides not to eat. He‚Äôs throwing up bile and blood, getting mini looking seizures, and had developed diabetes but hadn‚Äôt been taking his meds. He‚Äôd slipped into a full on depression and had pretty much given up on himself (he‚Äôs always struggled with on and off depression) while also refusing to get medical care. At this point it‚Äôs hard even coming upstairs to say hi or ask if he needs anything because the person I‚Äôm seeing and attempting to talk to looks nothing like the man that has watched me grow up.. he finally agreed to being taken to the hospital though on the 14th and since then there‚Äôs been slight improvements but not much. 

I went to see him in the hospital the 16th and the entire time all I could do was get him water when he asked, answer his random questions or statements that‚Äôd often have nothing to do with what was going on, and cry silently as I watched him writhe in pain and shake as he tried drinking his own water. It was only when I was about to leave when he looked at me, smiled, and told me how beautiful I‚Äôd grown up to be. I‚Äôm crying as I type this now because that‚Äôs probably the first and only time I‚Äôll ever hear him say that... It hurts seeing him in pain and knowing there‚Äôs nothing I can do to reverse time and take away this fucking disease, it hurts feeling like I‚Äôm probably going to walk down the aisle without him when I‚Äôm married, it hurts envisioning his absence at my graduation, it hurts knowing he probably won‚Äôt be able to be repaid for all he‚Äôs done for me and taught me... I can‚Äôt even think about how my mom has been able to handle everything. The last update I heard his BP is low enough for him to slip into hypertension and possibly a coma and that his tumor has now metastasized to his liver. I‚Äôm terrified of losing my dad... I can‚Äôt deal with this pain.",2020-08-19 17:19:40
Help with Cold Sensitivity,3,i7w1cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/i7w1cu/help_with_cold_sensitivity/,5,1597195824.0,"Hello fellow comrades! 

My mother was diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer in May and is now undergoing her 5th round of chemotherapy and taking it like a champ! 

First off, I don‚Äôt want to brag, but she hasn‚Äôt lost any weight and is going to work every week between treatments which is absolutely astonishing. Those little victories don‚Äôt mean much to others, and sometimes they don‚Äôt mean much to her, but they give me hope and almost make me cry out of joy at the end of the day. 

As many of you likely know, chemo‚Äôs a bitch. 
We‚Äôve been able to handle most side effects pretty well, and the nausea hasn‚Äôt even been terrible. The cold sensitivity, however, is in full swing. 

We opted for the Folfirinox protocol, which involves a 5-hour infusion at the clinic, plus a 46-hour infusion with a pump we can take home. 

She says anytime she touches cold things, that she feels a jolt of electricity, like sticking your finger in a socket. Usually this goes away a day or two after finishing the infusion, but has been much more severe this time around. She can‚Äôt use silverware, or open the fridge on her own because it hurts so much. 

So here I ask for your help. Has anyone had any experience with cold sensitivity? Any recommendations or tips on how to handle it? We bought thin cotton gloves for her to wear around the house but I can see some things will get harder (like flushing the toilet!). Any help and tips are appreciated!


Thank you for your help, and keep on going! Just one more day can make all the difference. You are stronger than you know!",2020-08-12 01:30:24

I didn't have much of a relationship with him and my siblings.. my mum kept me away and fed me crap about him. Said he didn't care or want to see me. Meanwhile we moved 85 times in my first 20 years, so he most often didn't know my location. I have no idea how long I have left to establish a relationship and 'make up for lost time' or at least create some new memories full of love. We talked and he apologised and I truly forgave

 I think I'm fine with it, but I've had to put dealing with it in a queue.. 

I've had my very ill Grandmother in hospital for 2 weeks, I was with her 40 hours last week through admission through to procedures and complications and ""recovery"" aka doctors had to make the call to send her home as it was as good as it will get (her heart, lungs, bowel, bladder, kidney, liver). 

My aunt had heart surgery and us taking a while to recover.. I'm still worried about her.

My mum has chosen this shitty time to cut me off.... she is a narcissistic so and so. 

I supported my bestie through a court case.. it was traumatic. Now she is staying with me and we are letting loose...Yes I am quite drunk right now. But speaking the truth.

Advice and supportive comments will be happily accepted. I don't know how to begin to process I'm going to lose my dad and I'm yet to build a real relationship with him.

I don‚Äôt know what to do myself. I know I should feel lucky that I will get to say goodbye, but right now I just feel angry and sad.

i bring her to chemo appointments. set up everything. insurance. doctors. lawyers. driving. groceries. etc...so i feel exhausted. i havent left my bed in maybe 3 days very much. depression is rubbing off on each other.

tips appreciated.  ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. she just told me to get out of the house if i keep acting like this (depressed), that she doesnt want me here, i guess out of kindness and upset-ness. that shell just take care of herself. that she will kick me out. i mean its important for her not to get upset, as it flares her pain, but she gets upset rather easily. i try to just follow her rules. but its so many rules. lol. our language barrier brings frustrations too. so even communicating can be stressful. there are no other caregivers. i have no where to go except my dad's. my mom gets lonely and depressed if left by herself too long. she cant handle appointments and doesnt even drive at this point because it has always stressed her out. i cant just leave her. it just doesnt make sense.

i get the sense that her issues w anger probably caused her cancer, to some extent...actually it makes a lot of sense...maybe. if her flare ups caused gastro-intestinal issues, and it happened often, it could have been the start of chronic infection related to gallbladder cancer...

feels really sad:(...................................

just need to figure out how to have self-care time while living in close quarters...i dont want to take emotional beatings, not say anything, and feel resentful, have anger bubble up. at the same time, dont want to piss her off too much by addressing it either without ability to just let it go myself. lol. seems kinda hard to do neither.",2020-07-24 08:47:33

My mom was just diagnosed with stage 4 cancer 2 or 3 weeks ago, most likely endometrial. It has spread to her liver and spine and there is no treatment she qualifies for. The doctor told us she most likely has 3 or less months to live - I read that usually these prognosis‚Äô are overestimated and now I can‚Äôt cope. We didn‚Äôt have a perfect relationship and I used to fight with her more times than I can count. I was always very irritated with her for some reason, especially when she became ill. I was angry that I had to pause my life and I was angry that no one else in my family (my father and only sibling) wouldn‚Äôt help. The rest of our family lives in a different country so I was alone for months until I finally took her to the hospital and she was diagnosed. I am full of guilt because of my carelessness and ignorance - if I had taken her to the hospital earlier she might have gotten treatment. It‚Äôs been 3 weeks since she‚Äôs been at the hospital and due to COVID, only I am allowed in because I can translate for her and can communicate her symptoms best.

I'm 24. Graduated from college Dec 2019 and a bit directionless. I wanted to drift and find my way traveling and meeting people while seeing what life had in store for me as I formed a path of my own; I already was doing a bit of this in practice but never formally left my hometown or my parents and was in the process when corona hit and I quarantined with mom. She was suddenly diagnosed early last month with stage 4 gallbladder cancer. I am here with her as her primary caretaker now and there is little else family who would properly step in. So, I see myself here for the foreseeable future. There does not seem to be the option of a nursing home. She does not currently qualify for disability aid, as her work credits don't qualify her.

I am fine with being her caretaker, though should the end of her life be near, I am afraid, too, about witnessing her pain by myself and caring for myself emotionally. There is family, but I don't feel comfortably dependent on them enough to really reach out or be received emotionally...we aren't that close is all.

Anyway,

as it is with cancer, we just don't know what the heck a timeline is! I know the percentages. I've looked at them. We have not been given a timeline. The doctor said, in an optimistic tone, ""You may even have a year!"" Lol. Somewhat, this is longer than I had anticipated, and took with gratitude. But a year isn't promised. I understand she may even be alive for longer.

I just don't quite understand how to plan and live my life as an adult, while I am caring for her at this stage. I feel like she will be the center of my life, this cancer will be, maybe? you know? I don't know how soon it will come or how much further in the future it will be either...I am directionless, careerless, relationship-less (save for a few wonderful friends who are long-distance).

I want to start to pave a direction--but even that seems strange and out of place? I can compartmentalize the space of time to begin my own journey, while assisting her and caring for her--but starting grad school or taking classes at a time like this seems strange, too. Doing most anything seems strange independent from the situation.

I'm not making any money! It's not necessarily a big issue for us, right now...but I feel I'd like to be on my own two feet, somewhat, before she leaves me...so i can get a feel for it? know that i can do it? you know? i will receive an inheritance, and there shouldn't be too much worry...but...i want to grow into my own...know that i am solid. that i am well enough to feel the weight of the world when she goes, or whatever it is.

I have thought about writing a few articles to post and begin a writing portfolio, though. :) There is enough quiet time for that!

But, again, it seems like many things ""should"" be on hold? Or I don't quite know how to work in my life and our life together...when I am in a transitional state entering adulthood (I was a very timid one:)) and quite isolated. and experiencing waves of grief, and anticipate i will likely go through heavier grief later down the road. Dunno. i dunno. dunno!. dunno!

What do you all think? How have you navigated this? Anything you might have to say is greatly appreciated for your time and effort to support me:)

It was an overwhelming three weeks and we were trying to figure out if we could make us work again. Then all this happened with his dad. I figured talks of us wouldn't be a priority for a while which is obviously fine and understandable. I just want to be there for him and his family and support him however I can. His family doesn't know that we've been talking though. A few days ago he told me he can't get attached to me. I asked if he wanted me out of his life and he said yes but I could call him every few days to check on him. I'm more than happy to do that because I do love him and want to give him whatever support I can. 

I just feel so alone. It may seem selfish but when we were together his dad was like a dad to me. I'm so sad about this diagnosis. Already I was on the outside, unable to do anything to help because his parents didn't know I was kind of back in his life. But now, even more so, I'm on the outside. I can't even talk to him daily.

I'm also hurt that he doesn't want me in his life to help deal with everything. I know that's less important considering the gravity of his dad's cancer, but it's just so confusing. Why wouldn't someone want love and support? Even if it is from an ex? We both love each other. There are just complications surrounding our relationship. So why would he push me away? 

I feel very selfish feeling all of this. But I also feel like I have no one to talk to and I don't know how to deal with this.

Now she‚Äôs in hospice. She‚Äôs 59 and will be leaving my youngest sister (18) and me and my other sister behind.

It‚Äôs never mentioned, never questioned. There is 0 other family either.

I want to ask my Mum about her father but how?
I‚Äôm scared ill traumatise her or something as it‚Äôs never ever mentioned ever.

But... when my sister asks one day she can‚Äôt ask anyone can she?

I‚Äôve searched the memory boxes (I had to finish putting them together :( ) and the will and wishes etc. Everywhere a letter could be.

So I‚Äôm asking: has anyone had to do this? When should I? We can visit now and keep distance but we live 3 hours away so visiting is weekly with our little one. 

Could I ask a counsellor at the hospice to speak to her?
I think I want it in writing so I can keep it and if my sister asks, she has that.

I sort of don‚Äôt want to know if it‚Äôs bad?

Any advice would be so appreciated x",2020-07-05 05:53:15
Radiotherapy,3,hl0wdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/hl0wdc/radiotherapy/,2,1593885435.0,"I have posted in here once before but didn‚Äôt get any responses. Second time lucky maybe?

An elderly relative had been diagnosed as stage 3 laryngeal cancer. After further biopsies and investigations it‚Äôs actually spread into the oesophagus. So now we are at stage 4. 

Due to previous medical history, their age and how quickly it is advancing- surgery is not an option. 

An MDT meeting is being held on Monday to determine the next course of action; curative radiotherapy or palliative radiotherapy. At this stage the width of the tumour has increased by double the size in 3 weeks. Radiotherapy of either kind wont be starting until around 3-4 weeks after Monday. 

If it‚Äôs growing and spreading rapidly, is this not too long to wait? 

Also, he is currently in hospital for a few more examinations and to try to get his pain controlled but he will be getting discharged home on Monday. I‚Äôve asked about a social work referral or something to get some assistance at home, not in the form of carers but rather aids to make life easier (bathroom is down stairs, bedrooms are up stairs, there is only a bath in the house which he struggles to get in/out of etc) but this won‚Äôt be arranged until after he gets discharged. Just wondering what the turnaround timeframe for some kind of assessment would be?

I'm new to all this so forgive me if I'm not as articulate as need be. In September my mother \[63\] was diagnosed with Cancer of Unknown Primary after doctors found cancer in her liver. HOWEVER they are fairly sure the primary cancer was from a lung tumor she had removed 30 + years ago and had been slowly growing in her liver for that long. So, it's technically CUP it seems, but they know where the primary was, I think. 

My mother doesn't like to talk much about it because I think she's trying to protect me. She doesn't want me online Googling all her treatments and her symptoms, so she often wont tell me the names of the drugs she's on. She just finished 8 mos of chemo which apparently is very targeted bc she hasn't lost her hair and her immune system is hanging in there. 

HOWEVER when I called home last week my father and her told me there was good news! All of the tumors in her bones had gone away except for one, which she would have radiation for. Excellent news, except I was never told she had tumors in her bones. I had no idea. I didn't say anything and was happy for her and continued the phone call as if nothing was wrong, but I was completely blindsided. They made no mention of the fact they hadn't told me.

I'm so glad there was some good news regarding her cancer, but the fact that I'm not told everything makes me feel like there's something terrible they are not telling me. All I've been told is that her cancer is a pretty unique situation, that the tumors in her liver are very very slow growing, and that overall it seems like it's not in panic mode yet. 

I wish I was allowed to be in on all the information, so I knew what my mother is facing. I also know that things change and things get worse, and I don't trust that they would tell me that either. I don't know what to do. My mother is a headstrong woman who doesn't like to be out of control, or treated like as sick person, so I'm sure this is her way of dealing with that. I also know that this isn't my sickness, it's hers, and she's allowed to handle it as she likes. I just love her and want to support. Is there anything I can do? I'm feeling frustrated and scared. Ugh. Thank you if you've read this whole thing.

TL;DR: My mother won't tell me the whole picture when it comes to her cancer.",2020-06-12 10:45:48

The good: My dad successfully beat bladder cancer :D! Diagnosed in the fall, chemo in the winter, bladder removed in the spring, fully recovered from surgery and no signs of cancer anywhere else. 

The worrying: Talking to him, I worry that he has turned this victory into a defeat. There is a 50% chance of the cancer recurring somewhere else in the next five years, and with nothing else to do in the time of Covid it seems like he is in a period of deep rumination on his own mortality, talking about how he doesn't think he'd want to go through all that a second time. I'm totally accepting of people's right to things like a DNR and not to suffer unnecessarily, but I worry that there is nothing he seems to want to live for, nothing pulling him to life and not much to look forward to besides decades of slow, potentially painful aging. 

He was also on opiates recovering from the surgery, and has been cutting back (withdrawal irritation?). Now mostly tylenol at safe dosages and CBD for sleep.

My parents are retired in their 60s, don't have many friends, and the things that brought him joy (swimming, volunteering) are currently off-limits. Hopefully that changes sooner than later. My sister lives across the country, and I live across an ocean so it's not possible for us to see him more than a few times a year, but I have been stepping up with more phone calls, sharing photos, getting them little gifts etc.

I just wanted to share a wonderful experience I had while watching a TV show.

To preface. My mother was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer exactly a year ago.  We have for the most part been well and adapting to this new life.  But we have struggled with communicating with each other our deep feelings about the situation and what will come.  Mainly facing what life means without each other.  
I was watching a show on Netflix titled ""The Midnight Gospel."" and found an episode that I think really helped myself, my mother and anyone else currently struggling with this. For those who are unaware it is an adult animated series adapting real interviews from a podcast hosted by Duncan Trussell. 
Duncans mother passed away from cancer and before she passed he had a long in depth interview with her. And his interview with her was adapted into Episode 8 ""Mouse of Silver.""
It was really beautiful.  So I shared it with my mother.  And while it is not something my mother would normally watch, she did and since then we have had better communication and it has put in her a place of ease. 
I want to encourage others to watch this episode (or all the episodes!) and maybe share it with loved ones.  If the animated effects are too much, then just listening is enough. 

I'd also like to ask if there are any other forms of media people have found that have touched them and helped them through all this.  Books, movies, shows, articles. Please I'd love to hear.",2020-05-19 04:59:42

"Rant: F17. mom has terminal cancer, and i almost lost her the other day, I feel suicidal, guilty, and hopeless",3,g76sqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/g76sqs/rant_f17_mom_has_terminal_cancer_and_i_almost/,6,1587756755.0,"I turn 18 May 7th. my mom has been fighting stage 4 pancreatic cancer for nearly 8 months now. In the beginning I honestly never expected her to live this long, and I‚Äôm grateful. But ever since her diagnosis I began to shut down entirely, I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôve wasted the time left with her and haven‚Äôt done enough for her,It kills me.  

I want to do more for my mother, I want to give her everything. But everyday is a struggle. My dad is gone for 1 month at a time so every other month I‚Äôm her primary caretaker and its been so hard for me. I used to leave school way early so I could be home for her. Everyday is a constant internal battle with hating myself, feeling worthless, seeing no reason to keep living, feeling like a horrible daughter for not doing my part.  I just DONT KNOW why my dad would leave mom with me without another helping hand at home, especially when he knows I‚Äôm depressed to the point where i can‚Äôt move, I‚Äôve also recently become partially immobile because I broke my fuckinf tailbone, making me even more bedridden then I was before. 

 Ive tried to do as much as I can, but I feel like I‚Äôm glued to my bed. Ever since I was in 5th grade I‚Äôve dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts, so when she was diagnosed I slipped into the worst depression I‚Äôve ever felt. I‚Äôve tried to commit suicide several times within the past few months. and recently I watched  her nearly die in front of me because I accidentally napped too long and her blood sugar was so low (she‚Äôs type 2 diabetic). She said this was the worst her sugar has ever been. I can‚Äôt help but blame myself. She couldn‚Äôt hear me or speak to me, she was in a vegetable-like state, I fed her by hand and just kept holding her hand and rubbing it and saying I loved her, I thought it was my last time with her. and she started crying hard, and I asked why she was crying and she kept saying because my hand felt good in her hand. I stayed strong and didn‚Äôt cry, i haven‚Äôt shown any hurt in front of her over her poor health, I keep all my tears behind closed doors. she lived that night, but it still scares me to think about it, it scares me so much everytime her blood sugar gets low, everyday is scary for me

I want to learn more about her. I have a little bit, but not as much as I‚Äôd like to. I don‚Äôt even know her families names nor have I seen their faces in pictures. I haven‚Äôt met ANYONE from her family. Not her mother, father, brother, sister, niece, no one. Lately when I ask her more than 1 simple question like ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs your favorite food‚Äô she just says she doesn‚Äôt care to answer. It‚Äôs not like she has no energy and can‚Äôt talk, she talks a lot, she just doesn‚Äôt like questions lately. I‚Äôve at least recorded several conversations with her in the past several months, but I still feel like I know her only on the surface level. We have a communication barrier because she speaks broken English, and I never got to learn her native tongue. I just feel like I‚Äôm stuck and like I‚Äôll never move from here, I don‚Äôt treat every day like it‚Äôs her last day alive, I just feel horrible, so horrible that I‚Äôve just stopped living, I‚Äôm just existing now. 

I can‚Äôt take care of myself or my school work. I began to not do classwork when the school year started, I‚Äôve been a 4.0 GPA student all my HS career but now I‚Äôm at a 1.5. I‚Äôm failing 2 college courses and haven‚Äôt turned in a single thing for 2 other classes, meaning I have a total of 0% in them. I‚Äôve just given up on every aspect of my life. I‚Äôm turning down an $18k scholarship, i probably won‚Äôt go to college this year, maybe not ever. I just don‚Äôt care. I didn‚Äôt expect to be alive at this point so I have no future planned. 

I have coped by mainly by sleeping up to 17 hrs a day, becoming a recluse and laying in bed withdrawing from everyday life and socialization as much as I can, overeating all the time and gaining 20 pounds in 6 months (I hate my body now lol) and drowning my sorrows in drugs and trivial things like television. Call me lazy or a horrible person or whatever but if you‚Äôve had depression you‚Äôd know that it makes even brushing your hair or getting out of bed seem like running a marathon. I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say with this whole rant is that I‚Äôve given up on life",2020-04-24 19:32:35

Stage 4 Colon Cancer,3,fjtl57,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/fjtl57/stage_4_colon_cancer/,7,1584425742.0,"Hi. So my dad has stage 4 colon cancer and the course of treatment is just chemo. It‚Äôs basically to prolong life with a 2 year prognosis. I‚Äôm having a hard time with the idea of chemo because my dad said he feels no pain. I was wondering if anyone had any experience with not doing treatment? I‚Äôm very far from being a doctor, and I just got all this official news today, so I have no idea where to turn to or what to do. I‚Äôm about 19 hours away from my immediate family, so I‚Äôm not at the doctors appointments. Deep down, I feel that I know that this is it...and I don‚Äôt want his last moments on earth to be miserable! I‚Äôd rather him have a good 5 months, doing things he always wanted to do, instead of being sick all the time. Am I just being naive? I don‚Äôt know what to do. I told my mom to ask the doctor these questions, and eventually my dad when he is ready. Obviously, I‚Äôll support whatever he decides.

Struggling with emotions,3,fg0hru,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/fg0hru/struggling_with_emotions/,1,1583811817.0,"So to cut the longest part of the story short, I lost my aunt to pancreatic and liver cancer just before Christmas, and we had her cremation on Christmas Eve.  At her funeral my mum was in a significant amount of pain, but my mum being as stubborn as a mule, it took almost everyone in attendance to tell her to go to the doctor's.

Fast forward to new years eve and mum has been to the doctor's and he wanted her to be admitted to hospital immediately that day as he was concerned about her renal function.  So she goes to the hospital and they run all relevant tests and discover a mass on her ovaries, and she has started to get a large build up of fluid in her abdomen.  She remained in hospital for about 2 weeks so they could drain the fluids and keep an eye on her kidney function.

After her stay in hospital she returned home, but was very weak and remained in bed most of the time.  It's now 30th January and we go to an appointment with the oncologist to find out where we are with the discovery.
During the appointment mum was in extreme amounts of pain so the appointment had to be cut short because the oncologist wanted her back in the hospital, but before she went back he did disclose to me and my dad that it was aggressive but didn't say much more than that.

So we get her back the hospital (which for me was the most difficult ambulance journey of my life, not only did I fear for my mum's life but never did I think that I would have to use training in restraint on my own mum) and she is pretty whacked out from the oramorph, and after more tests we are told she would need to go to CDU to get an infection under control in her kidneys.  Before she went down a doctor there took me, my dad, my brother and my sister to a separate room and told us that the cancer is stage 4, and that the mass is obstructing her kidneys not allowing them to function properly (worst moment of my life)

So after a couple of days in CDU she is taken back to the ward so we can start preparing for any imminent treatment that she would need in the small hope that she can beat this.  But over the next 24 days I had to watch my mum slowly either away and die and she succumbed to her cancer on the 23rd February 2020, truly the most difficult day of my life and I just don't know how to process this.  My friends, family and even work have all been nothing but amazing during all of this, but even with that support I just don't know to process the fact that I'll never speak to her again, or hear her laugh again, or have my son grow up knowing just how awesome she was, I know I can tell him about her as he grows but it's just not the same is it?  That is the hardest thing for me, knowing he won't have her in his life as he grows up.

If you took the time to read this I really do thank you, I find it extremely difficult to express how I'm feeling to people who can't see how I'm feeling, so if any of this didn't make sense I apologise

We‚Äôve barely left her side for days since she deteriorated so fast. Stage 4 melanoma, lungs and brain. Brain is full of these aggressive, massive tumors. They found thirty of them just a couple months ago, and since our first immunotherapy some have doubled or tripled in size. There‚Äôs just no room for her brain up there. 

That‚Äôs the most frustrating part. She‚Äôs so healthy. She‚Äôs active, strong heart, muscles, etc. If I could just get those tumors out of her brain, she‚Äôd be fine...except that we haven‚Äôt been able to get any food and barely any water in her for three days. 

It‚Äôs been both touching and devastating having friends and family come by or call to say their last words and pay respects. Most share wonderful stories, but a few lecture me about what else we should try, and to not give up because she‚Äôs a fighter. 

Those sentiments tear me apart. But even without them, I can‚Äôt stop thinking that I should have done more, that I could have done more sooner to help her beat this. Because now it‚Äôs too late and we just have to sit by her, administering comfort care, while her otherwise healthy body eats itself to death. 

I‚Äôm the oldest child, I‚Äôm the one that‚Äôs been here since that first appointment.

I'm drinking terrified of what's going to happen and I'm just worried sick.

My sister is 27, got married 6 months ago to the love of her life, and was trying to have a baby. 

Early January she found out she had a 3 cm tumor on her frontal lobe. She got it removed about a week after that and from what the doctor said everything is visibly gone along with everything that they could see on a MRI. 


A few days ago she got the results on the tumor a few days ago and it turns out it was a stage three astrocytoma. She's doing 6 weeks of chemo and up to 6 months of radiation. 

In the matter of a month we've all been on an emotional rollercoaster and somehow she's being so strong through it all. She's even still going to the fertility clinic and is trying to freeze some embryos. 

I'm in school, a 5 hour drive away, trying to stay in touch while she's still processing all this and trying to figure it all out by herself. I'm just trying to find out how to cope and the internet is a scary place that isn't helping my concerns when I Google all this information. 

I shouldn't be falling apart. I can hardly find the motivation to go to class I'm worried so much. I'm just worried all the time and I can't get it all out of my head. I'm stuck in the cycle of worrying about my sister, feeling terrible because she's just getting her life started and this is just a huge middle finger in their lives, and then emerging how can my sister be this strong when her life is ripping at the seams.

His tumor is located on the right side of his neck on his carotid artery and is considered inoperable at the moment but is shrinking with treatment so hopefully that changes.

The swelling is so bad at the area of the tumor that it makes it very hard to open his mouth and due to radiation he has lost all his teeth except one. All the while he is suffering from Belles Palsy on one side of his face.

I digress, what I am looking for is recipes that he can easily eat, are nutritious, and aren't that spicy as he finds most things spicy even soy sauce!

I love my Father-in-Law dearly so any suggestions would help immensely!

Thanks everyone in advance!

So my brother(12)  has been talking about a weird bump in his armpit. At first my parents and I throughly that maybe it was an ingrown hair that he was talking about. He‚Äôs a young boy and he‚Äôs about to go through puberty so we thought it was normal at first. However, the next day or so he had mentioned that it was ‚Äúgrowing‚Äù so my dad checked it out and found out that it wasn‚Äôt an ingrown hair. It was much larger. 

The day after thanksgiving my parents took him to the hospital to get it checked out. The doctors looked at it and said that they were concerned. They found out that it was three swollen lymph nodes that were causing the bump. So they ran a few tests to see if maybe it was an infection that none of us had known about. The results came back and there was no sign of infection nor trauma. 

They said that they wanted to schedule an appointment with his doctor to run more tests. It‚Äôs currently Monday and in the two days since the hospital trip the bump has grown tremendously. It‚Äôs now reaching his back and we are very concerned. He said that it is beginning to hurt more. Each day it seems as if it‚Äôs been rapidly getting worse. 

My father and I don‚Äôt want to say anything because we do not want to scare my mother and little brothers. However, we are concerned about him having lymphoma. We have quite a bit of family history dealing with cancer so this doesn‚Äôt really paint a calming picture for us.

I‚Äôm 16 so to be honest I really have no idea what to do. It‚Äôs not certain that he has lymphoma but it‚Äôs a real possibility and don‚Äôt even know how to process that. I love that kid more than anything in this world and I‚Äôm scared for him. I‚Äôm scared of what he‚Äôs going through and the possibility of what he could possibly have to go though. I don‚Äôt know, I feel like I‚Äôm over reacting. I‚Äôm just scared and really upset about it. I truthfully want to cry because I don‚Äôt want anything to happen to the kid. I‚Äôve always been very protective of my little brother but this isn‚Äôt something I can protect him from. I can‚Äôt take the hit for him this time and I hate it. We have always been very close. My family and I are trying our very best to stay positive and hope for a good outcome right now. 

I have a lot going on as of now, especially with school. Exams are 16 days away and I have a lot of school work to stay on top of. I just feel very overwhelmed and all I can think about is if my little brother will be okay. How can I make his day better today and how can I try to make things better. I don‚Äôt really know, my heart just kinda feels heavy if that makes sense. I never thought that my family would every face something like this.

We are still waiting for his next appointment so they can tell us what‚Äôs next and what‚Äôs going on.

I am getting married soon and I‚Äôm not super sure if my dad will be able to come to my wedding due to when he finishes treatments. 

I have gone through so many different emotions. When we first found out I think I was in denial on how hard his treatments are going to be. I was naive to believe he was just going to be the same dad he‚Äôs always been after all this. I had this thought that when treatment is done then he‚Äôs better, and that‚Äôs just simply not the case. 

We went to one doctor who gave us doom and gloom about everything that dad will lose or go through. The first doc said that teeth would all be pulled, feeding tube, loss of voice, loss of all salivary glands, loss of hearing, hair loss, weigh loss. And just loss all over because dad just won‚Äôt ever be the same again. And he is a rockstar. 70-80% chance of beating this thing. This doctor said if I want my dad to be at my wedding to get married now. 

The doctor we just met with about proton radiation therapy gave us hope. He said it‚Äôs a 10% chance he‚Äôll need a feeding tube, 1% chance of needing to have teeth pulled, will lose just one salivary glands rather than all, 1% chance of losing hearing, no hair loss, no cognitive issues. This doctor worked at MDAnderson for 15 years. This doctor said dad will have hard treatments no doubt but will be able to make it to my wedding. Gave dad a 93-95% chance of beating this thing with less radiation and side effects than the first doctor. We are going to use this doctor for dad‚Äôs treatments.

My dad refuses to let us get married before our wedding date because he says he will make it no matter what. This whole thing just feels sucky. I feel jealous of my friend getting married this weekend who will have her dad walk her down the aisle. I feel jealous of my fianc√© who will have both his parents at our wedding. I feel mad that this is even happening to a man who has had perfect health and never smoked a day in his life. I don‚Äôt know how to watch my superhero be sick and in pain. My dad is the strongest man I know and I know he‚Äôs going to beat this and that‚Äôs all that matters. I just can‚Äôt help but grieve the moment we both have been waiting and praying for. I can‚Äôt help but feel sad that I may not have my dad walk me down the aisle and get to dance with at the wedding.

I‚Äôm his caregiver now and am struggling to do everything while also making ends meet. I don‚Äôt know if I should be feeling these things.. is it wrong that I expected my family members to help us? I know some of them really can‚Äôt afford it and that‚Äôs okay of course ..but I know some who are wealthy and know of our situation but have only sent cards and haven‚Äôt donated a penny to our go fund me. Am I wrong for feeling frustrated? We‚Äôve only been married a year and I would have thought family would help us especially considering what an aggressive cancer he as. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Supporting my S/O,3,cjfy0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/cjfy0p/supporting_my_so/,6,1564456694.0,"Hopefully this is the right place to ask. Also posted in /r/CancerCaregivers. 

My partner's mom is what we believe to be in the end of life stages (ovarian cancer). 

Today, she signed DNR papers and she has been scheded to move to hospice care asap. I know what this means. 

He lost his dad 10 years ago to a heart attack, and now will be losing his mom. 

Aside from constant communication, and of course, asking what he needs from me... is there anything I should anticipate? What is something I should be mindful of in a situation where he shuts down / doesn't communicate with me? We are both young (23) and I've never lost a parent. I want to do my best to make sure he is okay through this process. 

Thanks in advance to anyone who is able to offer their advice and feedback.",2019-07-30 03:18:14
My mother has stage three ovarian cancer and is getting a port for chemo in two days.,3,c411w6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/c411w6/my_mother_has_stage_three_ovarian_cancer_and_is/,9,1561307274.0,"Brand new here. My mother went in for surgery three weeks ago to have a mass roughly the size of a football removed from her abdomen.

I know how it sounds, but she's actually a very petite woman and her 'beer belly' was quite noticable. She and everyone around her including me just chalked it up to weight gain later in life. I guess, hindsight being what it is, we didn't want to think something could be wrong.

Turns out it was in fact ovarian cancer. She healed well from surgery with just the complication of a stomach bug they said was common with this type of surgery. In two days she's going in to have a port installed in her chest for chemo. There are three spots of this cancer left in her that couldn't be removed for some reason.

Just throwing this out there but I am probably the least informed person in this situation. I'm getting all this knowledge second-hand from either my mother or my father. And things keep on changing about what I'm told. At first it was just one spot they couldn't get out, so it may be much worse than they're letting me know.

This kills me on so many levels. I am an adult. When things go south for the both of them I am the adult that will be caring for them. Still I'm being treated like a child. I feel like things are being kept from me to shield me from it for some reason I can't comprehend.

I also feel restricted in how much I can badger either of them about it. They are deniers. If you don't talk about it, it goes away types. Also they are going through this too, I don't want to be an ass.

Thanks for this sub partly to let me vent and help me process this tragedy, also I'd like to ask some questions.

If anyone has knowledge on this type of cancer, is it very treatable? My parents boom with a resounding yes but I find them not the best sources. Also how will this chemo effect her? What can I do to help, if anything?

I would Google these things but, being weak as I am, I can't see through the tears and it makes it so final in a cold detached way. Not like communication with actual human.

I'm sorry, I've rambled. I've never been through this before and I don't know what I'm doing basically.

Thank you for being here, and for this sub existing.",2019-06-23 16:27:54
Advice on staying positive?,3,c2rcun,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/c2rcun/advice_on_staying_positive/,7,1561032912.0,"I never thought I would post something like this but... here I am. My mom recently was diagnosed with ovarian cancer (while we‚Äôre waiting on the stage diagnosis at the moment) and this was when we went to see if her symptoms were due to menopause but after medication nothing was helping. She had an ultrasound and they found a mass in her ovary. It‚Äôs been a couple of days and I‚Äôve still been going to work and trying to study for my LSATs (hoping to go next fall to law school) but I‚Äôve been struggling with staying positive and strong for my family. I‚Äôm an only child and I had always been a source of positivity for my family but this hit me hard and I‚Äôve been crying nonstop. My mom wanted me to promise her that I wouldn‚Äôt cry again but whenever I see her in pain and throwing up nonstop it‚Äôs incredibly hard to stay positive. 

I was wondering if there are any tips on at least trying to stay strong without thinking of the worst case scenario? This all happened so fast and I don‚Äôt know how to cope with it at the moment. Thank you.

Edit/ also, I was wondering how to keep going on with your life? As in, I feel like I should drop everything to be by her side but she told me to keep doing what I‚Äôve been doing. But I feel like that‚Äôs selfish? Or is she right?",2019-06-20 12:15:12
I hate cancer.,3,c0okme,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/c0okme/i_hate_cancer/,1,1560571220.0,"Last year my bf‚Äôs grandmother got breast cancer for the third time, after the first chemo treatment she was in and out of hospitals with all sorts of problems, one of them she picked up while at the hospital, C-DIF. She lost a lot of weight due to not being able to eat anything and we thought we were going to lose her this time around. I was basically the only one who could and was willing to take care of her throughout everything so that my bf and his mother could work, I took her to treatment, doctor appointments, hospitals, and ERs where we would wait all day for them to get a room for her so they could monitor her, plus taking care of her at home. It got really stressful being the only one doing it all, but I wouldn‚Äôt go back to change anything. The cancer is gone along with the breast, they said they won‚Äôt take the other one unless there is cancer. They started her on after chemo treatment that she‚Äôs been doing since November or December, recently she went in for a echo on her heart and they discovered that the after chemo treatment is messing with her heart, it‚Äôs beating faster than normal, and that she needs to stop treatment. She fought so hard to beat cancer, she was doing great, and now she can‚Äôt do much of anything because of her heart.

Today I got a message from my uncle, they found two large cancer spots on his lungs, with his COPD and bronchitis he has to stay on oxygen 24 hours a day, chemo is not an option as it‚Äôs too harsh and would most likely kill him. They‚Äôre trying to find an alternative way to treat him, since he lives in Texas medical marijuana is not an option at the moment, though they are trying to get the bill passed but it‚Äôs not looking good for those that need it. I agree with my uncle when he says that he should have stayed in California, right now with everything he would able to get alternative treatment and have a roof over his head, plus he would be only 5 hours from me in case anything happens. He moved to Texas to be closer to a good friend‚Äôs family, I thought he was going to live with them, instead he‚Äôs living out of his car. We also have family close to him at the moment in Texas and I don‚Äôt know why they won‚Äôt open their homes to him, one being one of his sisters, one of my aunts. If I had the room to spare and the money to do it I would bring him here. 

I feel helpless, I wish I could do more, I don‚Äôt want to lose either of them.",2019-06-15 04:00:20
My dad has stage 3 lung cancer,3,c00n86,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/c00n86/my_dad_has_stage_3_lung_cancer/,2,1560424496.0,"So my dad went to urgent care for a cough that wouldn‚Äôt go away and after a few scans later he was diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer. It‚Äôs in his left lung and lymph nodes in his chest near his heart. 

My dad is 72 and I think he‚Äôs been struggling with depression for a few years. He has never seen anyone for it or been treated for it. My sister brought up his mental state to his primary physician recently before his diagnosis and he was prescribed anti depressants. 

We‚Äôre scheduled to see the oncologist on Friday but just today he said he is done and just wished to die. He doesn‚Äôt want to see the doctors. This upset me on so many levels. Is it wrong of me to try to convince him? How can he decide to quit when the fight hasn‚Äôt even started? I know he‚Äôs scared and anxious, but what can I say to convince him to already hear the doctors out about what can be done? 

It‚Äôs such bad timing with his state of mind to try and fight cancer. He hasn‚Äôt been exercising for quite sometime and his muscles have slowly atrophied. He struggles to walk. 

I‚Äôm not sure his body or mind will let him do chemo. Is radiation just as tough? Targeted therapy? Immunotherapy?

I‚Äôm all over the place. I‚Äôm venting but also asking for suggestions. Please help. Thanks.",2019-06-13 11:14:56

I feel really depressed. 

I family friend way very close and I just want to vent out my frustrations and disbelief of the reality. The friend was a grown lady with a husband and now adult teen. She helped me when I had trouble with elementary. 

She was a wonderful person to help me study and get great grades and I thank her to this day. In Middle school I grew distant, but my sibling would replace me for study practice. 

Over the years she grew more weary and less frequent until I heard that she had cancer. I don‚Äôt remember which type or where it is, but I was sad that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to talk to her anymore. 

I decided that I would grow out my hair and cut it for her. She had always complemented my hair and said that she would love to have hair like that. 

That was about 2-3 Years ago that I was told she had cancer. She responded to our text, but few days ago when we texted her. She was gone. I miss her so much. I‚Äôll still treasure her and the things she gifted me and my family. 

I need to tell how I‚Äôm feeling. I will continue to grow my hair until I‚Äôm a senior and donating all of it to a cancer foundation. I have about 2-3 feet of hair but I want this to be the best perfect hair to my dearest teacher and tutor. I love you Ms.Ruthy please I hope you reached peace after all the stress of cancer. 

Please I just need some kind words. I just have to do so much right now. And thank you for investing time to read this. This is my first post.",2019-05-07 11:39:35

My dad,3,bkoaw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/bkoaw1/my_dad/,13,1557024159.0,"My dad has been ill for the past 6 months. After many tests, different diagnoses, prescriptions,  he was not getting better.  Recently a ct scan has revealed tumors in his brain, throat, lungs, liver, and intestines. We knew he was pretty ill but did not realize how bad it actually was, and now within the past few days we went from thinking he would get better eventually, to having no hope. Doctors are saying that treatment will only be to make him comfortable. He may not even have a MONTH left. I don't know what to do. My family is a mess. My dad is a mess. It feels unreal.

My dad is not even 60 yet and he has never smoked, doesn't really drink, never touched drugs.  We have so many questions still , and doctors are still doing tests to figure out the source of it. I'm so mad that his cancer was discovered so late and that there's nothing left to do. It feels so unfair.

 Right now he's trying to sort out all his finances and will etc. I cant imagine how that must feel for him. My mom is doing an amazing job keeping it together for everyone but I can see how hard it is for her. She is losing her husband. And it's killing her to see us kids hurting so badly.

I feel extremely useless right now, can't find the words to say to anyone, have no idea how to help my mom. My dad and I are the type of people that find it hard to talk about feelings. It's incredibly difficult seeing him and talking about it.  

 Ive never lost someone close to me. This is the worst feeling I've ever felt.",2019-05-05 02:42:39
