0,Fuck that Bell!,"Sorry for the title, but I wish the bell ringing and party music and celebration of the last round of chemo will stop.

I have a friend that is fighting for his life. 3 weeks after getting a certificate  for completing 12 rounds of chemo. He made it less than two weeks because he has been in The ICU since last week Saturday.

The cancer did not go into remission, he was not NED at all, but they made a huge thing about his last round. 

He had to go for an emergency operation as his tumor grew and blocked his colon. He could not pass anything, not gas not solids, nothing.
Now he is on a machine that keeps him breathing as his lungs are shot. The oncologist told him not to stop smoking as his body won’t be able to take the stress.

Last night was the first time he woke up as he was in a coma. His daughter said that he can’t understand what is going on. Why he has tubes in every hole in his body. AFAIK the doctor did a colostomy for him.

But still, after ringing the bell and making a huge fuss. The false hope it gave him that he was done with cancer and then few days later cancer almost took him out?

I will kindly refuse to ring the bell and will refuse the loud celebration! 

The day they find a cure for cancer will be the day that I will celebrate.",6.0,"['fuck', 'bell', 'sorry', 'title', 'wish', 'bell', 'ringing', 'party', 'music', 'celebration', 'last', 'round', 'chemo', 'will', 'stop', 'friend', 'fighting', 'life', 'digit', 'weeks', 'after', 'getting', 'certificate', 'completing', 'digit', 'rounds', 'chemo', 'made', 'less', 'than', 'number', 'weeks', 'because', 'has', 'been', 'icu', 'since', 'last', 'week', 'dayofweek', 'cancer', 'did', 'not', 'remission', 'not', 'ned', 'all', 'made', 'huge', 'thing', 'about', 'last', 'round', 'had', 'emergency', 'operation', 'tumor', 'grew', 'blocked', 'colon', 'could', 'not', 'pass', 'anything', 'not', 'gas', 'not', 'solids', 'nothing', 'now', 'on', 'machine', 'keeps', 'breathing', 'lungs', 'shot', 'oncologist', 'not', 'stop', 'smoking', 'body', 'will not', 'able', 'take', 'stress', 'last', 'night', 'first', 'time', 'woke', 'up', 'coma', 'famrel', 'said', 'can not', 'understand', 'going', 'on', 'why', 'has', 'tubes', 'every', 'hole', 'body', 'afaik', 'doctor', 'did', 'colostomy', 'after', 'ringing', 'bell', 'making', 'huge', 'fuss', 'false', 'hope', 'gave', 'dnumber', 'cancer', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'cancer', 'took', 'out', 'will', 'kindly', 'refuse', 'ring', 'bell', 'will', 'refuse', 'loud', 'celebration', 'day', 'find', 'cure', 'cancer', 'will', 'day', 'will', 'celebrate']",fuck bell sorry title wish bell ringing party music celebration last round chemo will stop friend fighting life digit weeks after getting certificate completing digit rounds chemo made less than number weeks because has been icu since last week dayofweek cancer did not remission not ned all made huge thing about last round had emergency operation tumor grew blocked colon could not pass anything not gas not solids nothing now on machine keeps breathing lungs shot oncologist not stop smoking body will not able take stress last night first time woke up coma famrel said can not understand going on why has tubes every hole body afaik doctor did colostomy after ringing bell making huge fuss false hope gave dnumber cancer few days later cancer took out will kindly refuse ring bell will refuse loud celebration day find cure cancer will day will celebrate
1,Father suffering from end stage aggression. Won’t take pain meds on time and thinks my sister and I are conning him somehow. This happened suddenly. Advice please,"My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 bone cancer in January. 

We made the decision to put him on hospice on Thursday (5 days ago) and he was finally given the pain meds he’s been waiting for. He slept almost all day Friday and Saturday. Sunday was Father’s Day and he ate bbq with my aunt and grandma and was still his happy and normal self. That evening we moved him into his hospital bed that was set up in the living room, about 20 steps from the bed he was in. He could not stand up on his own or lift his foot up to take a step. It took a lot of work but we got him into the new bed Sunday. 

Since then he has become completely different. He is not allowing my sister and I to help him or clean him the way we have been for months. And since he’s been so out of it he’s starting to refuse his meds in an attempt to be more lucid and less confused. He is not accepting what’s happening and he’s fighting death. 

The last 3 days have been very hard. He will not allow us to change his bed linens, can’t remember where his table or urinal is, and is saying random things that make absolutely no sense. The worst part is he no longer trusts my sister and I. He is being mean and insulting. He thinks we are conning him or trying to intentionally OD him. I know it’s the meds and it’s not him and I am not taking it personally but I do not know what to do to calm him down. 

He is refusing his anxiety meds and when I talk to him in a calm quiet voice he says it doesn’t sound like me and he is embarrassed. When I talk confidently he thinks I am bossing him around. I’m just taking a step back right now and helping when he asks me to but I know his pain is not getting any better. Any advice from someone who has been through this will be a tremendous help.

3,ER phobia?,"Have any of your loved ones checked out of the hospital AMA? (Against Medical Advice). Why did they do that?  Do they refuse to go to the ER? If they want to live what are some of the reasons for these things?

My brother (Sarcoma METS to lungs-""stable/functioning very normaily"" before clot) checked himself out the day after being admitted to the ICU AMA for a blood clot that went to his chest. He is still alive. Still swears he wants to live. (Well as of today he isn't very verbal anymore) Signed hospice papers saying do everything possible to keep him alive. However, he refuses to go to the ER when we think he should. He made his girlfriend promise not to put him in the ER. And he promised me he would call an ambulance if it was needed. I'm trying to advocate for him but stuck on what the right thing to do is.

Just trying to get some help understanding him and what he might actually be thinking.

Any advice or similar situations would be appreciated regarding the ER stuff or blood clots/ PE's.

We are here getting a CT scan and the nurse wanted to go check with the tech to make sure they could use his PICC line for the dye. Since she showed uncertainty, he panicked and demanded we get the department we have regularly been dealing with on the phone to get approval. He got heated with the nurse and made us call a few places to get answers, then got heated with the tech when he came in to tell him it’s ok. 

Now all the departments are making us verify all his info just to answer this simple question which is pissing him off even further. They make us give name, birthday, address, member number, and then we ask and they said oh we don’t know let’s transfer you some where else. We have done this 3 times already.

7,Not all stories have a sad ending.,"I just wanted to post here to say this as I'm actually quite happy for once. I also want to say that while this sub can be full of heartbreaking stories, not every cancer story ends badly.

194 days ago my son who is 5 (4 at diagnosis) was diagnosed with Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma. This was after we saw a lump that swelled his right eye. We were supposed to have Christmas on that day (26th/Boxing Day in the UK) as my wife had spent most of Christmas Day in hospital herself (Braxton Hicks pains with her pregnancy).

The diagnosis first came in as a brain tumor, likely neuroblastoma which thankfully wasn't the case. Further tests showed it was NHL and was 'brain adjacent', inside the skull and against the brain but not in the brain. This was good news, which led to the bizarre conversation about ""if you had to have a cancer, NHL is the cancer to have"". That is still a strange sentence to say but it's quite true, apparently it's a low comeback rate and a high cure rate, the two things you want the most.

We are now about 6 months or so after that conversation, we have had back to back hard going chemo that caused some horrible side effects and we have been around people whose journeys didn't end as we would have hoped, but we are here now. Today was the end of treatment meeting with the oncologists. We are now officially no longer under treatment and are showing no evidence of disease. The doc didn't really like the words 'in remission' (to him it's just the same as NED) but they fit well here.

We have a lovely 5 year old who is ready to take on the world again. His strength and mobility returns day after day and soon the only reminders of this episode will be a few small scars on his chest from the now removed portcath.

We realise that the paranoia will be there and understand that there is still a journey ahead of us, but to be told we are no longer under treatment was the best delayed Christmas present a dad could ask for.

Now we can look to the future for the first time in ages and I can't wait to see where we go from here.

To those reading this who are not yet at the end of their journey, or who have had this come back, I hope this doesn't discourage or upset you. I hope that the people reading this take happiness in the fact that this can be beaten, that somewhere out there in the real world a little 5 year old can be at home with mum, dad and his two little sisters (the youngest of which was born 1 week after diagnosis - mums water broke while on the ward!).

8,Mom passed away,"My mom has been fighting multiple myeloma for a year now.
She already had a stem cell transplant in January but results said that she wasn't in full remission, so she had a second one a week ago.
But due to a weak immune system she went into septic choc. 
It was so quick.
She passed away this Sunday at 9 am after less then 24 hours in intensive care. 
I love you mom, I'm gonna miss your smile, talking to you, holding you and every little thing about you even hearing you snoring at night. 
It has been tough. 
I love you.
I didn't want to put this in the MM subreddit, didn't want to scare anyone , I just wanted to vent and to let everyone know how much I love you. 
I also wanted that anyone that will read this to think about you and say may she rest in piece. 
It's kind of a sacred thing in our culture when you wish for a deceased person to be in heaven and that God will protect her, maybe it's similar to everyone.
I love you mom, you're beauty you're kindness you're love you're courage you're hope.

9,"22,Last year was the best in my life, and was on my way to realising my dreams, yesterday I found out I had Ewing's sarcoma","I'm a 22 year old male who's soon to be 23 this Tuesday and here's my story: 

I grew up in a good loving family, which I'm thankful for, but  growing up my life outside the house wasn't something I'd look forward to. I was the skinny kid in school, so I got bullied pretty much every year in school until I changed highschools. It once got so bad I stopped going out altogether for a good 3 years, my eyes would burn if I saw the sun, my peers were socialising and building their personalities, while I was becoming lonely, awkward, anorexic - but thanks to my family  never depressed - , everyday I go to sleep I'd dream of being fit, funny and talkative like when I was a kid, maybe even fall in love!

At 17, I had to change highschools due to course availablity, I met some of my primary school friends, who are really good people, and helped me build myself back up. Over the next few years started taking care of myself, trying to become socially adept, athletic, and all around a great person. There were some hard times in that journey, mainly at 20yo I lost almost all my college friends because of my scoial skills ( I had a feud with a girl in our group, and I handled the situation badly ). But hey, I stood up again , and this time I was actually becoming a functional person and a friend, last couple of years i made a best friend, few more good friends and socially things were perfect.

Meanwhile, I also was working towards my fitness, took a good 4 years to stop getting injured and get the diet right, but I finally did it, last year I was swimming 2 miles twice a week easily, was running track and my cardio was phenomenal, in the gym I increased my bench from 40kg to 90kg for reps. I even started getting some looks for the girls in college! I asked someone out, but as it was my first time I fucked it up.

So about February 2019, I start getting this pain in iliac crest, but only when contracting my abs/hip flexors, but since I was working out so much, I figured it was tendonitis ( I mean I'm a medical student, I can't be possibly wrong right?). The pain kept coming and going but every time it stayed a day longer, and my hip muscles started getting stiff and my butt muscles aching a bit, i started to think it was a bone related issue, but I'm a healthy 22 year old, with no history of cancer in the family.

4th of August 2019, I wake up with some mild butt pain ( back pain I thought, for sure ), that evening I go for a run despite  the pain, and as soon as I go back home, the pain goes from a 1/10 to 5/10, so I took antiinflammatory drugs and went to bed. Next morning I wake up with excruciating pain in my hip. I decide to take a radiography of my pelvis, just to check if anything is wrong with my hip bone, I do that and go check with a orthopaedic surgeon, he doubtly says it's more likely tendonitis.

Over the next 5 weeks, I sit on the pain, my front hip is becoming better and painless, while my right butt is alternating between pain, and cramp like feeling, it starts to mess up with my daily life. My doctor mom finally convince me to go take an MRI this Thursday.

I go into the MRI laying down - the most painful position for me -, I tough it out, the technician enters the room, tells we're doing another round, and gives me support for my legs fo the pain , now I'm thinking I probably just moved a lot and they're redoing it. Another 20m goes by, he comes back, but now with a contrast chemical, a nurse comes in and starts asking about my hip history,
""fuck this is bad"" I thought. I go out of the MRI, just to be told I need to do a CT scan.

Saturday, I go with my family to the clinic to get my results, I let my doctor parents take them while I watch formula 1 qualifying, I hear the nurse call my name, I  stand up and look for parents, my dad os holding the paper, shows it to my mom who turns her head in that "" this is the worst thing that could've happened "" manner"". That moment I knew. 

I'd like to finish by saying, I knew I was special, but not special enough to get a 3 per million bone cancer.",6.0,"['digitlast', 'year', 'best', 'life', 'on', 'way', 'realising', 'dreams',

11,Trying to act normal,"Well, we have hit the fast end of the spiral. My dads thread is short. After the seizure on the fourth we were told we  essentially were living on borrowed time. I am devastated. No matter how much you know its coming, hearing it just rips your heart out. Now he is on hospice care and i am learning to get through my day acting normal. Not to make this about me but i am trying to have some tact so dad can enjoy his last days with us. Planning a day to the shore because he loves the ocean. But my mind cannot get the image of the seizure from my mind. There were no convulsions. I thought it was a heart attack thats how it looked. I did chest conpressions because i couldnt detect any breathing. Each moment burns knowing the last words passed my lips could be my last to him. Its getting harder to pretend i am ok when all i want to do is cry. I know i am not alone, so many before me have been in my shoes, but it still feels like i am stranded. Then i have horrible thoughts like it would have been so much easier if it had been a heart attack. He would have died believing there was hope instead of living in dispare with an ever growing depression. He would have died clear headed instead of an expanded confusion. He would have died with strong legs instead of wobbling to just stand. I hate myself for this thought and yet as he asks me the same question for the fourth time i revisit it. I feel so selfish. I feel so heartless. But im not heartless just broken hearted. I fight to he strong for everyone around me, to be that rational voice. To be that helping hand. Yes i could see a profession, but i truely believe i know most of what they will say. I just need to deal with my emotions. And i cannot deal with them as long as my mom and dad are in my house, and yet i dred when they will go back to their house because it means the moment may come and i would have unknowingly lived that last moment. I know it will eventually be ok...but for now...for now its not.

14,Throwaway: Mother Cannot Cope with Cancer Treatment,"Throwaway. I'm starting therapy soon, and I'll bring it up there, as well. Just some words to get off my shoulders today.

My mother (68) has metastatic breast cancer that has spread to her stomach, liver, and bones. For over two years, she has been kept progression-free and side-effect-free by some amazing at-home chemo pills.

Recently, her pills have failed, and the doctors have put her back on IV chemo at a hospital. She goes 3 times a month, and the oncology team's hope is to keep her progression-free for 6-9 months. After 5 treatments, her cancer markers are dropping, so preliminary results are good.

Emotionally, however, she has take a turn where does not want to be alive anymore and the \*key\* reason for this that she states all the time is that her hair has fallen out from chemo.

She'll say things like, ""I don't care about the stomach problems, all I can think about is how I don't have hair."" Or, ""I've lost my hair and I don't deserve to be alive anymore."" Or, ""I don't want to live if I have to wear a wig."" Or, ""Losing my hair means I'm a failure.""

For the past 2 years, she's been with a therapist who only works with cancer patients, so I'm sure they discuss it during her sessions.

I'm not looking to find a way to change her mind. I'm just dealing with the part where my mother has been given more time on Earth and she very clearly doesn't want to be here anymore and we don't have ""death with dignity"" procedures in our state and I feel like there's nothing we can do to help her enjoy the time she has left before the cancer really starts to kill her.",3.0,"['throwaway', 'famrel', 'cannot', 'cope', 'cancer', 'treatment', 'throwaway', 'I am', 'starting', 'therapy', 'soon', 'ill', 'bring', 'up', 'there', 'well', 'just', 'some', 'words', 'get', 'off', 'shoulders', 'today', 'famrel', 'digit', 'has', 'metastatic', 'breast', 'cancer', 'has', 'spread', 'stomach', 'liver', 'bnumbers', 'over', 'number', 'years', 'has', 'been', 'kept', 'progressionfree', 'sideeffectfree', 'some', 'amazing', 'athome', 'chemo', 'pills', 'recently', 'pills', 'failed', 'doctors', 'put', 'back', 'on', 'iv', 'chemo', 'hospital', 'goes', 'digit', 'times', 'month', 'oncology', 'teams', 'hope', 'keep', 'progressionfree', 'digit', 'months', 'after', 'digit', 'treatments', 'cancer', 'markers', 'dropping', 'so', 'preliminary', 'results', 'good', 'emotionally', 'however', 'has', 'take', 'turn', 'where', 'does', 'not', 'want', 'alive', 'anymore', 'key', 'reafamrel', 'states', 'all', 'time', 'hair', 'has', 'fallen', 'out', 'chemo', 'she will', 'say', 'things', 'like', 'do not', 'care', 'about', 'stomach', 'problems', 'all', 'think', 'about', 'how', 'do not', 'hair', 'I have', 'lost', 'hair', 'do not', 'deserve', 'alive', 'anymore', 'do not', 'want', 'live', 'wear', 'wig', 'losing', 'hair', 'means', 'I am', 'failure', 'past', 'digit', 'years', 'she is', 'been', 'therapist', 'only', 'works', 'cancer', 'patients', 'so', 'I am', 'sure', 'discuss', 'during', 'sessions', 'I am', 'not', 'looking', 'find', 'way', 'change', 'mind', 'I am', 'just', 'dealing', 'part', 'where', 'famrel', 'has', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'time', 'on', 'earth', 'clearly', 'does not', 'want', 'here', 'anymore', 'do not', 'death', 'dignity', 'procedures', 'state', 'feel', 'like', 'there is', 'nothing', 'do', 'help', 'enjoy', 'time', 'has', 'left', 'before', 'cancer', 'starts', 'kill']",throwaway famrel cannot cope cancer treatment throwaway I am starting therapy soon ill bring up there well just some words get off shoulders today famrel digit has metastatic breast cancer has spread stomach liver bnumbers over number years has been kept progressionfree sideeffectfree some amazing athome chemo pills recently pills failed doctors put back on iv chemo hospital goes digit times month oncology teams hope keep progressionfree digit months after digit treatments cancer markers dropping so preliminary results good emotionally however has take turn where does not want alive anymore key reafamrel states all time hair has fallen out chemo she will say things like do not care about stomach problems all think about how do not hair I have lost hair do not deserve alive anymore do not want live wear wig losing hair means I am failure past digit years she is been therapist only works cancer patients so I am sure discuss during sessions I am not looking find way change mind I am just dealing part where famrel has been given more time on earth clearly does not want here anymore do not death dignity procedures state feel like there is nothing do help enjoy time has left before cancer starts kill
15,Still sick after 3 weeks chemo,"Hi everyone,

My father in law finished up his chemo and radiation treatment three weeks ago but he’s still complaining of intense pain and having a really difficult time. He can’t eat much and is throwing up every day. He’s extremely weak and seems to be losing more weight. My question is, he stopped his treatment three weeks ago, shouldn’t he be feeling better by now?

Six months ago my ankle was hurting and i noticed a soft bump so i went to my doctor and she told me that i might have soft tissue damage and just to elevate and use heat come back in if it hurts. I had off and on pain but nothing really painful. On my birthday on the 7th my ankle really hurt and i noticed a lot of swelling. I also noticed my lymph nodes in my groin swelled which alarmed me so i made a appointment with my doctor. She was concerned about my lymph nodes so made a referral to a hematologist. The hematilogist thought there was a connection between my ankle and lymph nodes. Last Tuesday I got a ultrasound my hematologist was concerned about a sarcoma in my ankle so last thursday i got a biopsy. They took two samples of my ankle and a needle biopsy in my lymph node. Since last Thursday ive been on edge and had every emotion possible still trying to be optimistic. Today i found out the results that from my lymph nodes there is metastatic cancer but they dont know what kind of cancer I have in my ankle. They have to send the biopsy to another clinic for further analysis. Monday I have a appointment to figure out a plan.

21,"My wife's story, Long.","This is long, I hope that is ok. It helped me to write it and maybe it will help someone reading it.

&#x200B;

So, a few weeks ago my now 36 year old wife was diagnosed with stage 4 uterine cancer. It’s been a hard fight. We were already in the hospital when the diagnosed finally came through. We started off in a losing position and just didn’t know it yet. I am still her by her side, but we can’t even talk anymore other than a groggy eye blink here and there.

Our story starts long before this though. We’ve come to this realization during the long thoughts of why. April of last year she was hospitalized for anemia. She experienced heavy bleeding for a month, maybe more. She was given two units of blood as they thought that would stop the bleeding. And it did. She liked the doctor so much she continued to see her as her OYBG after the hospital stay. My wife ended up on birth control to control her hormones. And that was it.

And that was it. After talking about it over and over with friends, family, and friends of family, the best I’ve heard was that was a missed opportunity. She was very young, only 33 at the time, but had a couple of risk factors. Other than the heavy bleeding, though that alone maybe should have prompted a cancer screening. But it didn’t. It wasn’t even in our heads to force this issue or even bring it up.

Earlier this year she began complaining about back pain. Nothing too major. Around of April it began to hurt so much it was debilitating and she had pain in her front as well. It seemed like a UTI to her, she tried to self-treat a few days, but was quickly at her doctor’s office. They listed to her UTI concerns and gave her meds and sent her way. We ended up in the ER that weekend. Saw a nurse practitioner and tried to explain the past month of pain. My wife mentioned out the UTI symptoms seemed to be better maybe but her pain was getting worse. The NP focused on that asked her why was she in the ER if she was feeling better. Her conclusion was my wife fell or hurt herself without knowing. Even after she insisted that something felt wrong and was wondering if they could just scan something. They sent her home with muscle relaxers and ordered physical therapy. They did a culture for the UTI though, came back negative because there wasn’t one. I like to think of this as another missed opportunity.

She followed up the ER visit with her regular doctor, still seeking a scan or something, because this was wrong. He had no problem sending her to get one. Week later we were going over the results and she had an enlarged uterus. A follow up appointment was made with her OYBG. She was also sent for a CT scan, which at first she skipped because she at this time felt too weak. The pain was hard for her to deal with; everything they gave her did nothing. She also began experiencing extreme nausea and no longer had any appetite. She couldn’t get comfortable enough to sleep either and spent the nights pacing hoping the paid would subside enough so she could sit back down. Her OYBG took a biopsy and told her to go ahead and do the CT scan just in case. The follow up, no results. The biopsy had to be sent to another clinic for further testing. She had done the CT scan though and compared to the one they did when she was hospitalized in April. It looked bad. Her uterus was 10cm last year, now sitting at 24cm. She was referred to an Oncologist. April 24th was the first time Caner was said. She wasn’t diagnosed with it, but was seeing an Oncologist next.

We never made it to the Oncologist appointment. April 28th, just before midnight we went to the ER again. Pain, nausea, sleeplessness always getting worse. She was quickly admitted with acute kidney failure. They were barely working at all. It is possible the contrast they used for the CT scan compromised already struggling kidneys. Not great, but we were in the hospital now and dialysis was going to help.

The hospital was aware of all the other issues going on and added all the doctors who were already working on her case, including the Oncologist who stopped by the next day. He went over everything and referred to the growth or the mass frequently. In the end he said it had spread a little bit and the outcome did not look very good. We were still not full grasping what these words meant. This could have been the first time they could for given the heads up for stage 4 cancer. No he wanted to do a lymph node biopsy first. The first biopsy results still haven’t come back, I’m not sure it ever did. After three days they said the new biopsy was hard to diagnose. They said this could indicate it was rare. It? You could tell they wanted the results before the called it Cancer. They brought on another Oncologist who really wanted to start Chemo. The tumor was too large to operate and would put all of the surrounding organs at risk. But they need to know what to treat.

May 3rd, still awaiting results, she was having trouble breathing her blood pressure was getting low. They were adjusted medications trying to get a handle on it. Nothing worked awhile her blood pressure kept dropping. In the afternoon it got so bad she got moved to intensive care. Her breathing was very labored by now. They found a large blood clot in her lungs. The clot was pressing on her heart. They had found some in her legs earlier so she was already on blood thinners. She needed aggressive treatment now. They wanted to give her TPA. They problem was of course if her tumors were bleeding the treatment could cause her to bleed out. The doctor suggested a half dose and cross our figures. Bleeding risk was still there but also it might not work well enough. We gave her the medicine and crossed our figures. Doctor said it would be quick, and in 15 minutes my wife was able to breathe again and heart rate came down.  A day later she was out of the danger zone of bleeding out. Clots just don’t go away. Thank take time.

She was weak after that day. We were focused on getting her to eat, exercises to get her out of bed, and working her lungs so they don’t fail. We got our diagnosis. Endometrial adenocarcinoma. It wasn’t rare at all. It was hard to diagnose because it was aggressive and non-differentiating. So good news, we know what it was. Couldn’t start chemo with the way her vitals were. They wanted her out of the ICU. It took a week, but we were finally out May 10th. They still wanted to wait on Chemo; her hemoglobin levels were too low. Good news was they were going up every day. We had a goal and knew what was next. May 14th the day before her birthday she was told we could start Chemotherapy the next day. It had its risks and side effects. Did not help her kidneys still have not made a comeback. But the doctors could work around that. We were ready.

May 15th 4am she becomes non responsive. Over the next hour her heart stops five times. They have to put her on a respirator. Her mom got there quick. During the 5th cardiac arrest the doctor was telling this this was really bad and she was going to come back. We agreed that if she had another we would let her go. And like that she stabilized. The CPR team did great work they got the medicine in her that she needed. And she was stable, sedated with a breathing tube. They had her rest for the day. The blood clot in her lungs was making it hard for her to breathe deeply. There was concern over this, but she had treatments, exercises, and was on Oxygen. But the CO2 levels in her built up and turned her blood acidic, resulting in heart failure.

She has been critical, but stable ever sense. The day after they lowered her sedation to make sure she was still responsive. She was quick to look around, recognize voices, and give some hand squeezes if she wasn’t too tired. So I know she is still there. The doctors say that is good and bad. She is aware of what’s going on as we have to make decisions for her. And these decisions are hard. The oncologist doesn’t think she will recover enough to get chemo. The Pulmonary doctor says the breathing tube can’t come out because she can’t breathe deeply. Some doctors give us a little hope here and there. But they might just be being nice. Other doctors telling us that there is no chance and the sooner we stop treatment the better it is for her. And every day we wait gets worse and worse. That cancer is still in there destroying what it can.

Finally today we meet with the doctor that helped us get through the first blood clot. She was the best then and explaining everything. We had been hoping to hear from her again. She gathered us all up and sat down with us to explain the whole picture to us. Give us every bit of information and stitch it into place. So we can see just how sick she has become. What kind of life she could expect if we followed various paths. She spent a lot of time with us answering all our questions about why we couldn’t hope on one thing or another. She related with us on a personal level. She did point out that things happen and they could be proven wrong, but with all the information she saw and gave us. We won’t be moving passed where we are now. She was very good at explaining what happens if we want to focus on quality of life as well. We have a very good understanding on what next. She left us to talk and figure it out without any rush or hurry. It’s our decision to make when we are ready.

Part of this story I left out are all the people. Her mother, sister, father, step-mother, aunts and uncles.  An amazing amount of friends and coworkers. Each one of them remind me of how well loved she is.

22,I’m so scared all the time.,"Last November I (25F) went in to the hospital and was told I had a tumor growing on the edge of my liver. This year it was complete removed and they eventually told me it was cancerous. I don’t completely understand if they are just lying to me but I had such a rare cancer they don’t completely understand it or why it happen. So they told me they removed the cancerous tumor and I was fine now. I’ll be fine and I just have to go in for a scan every few months. I’m in constant fear it’s going to come back or the cancer is still there. No one in my family has cancer. So why did it grow in the first place. Just cause they took it out what makes me think it’s not gonna grow right back? I’m scare everytime I slightly get sick because what If these are signs it’s back. What if it comes back any day. I’m constantly scared of this. I can’t talk to my mom because she gets mad when I talk like that and makes me drop it. I don’t want to talk to my friends cause I can tell it makes then very uncomfortable. This is just all I think about and I don’t have any one to talk to. What am I suppose to do?

24,On The Outside Looking In,"My ex boyfriends dad was diagnosed with brain cancer two weeks ago. I just found out he has about 3-6 months. My ex and I haven't been in each other's lives much but three weeks before he found out I had reached out to him and told him I was still in love with him. It was an overwhelming three weeks and we were trying to figure out if we could make us work again. Then all this happened with his dad. I figured talks of us wouldn't be a priority for a while which is obviously fine and understandable. I just want to be there for him and his family and support him however I can. His family doesn't know that we've been talking though. A few days ago he told me he can't get attached to me. I asked if he wanted me out of his life and he said yes but I could call him every few days to check on him. I'm more than happy to do that because I do love him and want to give him whatever support I can. 

I just feel so alone. It may seem selfish but when we were together his dad was like a dad to me. I'm so sad about this diagnosis. Already I was on the outside, unable to do anything to help because his parents didn't know I was kind of back in his life. But now, even more so, I'm on the outside. I can't even talk to him daily. I have no one to grieve with. I'm not even part of the situation. I'm at a complete loss of how to cope and deal with this. I really want to be with him and go through this situation with him. I'm also hurt that he doesn't want me in his life to help deal with everything. I know that's less important considering the gravity of his dad's cancer, but it's just so confusing. Why wouldn't someone want love and support? Even if it is from an ex? We both love each other. There are just complications surrounding our relationship. So why would he push me away? 

I feel very selfish feeling all of this. But I also feel like I have no one to talk to and I don't know how to deal with this. 

Any advice, insights, support, etc? I've also been looking for support groups that I could attend (whether in person or online or whatever) but I'm very confused on how to find one, if anyone knows how.",7.0,"['on', 'outside', 'looking', 'ex', 'friends', 'famrel', 'diagnosed', 'brain', 'cancer', 'number', 'weeks', 'ago', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'has', 'about', 'digit', 'months', 'ex', 'have not', 'been', 'each', 'others', 'lives', 'much', 'number', 'weeks', 'before', 'found', 'out', 'had', 'reached', 'out', 'love', 'overwhelming', 'number', 'weeks', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'could', 'make', 'work', 'again', 'all', 'happened', 'famrel', 'figured', 'talks', 'would not', 'priority', 'while', 'obviously', 'fine', 'understandable', 'just', 'want', 'there', 'family', 'support', 'however', 'family', 'does not', 'know', 'we have', 'been', 'talking', 'though', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'can not', 'get', 'attached', 'asked', 'wanted', 'out', 'life', 'said', 'yes', 'could', 'call', 'every', 'few', 'days', 'check', 'on', 'I am', 'more', 'than', 'happy', 'do', 'because', 'do', 'love', 'want', 'give', 'whatever', 'support', 'just', 'feel', 'so', 'alnumber', 'month', 'selfish', 'when', 'together', 'famrel', 'like', 'famrel', 'I am', 'so', 'sad', 'about', 'diagnosis', 'already', 'on', 'outside', 'unable', 'do', 'anything', 'help', 'because', 'parents', 'did not', 'know', 'kind', 'back', 'life', 'now', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'I am', 'on', 'outside', 'can not', 'even', 'talk', 'daily', 'no', 'number', 'grieve', 'I am', 'not', 'even', 'part', 'situation', 'I am', 'complete', 'loss', 'how', 'cope', 'deal', 'want', 'through', 'situation', 'I am', 'also', 'hurt', 'does not', 'want', 'life', 'help', 'deal', 'everything', 'know', 'that is', 'less', 'important', 'considering', 'gravity', 'famrels', 'cancer', 'just', 'so', 'confusing', 'why', 'would not', 'somenumber', 'want', 'love', 'support', 'even', 'ex', 'both', 'love', 'each', 'other', 'there', 'just', 'complications', 'surrounding', 'relationship', 'so', 'why', 'would', 'push', 'away', 'feel', 'selfish', 'feeling', 'all', 'also', 'feel', 'like', 'no', 'number', 'talk', 'do not', 'know', 'how', 'deal', 'any', 'advice', 'insights', 'support', 'etc', 'I have', 'also', 'been', 'looking', 'support', 'groups', 'could', 'atnumberd', 'whether', 'perfamrel', 'online', 'whatever', 'I am', 'confused', 'on', 'how', 'find', 'number', 'anynumber', 'knows', 'how']",on outside looking ex friends famrel diagnosed brain cancer number weeks ago just found out has about digit months ex have not been each others lives much number weeks before found out had reached out love overwhelming number weeks trying figure out could make work again all happened famrel figured talks would not priority while obviously fine understandable just want there family support however family does not know we have been talking though few days ago can not get attached asked wanted out life said yes could call every few days check on I am more than happy do because do love want give whatever support just feel so alnumber month selfish when together famrel like famrel I am so sad about diagnosis already on outside unable do anything help because parents did not know kind back life now even more so I am on outside can not even talk daily no number grieve I am not even part situation I am complete loss how cope deal want through situation I am also hurt does not want life help deal everything know that is less important considering gravity famrels cancer just so confusing why would not somenumber want love support even ex both love each other there just complications surrounding relationship so why would push away feel selfish feeling all also feel like no number talk do not know how deal any advice insights support etc I have also been looking support groups could atnumberd whether perfamrel online whatever I am confused on how find number anynumber knows how

26,2020 destroyed my family (vent),"I live in the US with my husband and my parents lived in Brazil. Back in the beginning of July my dad fell ill with what we thought was covid-19. He had all the symptoms and ended up going to the hospital on July 11th. I was on a video call with him trying to calm him down until the paramedics arrived. He couldn’t breathe, It was the most terrifying thing I’ve ever seen in my life. He made a joke as he was leaving and I said “I love you”. I had a panic attack as soon as he was taken by the paramedics. July 16th I landed in Brazil to support my mom(71yo) and wait for my Dad(68) to come out of the hospital. 

While he was at the hospital I took my mother to a Pulmonologist to investigate her breathing, her family doctor suspected she had COPD. 
July 31st my Dad passed away from sepsis after a failed attempt to drain a large abscess in his liver that wasn’t discovered in time, because the doctors thought it was something viral.

3 days after my dad’s death we had an appointment to check my mom’s results. Turns out she had a large tumor in her lung that had already metastasized and also Lymphangitis. Her diagnosis is stage IV squamous lung carcinoma. I’m watching my mom suffer everyday. 

I couldn’t allow myself to mourn my Dad so my mom wouldn’t worry about me. She is the kind of mom that worries more about my afflictions than her own. Now I need to be even stronger not to fall apart because I am her only caregiver.

I am so numb, I cry sometimes but I just feel this dark pit inside of me.People try to talk to me. Ask how I’m doing... I don’t know.. I just lost my dad, he was the best person ever, I couldn’t hug him or say goodbye in person, now I am here watching my mom struggle to breathe, asking God to kill her soon so she doesn’t suffer. I feel powerless, horrible, depressed.

My mom always said that dying without being able to breathe was the most terrifying thing for her, probably the worst way to go after being burned alive. 
And that is exactly what is happening to her. She is terrified. 

She did her first chemotherapy treatment this week and she came out worse than she was going in. 
She doesn’t know what to do. If she should continue the treatment and feel this way with a slim hope of the tumor shrinking or just medicate the pain and wait for her to go.

I don’t know what to say...
I wish the treatment would work, but I don’t know if it will. So I’m afraid of saying she should do it.
But at the same time I’m afraid of telling her not to and missing out a chance to feel a little better.


My father-in-law passed away last year of Lung cancer as well, and before he passed he said if he could go back in time, he wouldn’t have done chemo.
He suffered so much... I’m lost.

27,Update: Husband may be in the last phase and goes back and forth about dying,"So, he has lung cancer and has decided to do radiation; however, while when he had the head and neck cancer, he had 33 5 minute radiations, and this time he will have 5 30 minute radiation sessions, which I am VERY frightened of, as it seems like he will have the same side effects as the first one.  We have to drive 2.5 miles every other day in order to do the radiation session, and I know that this will be tough.

While his doctors, therapists, etc., are helping me, they are talking about Quality rather than Quantity at this point, which I know is what we are looking at, truthfully.  I don't tell him, because he is not ready to hear this, he will talk a little, but then he will clam up and I just let it lie.

Good things are he has gained a couple of pounds, which is good, but I am afraid that when he is under radiation it will get bad again.

29,I FINALLY GET TO TAKE A BREAK FROM CANCER!!!,"A bit of background:

I am 32 years old, male, stage 2B invasive ductal carcinoma, non genetic - grade 2, ER+, HER2-

I had an inverted nipple for most of my life  (I would say atleast since mid teens, maybe since I was in early 20's I remember it a good portion of my life, just never put much focus on it )- thought it was normal and decided to get it checked out last year - I am ""happy"" I did, because it turned out to be cancer and it finally attacked a lymphnode.

November: 2019 - First Mammogram, ultrasound was done shortly after. They found a suspicious lump (not to me I've known about it for years just never got it checked out) - so they wanted to do a needle biopsy - which can be described as OW!!!!! (literally not enough novacane or whatever they use in the world to numb the area - felt like a wolf took a bite under my skin - they had to do it 3 times!!!)

&#x200B;

December 2nd, 2019 - get results - listed originally at the beginning of the post.  I get the call during work, busiest time of our year. I literally take the call while I am doing paperwork - once it dies down and I hang up the phone I tell my boss what I was told. Oddly enough I felt nothing, no grief, no anger just ""you got cancer"" It had the same inflection as ""the sky is blue"" or ""the sky is up"" .... yup sure is and water is wet. I was informed I should tell HR and did, I wasn't even aware what wild ride would happen over the next few months. I had no idea what was going to happen - I couldn't even comprehend it. I know surgery was mandatory, aside from that I knew nothing else. Sure watching TV shows you ""think"" you know, but shows like Breaking Bad are just over done for theatrics.

&#x200B;

Mid December - Followed by preop appointments, genetic testing, and physical therapy information. Along with meeting my surgeon and cancer team.

&#x200B;

January 9th - Mastectomy is finished followed by 2 weeks of recovery.

&#x200B;

February 13th - surgery for a chemo port is to be put in, followed by 4 sessions of chemo starting the next day. Dates are: Feb 14,  March 6th and 27th, April 17th

&#x200B;

May 11th - April 22nd - radiation Mon - Fri after work (feeling the affects now, chest is beat red, pealing, and burns when I move). Followed by an appointment with my radiation doctor right after my final appt. With oncologist as well telling me I need 5 years of temoxofin - with a surprise visit from my surgeon.....scheduling my port removal this weds.

&#x200B;

July 1st - MY CHEMO PORT IS REMOVED!!!

&#x200B;

July 8th - VACATION BEGINS THE MOMENT I CLOCK OUT OF WORK

&#x200B;

Sept I see my oncologist again.

&#x200B;

After 6 months of this madness I finally get my staycation!!! 2 weeks away from work and the fucking hospital. No more time is being stolen from me. No MORE: Surgeries, Chemo taking 4 hours of my life and the next day with it, Radiation EVERY DAMN DAY M-F......I get 2 weeks by myself doing exactly what I WANT!!!

&#x200B;

I will be selfish, I will not care at all about another human being, it will be ME, ME, ME!! IF I WANT TO DO SOMETHING I....WILL....FUCKING...DO...IT!!! If I want to eat a large pizza on the couch and drink beer while I binge watch New Girl, The Office (never seen it....seeing what the craze is about), or any show my heart desires - or a video game...I WILL DO IT!! If I want to read a book I will do it. I need this vacation I have had enough of this horse shit. FUCK YOU CANCER

&#x200B;

FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUHHHHHH UUUUUHHH UUUUUUHHHH CCCKKKKKKK .... YOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU CAAAAAANCERRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUUUUUUU UUUUHHHH CCCKKKK YOOOUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!

&#x200B;

I have so many ideas I want to pursue:

&#x200B;

I want to play Civ 6 on Diety

&#x200B;

I'd love to binge watch tv shows I kept putting off.

&#x200B;

Read the first book of GoT

&#x200B;

I know boredom will settle in on day 6 roughly......but damn I will take it! If I just ""zone out"" for a bit because I ran out of stimuli then so be it....it will pass - I am tired of work and the fucking hospital stealing time from me.

&#x200B;

I know I wrote alot on the subject but I just had to vent. I know I will never get a true break from cancer, for the rest of my life I will need to be on the lookout....but damn 2 weeks of a ""die down"" is all worth it.",1.0,"['finally', 'get', 'take',

30,Mylittlebro_ka,"Today Mark's the first day that my brother starts his chemotherapy, the doctors have said he will undertake first a surgery to install a device so he can receive his chemo. I went and saw him with my cousin and his girlfriend. When I first walked in it and saw him I was distraught to see my brother hooked up to these machines telling me he's happy to see me. I was at a loss of words with my parents. I could tell that it was already taking its toll on them, my mom with her sandbags I could tell she hasn't slept and her eyes were swollen from the crying and frustration. My dad looked the same with this utterly beaten down look like he was trying hard to stay calm when he couldn't, the man who I once always saw with this smooth look of cold where you knew that everything would turn alright as long as you are with him. It has been eating at me seeing my precious family like this but I know that I have to stay strong and be the the strong beam of emotional support for them. I have resolved myself to understand that no matter how many oceans full of tears I could shed, it won't wake me up from this nightmare. I comforted my father by telling him that no matter what we have to be the ones to stay positive and show him that no matter what comes we can bulldoze through this. I know that this journey is gonna be long and rough. I'm going to have to take it day by day, step by step and stay positive.  As I'm here laying in bed, I'm praying for the success of my brothers recovery and I'm writing this as a journey for him to read later on. Little bro I want you to know that when you read this it will be cause you did it, and I am proud of you! I probably lied to you a lot cause I'll be honest but until you I see you at 100% I will depressed and probably will cru behind closed doors cause I won't be able let you see me in this state. This next 2 years I'll be the best brother and know that every decision I take will be for you! I love you and I treasure you more than I let on but that's only cause I have to sometimes be the bad guy and be mean but know I only do it cause I think it will better you!

31,"Mom has cancer... angry, frustrated, scared. (Long rant-y post).","In early March, my mom went to the hospital because she had dangerously low potassium. She was in there for a couple weeks because complications and at one point they decided to do a colonoscopy. She got to come home, but last week they told her the results were that she had colon cancer. They said there was a large effected area, but that it don't think it's aggressive and believe they have a chance to remove it all with surgery. She's scheduled in for April 24th.  I'm hopeful that the surgery will remove it all and that she'll be cancer free afterwards, but I'm also nervous because the surgery is high risk for her due to her other health conditions. 

My relationship with my mother is... Complicated. She has always smoked a lot, and my paternal Nana's dying wish (like literally, she told me this the night before she died unexpectedly so it was a little eerie) was to help my mother realize that she needs to quit or otherwise it will kill her one day. I tried and tried... I would write whole multi-page essay type papers when I was 10 and slide them under her bedroom door at night, I would hide her smokes, I would spew facts about smoking and health out at random, I would tell her that I would use my allowance to buy her nicorette patches or gum or whatever. I would beg.... But she wouldn't listen. After years of trying, I'll admit I gave up. 

 When I was 12-15, she struggled with alcoholism and depression. This was a very difficult time for me as a tween/young teenage girl. I would come home and find her passed out on the floor (she was unemployed) and have to help her up the stairs to her room. I was always scared opening the house door after school, that she would fall down the stairs one day while and I'd find her dead. I always made sure I walked into the house before my little brother, just in case. When she was awake, she was a mean drunk and we'd fight often. She went to the hospital psych ward twice for a couple months. 

When I was 16, she started getting a little better. Things were pretty okay for a few years, but she never physically recovered from the damage she did to her body over those years (all she did was smoke and drink - many days she ate nothing), hence her underlying conditions that make the surgery such a risk. 

When I was 20ish, she left to live with my Nana (not the one who passed, this one was her mother) in another city. During this time, I hardly saw her. Maybe 3/4 times a year, on holidays. Shortly after, I found out my Nana had cancer. My mom stayed with her during her 5 year battle with cancer, until she passed away in 2017. 

I had my daughter August 2018. My mom (who had been living in the other city) moved back in with my dad, to be closer to her granddaughter. She absolutely loves her. She has been out babysitter the last year while I was working so they spend a lot of time together (to be clear, she is no longer struggling with alcoholism).


Anyway... I love my mom, but I don't feel sad for myself if she were to pass away from this. I'd move on. I am though angry she never listened to me as a child. Angry at myself that I couldn't stop her smoking. Angry that she won't treat this as a wake up call because she's so stubborn, she 100% thinks this is hereditary and has nothing to do with her lifestyle choices. Saddened that my daughter could grow up without her grandma. Saddened that my mother will miss out on seeing my daughter grow up. I always thought my mom would die young. She's 54. 

My husband asked me how I was taking the news. I didn't know what to say. The emotions I feel are so complex. I'm trying not to think too much about it until after the surgery. We'll see what happens. It's out of my control. I can only hope for the best at this point and hope that she'll learn from this. 

I also can't believe this is happening in the middle of a global pandemic.  Not that there's ever a good time for cancer, but... It's certainly a very bad time. I'm worried a little that cancer surgeries like my mom's (non-aggressive) will be postponed and that it could spread and get worse in that time. Or that she gets COVID-19 and that could be devestating too since she's high risk for that too.

32,Scans show a stand still. Support going forward?,"Hi All,

Long time lurker here. I'm my mother's primary caregiver. She was diagnosed with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer that had spread to her liver Sept 2016. By the time we finally got the diagnosis, the oncologist said she would have only had weeks without chemo. 

Flash forward to now. From everything I've read about this disease my Mom has done pretty well. She has been on a gemzar and abraxene regimen and us starting her 9th round this week. The biggest side effect she has had from chemo has been neuropathy. She isn't mobile anymore but at least we have the pain managed. 

Every 3 months she gets scanned and the first 2 showed shrinkage in the liver. The pancreatic tumor has never really shrunk but hasn't grown either. We just got her 3rd scan today and it shows that everything is at a stand still. Nothing grew. Nothing shrank. 

For now her Dr wants to keep her in the same chemo regimen and says that unless her neuropathy really takes over he doesn't feel the need to back off on any treatment. 

I don't know what I'm looking for here. I know no one can tell me what the clock reads on a ticking time bomb. I guess I'm just wondering, in your experiences, what happened after this stand still stage? Did it last very long? Did things start to go down hill? I know your experiences my not be relative to mine. I just feel like it would help me to know what to prepare for a little more. 

Thanks in advance.

33,Support during chemo,"Hi all,

My aunt, who is living with me and my family, has decided to start chemo treatments next week for a metastatic paranasal mucosal melanoma. She is 82.

34,Fuck Muffins,"Definitely had a breakdown moment today. 

My Mom and I have been taking turns driving Dad up to Penn every single weekday for cancer treatment. On the days that I go, Dad and I have a routine. I wheel him to the cancer center, we check-in, and then I go get both of us coffees and muffins from Starbucks while he waits to be seen. He always gets a warm blueberry muffin and an Americano. I usually return - snacks in hand - before he even leaves the waiting room. Well... the woman in front of me at Starbucks today bought the last blueberry muffin. The cashier checked the back. Checked the front. Muffinless. 

""My Dad's in treatment for cancer and this muffin is the one thing he looks forward to about coming up here"" I stammer over the giant lump in my throat. Tears begin to roll down my face. I'm turning beet red. I'm losing control. I'm overwhelmed. I'm angry. I'm sad. My emotions are bubbling over. The cashier apologizes profusely, obviously uncomfortable about my impending emotional outburst. I settle for a blueberry scone, give her my money, and immediately scramble to the corner of the room where I hide my face and wipe my tears... embarrassed. 

I feel a hand on my shoulder. I look up to find a middle aged black woman in business attire staring down at me. ""I just wanna give you a hug."" she says. I melt into her embrace as she soothes me saying ""I know honey, it's hard. I lost my father to cancer last year. It's okay to cry. It's okay to feel. You'll be okay. There are just some things that you can't control. Even muffins."" We part with a smile. I thank her for her kind words. She leaves with a friend, coffee in hand. 

I clean up my face. I grab our order from the barista. I go back down to the cancer center. Dad is gone, having been called for his treatment. Minutes later he's wheeled out to the waiting area by a member of the staff. I plaster a smile on my face, holding out the Starbucks goodies. We go the car. He eats his scone and never mentions the missing muffin. I don't mention my experience either. 

Huge amounts of gratitude to that business woman. I'll never know your name but I won't forget your kindness. Life is hard. We're harder.

36,Request for a better word than “fighting” cancer,"Hi

My wife passed last week after 4 long years of trying to survive a stage 4 NPC diagnosis.  During this ordeal I learned that as much as I respected and admired her for the strong and powerful lady that she was, her strength in being able to lift each foot and keep walking down the path of hope, even when hope ran out, through all the pain, fear, doubt, hope/no hope, tears, brief jubilations and always always love, grew each day.  Her example is also what is going to keep me going raising her kids.

But I was her caregiver during all of this and she asked me something that I was never able to answer.  Why do we say “fighting” cancer?  It always bothered her because to her it meant that no matter how hard you worked at getting rid of it, cancer could “win” and you’d be a “loser”.  She rejected that.  And the way I see it, she gained 4 more years with her children after being given scant months.  Cancer didn’t “win”, she didn’t “lose”, but I lack the vocabulary.  She never let cancer define who she was.  She never let anyone define who she was.  She simply was her.  And I miss her greatly as do her kids.

Does anyone have alternative vocabulary to “fighting” cancer?",8.0,"['request', 'better', 'word', 'than', '“fighting”', 'cancer', 'famrel', 'passed', 'last', 'week', 'after', 'digit', 'long', 'years', 'trying', 'survive', 'stage', 'digit', 'npc', 'diagnosis', 'during', 'ordeal', 'learned', 'much', 'respected', 'admired', 'strong', 'powerful', 'lady', 'strength', 'being', 'able', 'lift', 'each', 'foot', 'keep', 'walking', 'down', 'path', 'hope', 'even', 'when', 'hope', 'ran', 'out', 'through', 'all', 'pain', 'fear', 'doubt', 'hopeno', 'hope', 'tears', 'brief', 'jubilations', 'always', 'always', 'love', 'grew', 'each', 'day', 'example', 'also', 'going', 'keep', 'going', 'raising', 'kids', 'caregiver', 'during', 'all', 'asked', 'something', 'never', 'able', 'answer', 'why', 'do', 'say', '“fighting”', 'cancer', 'always', 'bothered', 'because', 'meant', 'no', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'worked', 'getting', 'rid', 'cancer', 'could', '“win”', 'you would', '“loser”', 'rejected', 'way', 'see', 'gained', 'digit', 'more', 'years', 'children', 'after', 'being', 'given', 'scant', 'months', 'cancer', 'did not', '“win”', 'did not', '“lose”', 'lack', 'vocabulary', 'never', 'let', 'cancer', 'define', 'never', 'let', 'anynumber', 'define', 'simply', 'miss', 'greatly', 'do', 'kids', 'does', 'anynumber', 'alternative', 'vocabulary', '“fighting”', 'cancer']",request better word than “fighting” cancer famrel passed last week after digit long years trying survive stage digit npc diagnosis during ordeal learned much respected admired strong powerful lady strength being able lift each foot keep walking down path hope even when hope ran out through all pain fear doubt hopeno hope tears brief jubilations always always love grew each day example also going keep going raising kids caregiver during all asked something never able answer why do say “fighting” cancer always bothered because meant no matter how hard worked getting rid cancer could “win” you would “loser” rejected way see gained digit more years children after being given scant months cancer did not “win” did not “lose” lack vocabulary never let cancer define never let anynumber define simply miss greatly do kids does anynumber alternative vocabulary “fighting” cancer
37,"American patients, you really have my sympathies","So in terms of cancer I am completely fucked. But I saw my doctor today and he told me about a new drug, not a miracle drug that would drastically improve my life but one that would definitely make me more comfortable and give me more freedom. One issue though, the drug isn't wildly available on the NHS, its only given out under strict parameters and I don't meet them. In order to get this drug I have to pay two grand per injection and would need an injection every few weeks. Which is completely unrealistic for me and I can't justify dropping that amount of money on a dead girl even if its just once. I don't think I could pay it once. This conversation unsurprisingly made me feel really shit. It really sucks to find out that there is a drug out there which will help you feel better but you can't afford to get it. So I just want to take a moment to address all the American patients and say that I am so fucking SORRY that your medical shit is accompanied by bills all the fucking time. I am so sorry that you are dealing with fucking cancer and you're having to figure out the fucking financial bullshit at the same time. I am so sorry

Some of my relatives are calling/ WhatsApping and asking about her health 5-6 times a day. I don’t mind them telling but this constant messaging and calling all the time has started to irritate us. And not one of them has offered any kind of support (financially or such). Some of them start telling us about their health problems, like how they have fever or a fucking high BP and how because of covid they are not going anywhere outside. My mother was fine two months back and this has come as a sudden shock and we are still trying to cope. I don’t know what is the appropriate way of telling them that it is not okay to constantly call us and ask about her health because this is a stage iv cancer. She had a brain surgery and has HD stitches on her half shaven head. She is fine as much as she can be, and vedio calling and talking to her is not helping us.

42,My dad passed away tonight.," My outstanding 61 year old father had stage 4 colon cancer for two and a half years. It spread to his peritoneal lining which doctors kept telling us is harder to treat than if it were on a vital organ. We all kept positive throughout that time. My dad especially. He’s a tough as nails USMC vet who never complained, never gave up and always gave us so much love. Endless love. It doesn’t feel real. Me and my mom were lucky enough to be there with him and hold his hands, telling him how much we love him and that we’ll be okay without him. I kept crying on and off. He originally went to the ER yesterday for a bowel obstruction, uncontrollably committing the entire night and day. Then the palliative care doctor called me around 3 PM. It happened so fast. He had an oxygen mask on and wasn’t receiving fluids since it was filling up his lungs and his heart wasn’t responding well to it. I knew he hated the mask. I asked him to confirm if he wanted hospice care, he nodded his head. He knew it was the end. I did too. My mom was more in shock, in denial of it. As soon as they removed the oxygen mask and put an oxygen tube through his nose (cannula I think,) his breathing immediately shortened and shallowed. He couldn’t breathe on his own. They gave him morphine, so he wasn’t in any pain. The sweet nurse offered him a Coke, but he was too weak. The palliative care doctor was very kind to my family and my dad as well, which I’m so appreciative of. My mom held his hand the entire time while praying with him. Then my dad suddenly stopped breathing. I know people always say “it happened so fast,” but it’s taken me enduring this to realize it’s true. Time wasn’t real in the hospital. They were supposed to move him to an upper floor, but we stayed with him in the dark ER room. When I realized how quickly he stopped breathing, I panicked and ran outside to the nurse station just shouting that my dad stopped breathing. Three of them came inside and immediacy began doing CPR, and my mom started bawling. I’ve never ever seen my mom cry like that before. My sadness turned into shock, and I wrapped my arms around my mom to comfort her while she sobbed. She was staring the whole time as they were trying to revive him. I told her to look away if it was too hard. I was crying a little bit, but knew I needed to comfort her. I’m still shocked. I went through his cellphone and found old videos and pictures of me and him. They made me breakdown. It dawned on me that I’ll never get a text from him again. Never go to the grocery store with him again. Never get advice from him again. Never hear his dark, yet endearing marine humor again. It feels like I’m not living my own life. I’m going through the motions. I’m scared of the future. I’m 20 years old, barely about to begin college this fall. My brother is only 15. My boyfriend is also in the Marine Corp, and only got to meet my dad once last year. It’s all so confusing and I feel lost and broken. I know with time me and my family will be okay again. But a part of me has died with my dad. The only thing that gives me peace is knowing he wasn’t in pain when he went, and that he’s no longer suffering but whole again in the kingdom of heaven. If anyone out there is going through something similar, or if you’re blessed enough to have your loved one still alive and breathing, please be with them. Take pictures of them and with them. Take videos. Record their voice. Tell them you love them. Life can be cruel and short for some. I never thought I wouldn’t have my dad around at 20 years old. I’m his girl. He taught me so much and loved me so much and I’ll strive everyday to be the kind of person he’d be proud of. I’m sorry if this post is all over the place. My brain is hazy right now. Sending my love out there to everyone being affected by this ugly, unfair disease.

43,Trying to be strong.,"Currently in the process of losing my aunt to brain cancer, she brought me up from a young age, but she had two children both older than me, but she was a single mother for the most part, so they're taking it hard. I'm trying to be strong to be there for them as support but I feel so alone even though my family and bf are so supportive and caring. I'm broken hearted after seeing her for the first fime since properly getting sick. Unfortunately the cancer has spread and she doesn't even look like herself. I'm falling to piece but feel like I can't grieve right now.

44,Begging for Information (long),"First, I’m glad to have found this subreddit. On to my post. My mom was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer in January. It has been a whirlwind since. Between hospital stays, finding other issues and covid, 2020 has been a great year. But the reasoning for my post. 

My parents and I have a strained relationship. My Dad worked nights my entire childhood and wasn’t around for a lot of life lessons. My Mom did everything right, but was never the type to accept the faults she had. When she was diagnosed, I was not told officially until two weeks after her initial diagnosis. Even though I already knew from hearing from the doctors and being able to put 2 and 2 together. I.e the floor she was on in the hospital. Who her doctor was and what their specialty was. Gotta love the internet. My family for whatever reason does not share info real well. Both of my parents want to keep everything close to chest. Which I totally understand wanting to keep things private but neither one of them have a real strong support group to lean on. Believe me, I’ve tried. Two weeks ago, I believe Mom had a stroke. The last few visits, she’s barely acknowledged me and my daughter being there and is pretty much nonverbal. She’s able to say a yes/no but that’s about it. Since all this began in January, I’ve been locked out from meetings with doctors, I haven’t been able to take her to treatments or just been able to be there. I call and text almost daily. And I get very little back. I just want to know how my mother is doing. I know my time with her is limited.

46,We lost him,"On the 6th, my father passed away because of cancer. He showed absolutely no symptoms when he was diagnosed with Stage IV Colon and Liver cancer a few months ago. It was terrible watching him suffer, but I guess it is over now. I am having a really hard time accepting his fate. He was 49 when he died. I am his only son, and I am 20. My sister is a little younger than me. The first two days, I didn't feel upset at all. I felt fine. I was relieved that he wasn't in pain anymore, and felt that the end of his life was for the better since he wouldn't be suffering anymore. I am not sure why, but last night I fell apart. 

I miss him so much already. It really is the little things that get to you. I miss saying hello and goodbye to him. I miss hearing his voice, seeing him in his spot on the couch, just having him around. I thought I was at peace with his passing when I was in the hospital with him. He held off medication when he was admitted a few days before his death just to have one final conversation with me, and that conversation means more to me than I can explain. I am very fortunate to have had that real goodbye to him, and I know that. 

I am having a lot of trouble coping with it. I understand his death, but I don't like the uncertainty of the future. I'm not sure what the next month will be like, and that is really hard for me. I love him and am happy he is no longer suffering. It's what he wanted. No one should go through the pain he was in at the end. I wonder how long it will be before I fully adjust to the new reality. 

I am trying to make things as normal as possible. I can adapt to the changes like him not being around, as long as that is the only element that changed. If I take it as one challenge at a time, it is much easier for me to adjust. One problem is that family keeps visiting. They are not normally around, so adapting to my new home life is harder with all of these outside elements involved. I get that they are there because they care and all that, but it makes the grieving process more complicated when my house is full of people who don't usually go there. 

It's a hard time. However, it is my reality, and i have no choice but to overcome this.

49,My(16) Mom(49) Has Cancer,"To be quite honest, I never really considered venting to others going through the same thing as me. But after a certain point, I realized my friends may not be able to understand and I might make them uncomfortable.
  In July, my mom had felt around her breasts and had found a mysterious lump. She went to the doctor, and after a biopsy and ect, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Thankfully, she found it so early that it wasn’t even at stage 1. So she had surgery a month later and got it removed, and I thought “thank god, it’s over.”
  Oh boy was I mistaken.
 Yesterday, I came home after a school club trip, only to find my mom trying to stop crying while my father consoled her. Honestly, I thought nothing of it (of course I cared though) as she tends to breakdown and cry quite often. She told me to tell her about my day, which I did but she kept crying through it. I knew something was up.
   After incessantly asking her what was wrong, she told me the Cancer is still there, and got worse. “It’s an aggressive type,” She said, “I start chemo in a week or so, and I’ll be doing it for 4 months followed by radiation. I’m also taking a year off work.” She also explained her survival rate was high. 
   I think after a few months of dealing with this, everything sort of hit me. I started crying the hardest I’ve ever cried—I was scared. I had seen my grandma survive cancer only for it to comeback and watch her die. Same with my two grandfathers. In that moment, everything I saw came back and I saw it in my mom. For the first time in a while, I had a panic attack, I couldn’t stop hyperventilating and crying. I wanted to be strong for my mom but just...I’m terrified. She’s the only person I have full support from in this house, and I love her so much.

50,34 M Stage 4 Lung Cancer,"Hello everyone, 

I'm a 34 M who was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer in May of this year.  The cancer is in my left lung, but has moved to my lymph nodes in my chest. The largest tumor in my chest was a 3 by 4 inch tumor around a node.  Being so young and with very little symptoms, several doctors gave me anywhere from 1-2 years. Within one month I was coughing non stop, and breathing was becoming difficult. 

I have just completed 6 rounds of chemo and immune therapy, a drug called Keytruda over an 18 week period. CT Scans after only 4 rounds showed a decrease in all my tumors of at least 50% and in some cases the tumors were gone completely. The doctors called this a partial response, and were super happy.  My cough and breathing problems have gone as well. 

As it stands now I will continue treatments every 3 weeks for the next two years, if I make it that long. I've had almost no side effects from the chemo, or therapy except for a bit of flu like symptoms for a few days after each round. 

Anyway, my support group is very small so I just wanted to share my experience so far.  I'm not really sure how to feel at this point, I'm happy I am experiencing some relief, but I know it's not forever.",0.0,"['digit', 'm', 'stage', 'digit', 'lung', 'cancer', 'everynumber', 'I am', 'digit', 'm', 'diagnosed', 'advanced', 'lung', 'cancer', 'month', 'year', 'cancer', 'left', 'lung', 'has', 'moved', 'lymph', 'nodes', 'chest', 'largest', 'tumor', 'chest', 'digit', 'digit', 'inch', 'tumor', 'around', 'node', 'being', 'so', 'young', 'little', 'symptoms', 'several', 'doctors', 'gave', 'anywhere', 'digit', 'years', 'within', 'number', 'month', 'coughing', 'non', 'stop', 'breathing', 'becoming', 'difficult', 'just', 'completed', 'digit', 'rounds', 'chemo', 'immune', 'therapy', 'drug', 'called', 'keytruda', 'over', 'digit', 'week', 'period', 'ct', 'scans', 'after', 'only', 'digit', 'rounds', 'showed', 'decrease', 'all', 'tumors', 'least', 'digit', 'some', 'cases', 'tumors', 'gnumber', 'completely', 'doctors', 'called', 'partial', 'response', 'super', 'happy', 'cough', 'breathing', 'problems', 'gnumber', 'well', 'stands', 'now', 'will', 'continue', 'treatments', 'every', 'digit', 'weeks', 'next', 'number', 'years', 'make', 'long', 'I have', 'had', 'no', 'side', 'effects', 'chemo', 'therapy', 'except', 'bit', 'flu', 'like', 'symptoms', 'few', 'days', 'after', 'each', 'round', 'anyway', 'support', 'group', 'small', 'so', 'just', 'wanted', 'share', 'experience', 'so', 'far', 'I am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'feel', 'point', 'I am', 'happy', 'experiencing', 'some', 'relief', 'know', 'not', 'forever']",digit m stage digit lung cancer everynumber I am digit m diagnosed advanced lung cancer month year cancer left lung has moved lymph nodes chest largest tumor chest digit digit inch tumor around node being so young little symptoms several doctors gave anywhere digit years within number month coughing non stop breathing becoming difficult just completed digit rounds chemo immune therapy drug called keytruda over digit week period ct scans after only digit rounds showed decrease all tumors least digit some cases tumors gnumber completely doctors called partial response super happy cough breathing problems gnumber well stands now will continue treatments every digit weeks next number years make long I have had no side effects chemo therapy except bit flu like symptoms few days after each round anyway support group small so just wanted share experience so far I am not sure how feel point I am happy experiencing some relief know not forever

For the past month she has been expressing to just me how worried she was that it came back, and I feel like all I have been able to say was “Mom its okay you are clear”. I was so scared what would happen if I was wrong. Her doctors appointment with the results of her scans came back today CLEAR! I am so happy and thankful its been so hard watching her go through this battle especially since she has always been so strong, and seeing her open up to me how SCARED she was is the hardest part. Now its just time to get her to open up to the fact that she is a Cancer survivor because she hides it, and has a lot of “shame” towards it. She doesn’t want to be felt bad for ever so we weren’t able to tell anybody for a long time.

52,Time is getting short,"My wife had a oncology appointment last Thursday on the 11th.  We both had a feeling of dread going into this appointment.  Over the last few months her recovery time from the chemo has been getting worse and worse.  This last treatment she never truly recovered from.  There was not a single day we would call a ""good"" day even by our lowered standards over the past 4 weeks.  Further more she had been experiencing more pain in her back and a tightness in her abdomen. So we went in to this appointment with the anticipation that her cancer was growing again and that she was also getting toxic from nine months of continuous chemo.

&#x200B;

We waited in the room for 45 minutes as the doctor was running behind.  When he walked into the room you knew immediately he did not have good news for us by his demeanor.  He was kind as always, but had to be direct concerning the scans.   The cancer in her spine is growing and has spread.  The cancer in her liver grew with numerous new tumors that were all almost 0.8cm in size.  The worst part was that her bilirubin count, which had always been stable, doubled in between her last two bloodwork samples.  This concerned him the most.  We were not four minutes into the meeting when he looked at her and said, ""Unfortunately I think we are at the point I have to ask you if your affairs are in order.""  Needless to say it was a gut punch for both of us.

&#x200B;

Basically she is a time bomb right now.  Her liver is starting to fail.  The tumors could grow and block the ducts or the tumors could just grow and cause the liver to stop functioning.  The increased bilirubin counts indicates that is starting to happen.  We go back in two weeks for more bloodwork and to visit the oncologist.  The oncologist said that if those numbers continue to rise dramatically we will likely have to make some hard choices at that visit.  

&#x200B;

Honestly the choices are not that hard.  There is another chemo we can try, but if it's going to only buy her time where she's miserable and unable to function she is not interested in that.  She is not strong enough for chemo now.  So we are taking two more weeks off of chemotherapy and will decide if we are permanently discontinuing at the next meeting.  

&#x200B;

Cancer just sucks.   We knew this was coming.  But knowing does nothing to lessen the emotional impact of knowing that the time is here.",6.0,"['time', 'getting', 'short', 'famrel', 'had', 'oncology', 'appointment', 'last', 'dayofweek', 'on', 'digitth', 'both', 'had', 'feeling', 'dread', 'going', 'appointment', 'over', 'last', 'few', 'months', 'recovery', 'time', 'chemo', 'has', 'been', 'getting', 'worse', 'worse', 'last', 'treatment', 'never', 'truly', 'recovered', 'there', 'not', 'single', 'day', 'would', 'call', 'good', 'day', 'even', 'lowered', 'standards', 'over', 'past', 'digit', 'weeks', 'further', 'more', 'had', 'been', 'experiencing', 'more', 'pain', 'back', 'tightness', 'abdomen', 'so', 'went', 'appointment', 'anticipation', 'cancer', 'growing', 'again', 'also', 'getting', 'toxic', 'number', 'months', 'continuous', 'chemo', 'xdigitb', 'waited', 'room', 'digit', 'minutes', 'doctor', 'running', 'behind', 'when', 'walked', 'room', 'knew', 'immediately', 'did', 'not', 'good', 'news', 'demeanor', 'kind', 'always', 'had', 'direct', 'concerning', 'scans', 'cancer', 'spine', 'growing', 'has', 'spread', 'cancer', 'liver', 'grew', 'numerous', 'new', 'tumors', 'all', 'digitcm', 'size', 'worst', 'part', 'bilirubin', 'count', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'stable', 'doubled', 'between', 'last', 'number', 'bloodwork', 'samples', 'concerned', 'most', 'not', 'number', 'minutes', 'meeting', 'when', 'looked', 'said', 'unfortunately', 'think', 'point', 'ask', 'affairs', 'order', 'needless', 'say', 'gut', 'punch', 'both', 'xdigitb', 'basically', 'time', 'bomb', 'right', 'now', 'liver', 'starting', 'fail', 'tumors', 'could', 'grow', 'block', 'ducts', 'tumors', 'could', 'just', 'grow', 'because', 'liver', 'stop', 'functioning', 'increased', 'bilirubin', 'counts', 'indicates', 'starting', 'happen', 'back', 'number', 'weeks', 'more', 'bloodwork', 'visit', 'oncologist', 'oncologist', 'said', 'numbers', 'continue', 'rise', 'dramatically', 'will', 'likely', 'make', 'some', 'hard', 'choices', 'visit', 'xdigitb', 'hnumberstly', 'choices', 'not', 'hard', 'there', 'another', 'chemo', 'try', 'going', 'only', 'buy', 'time', 'where', 'she is', 'miserable', 'unable', 'function', 'not', 'interested', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'chemo', 'now', 'so', 'taking', 'number', 'more', 'weeks', 'off', 'chefamrelapy', 'will', 'decide', 'permanently', 'discontinuing', 'next', 'meeting', 'xdigitb', 'cancer', 'just', 'sucks', 'knew', 'coming', 'knowing', 'does', 'nothing', 'lessen', 'emotional', 'impact', 'knowing', 'time', 'here']",time getting short famrel had oncology appointment last dayofweek on digitth both had feeling dread going appointment over last few months recovery time chemo has been getting worse worse last treatment never truly recovered there not single day would call good day even lowered standards over past digit weeks further more had been experiencing more pain back tightness abdomen so went appointment anticipation cancer growing again also getting toxic number months continuous chemo xdigitb waited room digit minutes doctor running behind when walked room knew immediately did not good news demeanor kind always had direct concerning scans cancer spine growing has spread cancer liver grew numerous new tumors all digitcm size worst part bilirubin count had always been stable doubled between last number bloodwork samples concerned most not number minutes meeting when looked said unfortunately think point ask affairs order needless say gut punch both xdigitb basically time bomb right now liver starting fail tumors could grow block ducts tumors could just grow because liver stop functioning increased bilirubin counts indicates starting happen back number weeks more bloodwork visit oncologist oncologist said numbers continue rise dramatically will likely make some hard choices visit xdigitb hnumberstly choices not hard there another chemo try going only buy time where she is miserable unable function not interested not strong enough chemo now so taking number more weeks off chefamrelapy will decide permanently discontinuing next meeting xdigitb cancer just sucks knew coming knowing does nothing lessen emotional impact knowing time here
53,"I'm in my last year of highschool, and just figured out I have cancer","I'm just posting this here because a few people have told me posting here might give me a bit of an outlet. I apologize in advance, this post is probably going to be quite mopey on my part. I'm just trying to come to terms with things, I guess. 
 Long story short, I'm lucky and my cancer is pretty treatable. Papillary thyroid cancer - the kind of thing that doesn't usually happen until someone is like 65. Getting a CT scan on the 29th of this month to figure out how far it's spread, and how much the surgeons need to remove. Doctors have all told me I'm most likely going to be okay, and I understand that. I probably won't die. My symptoms aren't that bad, just a cough that has persisted for about 3 months. By all accounts, I know I'm lucky. I just want to get that out of the way, I guess. I *know* I'm lucky and I still have never been so miserable in my life. I can't focus on my classes, and I haven't been able to sleep for about 2 weeks. When I manage to get sleep, I wake up a lot during the night and have nightmares when I fall back asleep.
I'm tired of being poked at by doctors, even though logically I'm thankful for all of them and the work they're doing. I'm just tired. And even though I know I'm in good hands, and it's very treatable, I'm fucking terrified. 

Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this, I appreciate it. I guess it's just nice to get my thoughts out in a written form, and it's nice to feel like people are listening.

55,Sad,My dad died on 11th March after a 19 year battle with metastatic prostate cancer. He was doing so well until last July when the cancer caused his hip to fracture then they decided he couldn’t have any more treatment. The last 3 months have been awful. He really did not want to die. I know no one does but he was fighting it to the end. I feel guilty because I arranged for him to have a syringe driver which I think may have hastened things. I also feel awful because at the end I wanted him to go but when he did I was just not prepared. I don’t know how to move on with my life without my dad.

56,Completely overwhelmed,"My mom has small cell lung cancer. She finished  chemo and is almost done with radiation, she actually looks great and has kept weight on. They keep thinking it’s going well and then it grows back some and it’s really unknown how long she has. I am visiting her and spending as much time as I can, we are aware this won’t be cured. It’s just a matter of how many years she might have. I am truly trying to be there for her and enjoy every moment we have left. It’s been a beautiful visit, but I can’t help but feel an underlying sadness that we have such limited moments left. I have no one to talk to and so much going on. The day before I left my fiancé had a mental breakdown and tried killing him self. I had to intervene multiple times. He has been teetering for awhile and I feel guilt for leaving him on this visit. I can’t talk to him about my mom because he is fighting his own battle. His family is aware and watching out but I feel so nervous leaving him. To top it off my sister just got out of rehab and my mom is worried, she is staying sober for now but I worry the stress of possibly losing mom will push her off the wagon. My other sister is not doing well either. This is stressful for my mom, she doesn’t want to leave them in turmoil. I have to be the strong one that’s doing well but my life is falling apart. I won’t tell her what’s going on with me and my fiancé, I need her to think one of her kids is ok. I am just so overwhelmed and alone, I promised to help my sisters but I just feel lost. I don’t know why I’m typing this really, I just need to say it, I just need to let someone know I’m drowning.

58,Fellow employee was diagnosed with cancer today. She’s already said she’s dead.....,"Background is our company health insurance sucks so none of us take it. It’s almost 50% of our check. She never signed up for individual insurance either. Open enrollment here in Illinois just ended few days ago...

She’s normally a bubbly , go get them person here at work. In the last 72 hours, she’s given up all hope of life. 2 days ago was an x-ray for a slip and fall. Yesterday evening was a scheduled biopsy. This morning, they called her back in to confirm cancer (she hasn’t said which one, but from her x-rays it looks to be lung with a growth a little bigger than a golf ball on her lower left lung) She has no family (her husband and son were killed in a accident 10 years ago and parents long deceased) We’re trying to be there, but she’s already made her life into a transaction. (I don’t have the money so I might as well just die. There’s nothing out there for anyone to help me. I’m already dead, might as well just work till it’s over-direct quotes this morning)

We want to show her there’s hope and this isn’t the end, but don’t know where to even begin. You google things and you get ads and half infos. I’m hoping reaching out to you all here could help try to find that hope. Are there ways to get her on the insurance to get the treatment she needs? Are there resources she can go to? Groups she can lean on for support and hope? 

I’ve never had to deal with anything of this magnitude in my life. I’m normally good at finding hope in dark places, but even I have a sinking feeling. Anything you all can offer to point her in the right direction is huge. Thank you  all so much.

Update: Adenocarcinoma Stage 3A was her precise diagnosis. We had a long conversation about it and we’ll be keeping her distracted at work to keep her mind busy as much as possible.

The worst thing is, he was only 18 and a couple of days before he passed we made posters to put around his room to congratulate him on his last round of chemotherapy. I'm so sorry Colin.

64,Big Shout-out to those who care for a loved one with Cancer.,"I'm sure there are many here who are caring for someone with cancer. If your struggling to stay strong, reach out to someone you love or trust. Talk to them. Let them know you need help... Don't be afraid to reach out to support services available in your local area. Here in Australia, Cancer Council offers heaps of guidence for those who provide support. For me, having to put on a smile around my wife and kids is very difficult. Trying to be positive and yet at the same time trying to hide the stress is incredibly difficult. 

My situation is as follows... My wife has suspected Kidney Cancer. The tumor discovered is approx 8cm x 7cm round on the right kidney. She's only 38. Good health, doesn't smoke drink and all that nasty stuff. Absolutely devastating. We know very little about it as yet and we don't know if it's contained to the kidney or has spread. Waiting now for surgey to remove the kidney. We also have two young children.

65,My daughter finished chemo today.,"She was diagnosed with ATRT brain cancer in February and had a full resection. She’s been on intensive chemo since then which nearly killed her but it worked. All MRI scans have been clear so far and now the next step is 6 weeks of focal radiation therapy to make sure any remaining cancer cells go back to hell.  

I feel like I should be relieved, or jumping for joy that this chapter is coming to a close but I’m terrified. Chemo was horrible in every way but it was like a security blanket - I didn’t worry so much about her cancer coming back because the treatment was so aggressive I knew the chances of recurrence were slim. Now that it’s ended I’m shitting myself. What if the next MRI shows a new tumour and we have to go through this all over again? She’s only 4. This has been the worst year of our lives and I don’t know if I’m strong enough to do it all again. 

Idk where I’m going with this. I was expecting to feel so happy when chemo finished but I feel hollow, empty and scared. We’re entering uncharted territory now and I don’t really know how to feel.

Now it’s come back with a vengeance. We thought his symptoms could’ve been covid, I wish it had been. I really don’t even know what to say or what I’m looking for, I’m a very realistic person and have little optimism for this. I came home from work expecting bad news from his tests, but not this bad.

My dad is a wonderful person, I’m just so angry with the world that this is happening to him. He’s not an expressive or emotional man, he’s stoic and hardy and an amazing dad, but now when I look at him with his now explained weight loss and diagnosis he just looks so frail and vulnerable. I don’t want him to be scared but I know he’s terrified.

67,"Lost my cousin, who was like a brother this week, and my best friend is dying in the exact same bed less than 6 days later. Both cancer.","Cancer is not only taking people I love at the moment, it is emotionally crushing me at the same time. 

  My cousin, who like I said in the title was like a brother to me. He was 42. Hodgkins disease gripped him at 10. He fought it and beat it into a remission. 28 years later he developed esophageal cancer directly related to the radiation treatments from years earlier. After having his esophagus removed he rebounded and went into remission. Flash forward to middle of last year and doctors found tumors on his spine. Tumors were removed and a new round of treatments were prescribed. After 8 months the cancer spread throughout his body. 2 weeks ago he was hospitalized with 1.5 pints of fluid around his heart. Emergency surgery removed the fluid but the damage was done. Last Sunday his heart failed and he lost his 3rd and final battle with the beast.
  Not 5 days later my best friend who is battling stage 4 liver and colon cancer sits in intensive care in the same exact bed my cousin died in less than a week before. Today I tried to go up and see him. As the doors opened to the ICU wing I saw his room with the isolation protocol sign on the door. Everything hit me at once like a freight train and I lost control of my emotions. I turned around and walked out of the hospital a broken man. I did not want him to see me upset at all because I didnt want to darken any cloud of hope he still clings to.
  About 3 hours after I couldnt take myself into my buddies room I received a call from his father. He was gone.
  6 days and my loved ones lives and my life have been torn apart from the motherfucker known as cancer. I hate you! You are a selfish prick who does not care whose life it damages and takes.
  I am completely broken right now, but you wont beat me. I have the best memories of both individuals that I will take to my grave. Finally to my friends, I miss you both.

73,"My (39F) dad(63M) has just been diagnosed with liver cancer. Both my parents won't stop smoking. I'm leaving soon, I'm scared and I don't know what to do.","I'm on mobile so sorry for the form formatting. 
I live in France and my parents live in Italy, I came last week to visit after a long period without seeing them because of the lockdown.


My dad has liver problems and hemochromatosis so his blood is taken and cheked regularly. A couple of weeks ago he had a screening and apparently a lot of values were off scale, he had an exam and they found a tumor in his liver.
I took him to the hospital on Wednesday, I wasn't inside and I just have a report of what my mom said: it is in a position where is almost impossible to operate, it has already spread a little, they are planning a therapy and meanwhile we'll see a surgeon next week to have his opinion.
My parents are both devastated and I'm scared as hell.


They've spent all their life smoking and trying to stop without much result, I thought after the news they would have at least tried to reduce. I was so wrong. 
They both usually start smoking at 9am and continue no-stop till late evening. I've talked to my mum yesterday, she said she knows they should smoke less, expecially now. Today it was like we never had that talk.
This evening after dinner my father smoked a cigarette, I didn't say anything. Just about 5 minutes after that, he had another one. When he tried to light up the third one in a row I had to tell him not to. Well, not even 5 minutes after that my mom tried to light up another one too. I feel like I have to scold them like children.

I'll leave for France in a week and I'm so scared and I don't know if there is something I can do to help them.

77,The sadness comes in cycles.,"I lost my mum almost 6 months ago to cancer, this evening I recalled back to her last 48 hours wherein we knew that we were nearing the end.

The hardest part for me was admitting to myself that I first felt relief rather than sadness when she passed. 

I was told that hearing was one of the last senses to go, I whispered to her to let go and be at peace that we would be okay. She passed a few hours later.
Tonight, just thinking about that moment broke me. 
The fact that I won’t be able to hug and kiss her again, hurts so much. 

Cancer is fucking horrible, it took my mum before she got to see me graduate, hold my future kids, see me get married and most of all - it took her away before I had a chance to repay her for all she’s done for me. 

I miss you mum, love you forever.

78,Mom has multiple forms of cancer. I need to vent.,"UPDATE: things happened, we ended up in the ER last week. MRI revealed a spine COVERED with deposits. Her time is now reduced to weeks, and hospice is involved. They're truly wonderful people, for anyone who is wondering. My brother is staying here with us full time, and his wife comes over daily. Basically a non stop stream of visitors which is good to keep her distracted. 

Honestly, I hope, when it happens, that she just falls asleep. Please, no seizures, no coma, nothing too painful. Just sleep.

_________

January 30, didn't know my 54 year old mom has cancer. Definitely had some health problems, but after a lifetime of poor choices that's to be expected.

January 31, find out she has a large, stage IV, malignant adenocarcinoma in her right lung that has metastasized to her spinal fluid and meninges. I didn't even know leptomeningeal carcinoma was a thing. Super rare, aggressive, terminal. What the everlasting fuck.

I quit my career and moved from a place, man, and life that I love back to a place I moved away from for a reason to stay with her. No one asked me to, but neither did anyone tell me not to in any way, shape, or form.

This shit sucks. In just over a month she has lost almost all control of her legs. She has a facial palsy and food tastes different. Her ribs are now alternating between excruciating pain and tingling numbness. She has lost 20 lbs and hardly puts effort into eating, drinking, or moving regularly even though she knows those things will help. She hollers in pain most mornings until the pain meds kick in and she can get comfortable.

I want to help her. I want her to maintain her dignity and independence for what little time remains to her. But this is fucking hard. I listen to her holler but can't help. I've had to carry her and scoop her up off of the floor twice now. I'm constantly pushing food and liquids and meds, but usually I'm just ignored. 

AND I MISS MY FUCKING LIFE.

I'm watching my mom die. And it sucks. And I think I need more help with this, but my brother never has time because kids and her friends are unreliable and, to be honest, I'm terrible at asking for help.

80,If your loved one was recently diagnosed or you are struggling with coping- Lessons I have learned to survive the past 2 1/2 years.,"A little background:

My father, who has been the most influential person in my life, was diagnosed with stage 4 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer in the liver) on May 20th, 2015. He was 62.
The average prognosis for his stage was 6 months. We have been unbelievably lucky to still have my father with us, although we know the end can come at anytime.
I’m an only child and my parents have been married for 44 years. The three of us have been each other’s primarily support structure.
10 years ago, I never thought I could have survived this long without going crazy between the grief and the unknowns indefinitely. 
I realized that was not an option. There is no one size fits all solution, but hopefully some of the ways I have learned to deal with it will help someone else. (Also, I work in the medical field which has had some influence on what I have been able to help with.)

This is the mindset I maintain on good/ regular days (forget bad days, it all goes out the window):

1. I refuse to accept any type of specified timeframe for prognosis- which I am glad I did because he beat that timeframe multiple times over. It’s not that I am unrealistic, but life is unpredictable and I see it as not being over until it’s over. I promised my dad when he was diagnosed that I would go to the ends of the earth to find treatment options as long as he wants to continue to fight and will continue to do so for as long as possible.

2. I try very hard to stay focused on today when I think about my dad. Other than doing the research to make sure I always have a plan b option in the back of my mind for him, I try to look at it as today he is alive and when I am with him I stay focused on that moment.

3. I tell myself that I will have all the time in the world to grieve once that final day comes but until then, I am going to be rock strong for him, celebrate any positive news (a day with more energy, a better lab result, anything), and try to put a positive spin on something when he is having a rough day emotionally while still validating his feelings- it’s his right to feel however he feels, but if I can find anything that might make it seem a little less bleak, I will throw it out there.

4. I never question why. I keep it very simple and just accept that it is what it is, I don’t know why, and if I started to question why I would become angry at the injustice of it.

5. When I feel myself becoming overwhelmed with my emotions consistently without a break, I try to take a break when it’s possible. For me, that is usually having a day completely alone to clear my head, do nothing, and try to recenter myself and my perspective. I get out my emotions and I journal my thoughts into my phone. For myself, being an only child and not having anyone else in a similar situation thus far, I have used journaling as my way of getting it out. My mom and I talk about different stuff at times, but I don’t put any of my grief on her- she has more than enough on her plate.

6. I do my best to avoid feeling guilty in any way about anything with my dad. I know he knows how much I love him and that I am there for anything he needs whether he asks or not. This allows me to know that after each visit, if it’s the last time I ever see him, I am going to be okay with our ending.

7. When he was diagnosed I created a bucket list of things I wanted to say or do for him during the time we have left. One by one I have checked those things off my list.

My heart breaks for anyone who is diagnosed or has a loved one diagnosed with cancer. It’s a journey that can’t be imagined unless you actually experience it.",5.0,"['loved', 'number', 'recently', 'diagnosed', 'struggling', 'coping', 'lesfamrels', 'learned', 'survive', 'past', 'digit',

81,My husband died a month ago today,"My heart is so broken and I’m trying to think he’s in a “better place”. He didn’t want to die and he held on this last year with unbelievable pain and agony. I know he wants to be here with me and I’m afraid his soul is restless and he can’t let go to the next place.  I want to hear from him with some kind of sign that he’s ok
I believe in God and the hereafter and I’m so hurt all I do is cry. I know other people have gone through much worse than this but I know my life will never be the same.  Steve was in and off chemo for 8 long yrs. He had pneumonia and sepsis several times and non-alcoholic cirrhosis. His cancer was colorectal and it metastasized to his bone, lungs and kidneys. He hemorrhaged 3 times and the Drs. said he was a miracle. And now my miracle is gone and I have this huge void in my life. I have so many regrets and guilt. 
I did the best I could for him.

82,My sister is my person,"My sister has been battling breast cancer for almost 2 years now. We started at a smaller hospital that initially diagnosed her with stage 3 triple negative breast cancer. They told us it was aggressive but they’d cure it. After rounds of chemo, then a mastectomy, then radiation, the cancer metastasized to her brain. We were now at stage 4. 

We switched to a more renowned hospital. More chemo. More radiation. Gamma knife. All of it. We had zero doubts in our mind, as rough as the road got, she’d be a breast cancer survivor. She’d be one of the 22% of women and men who survive stage 4 breast cancer. 

Monday, the doctor told us the the cancer had spread beyond the liver, the bones, the brain and wherever else it had spread to in the past 2 years, to the spinal and brain fluid. 

Leptomeningeal metastasis. Whatever the hell that is. Before this, her oncologist had lots of different options for us. But this.....this is it. The doctor who had kept our hope alive told us that it’s time to transition to hospice. Once diagnosed, you basically have 4-6 weeks to live. It is only seen in 3-5% of all cancer cases and it happened to our survivor. 

My sister is the smartest person I’ve ever known. She had just finished year 1 at a top 10 law school on a full ride scholarship when she was diagnosed. I remember the pride (and slight disappointment lol) I felt when she said Duke Law accepted her and offered her money but that wasn’t the school for her. I remember the pride I felt when after months of chemo treatments, she went to interview with some of the best firms in the world for a summer internship. I celebrated her wins and callbacks with her. I scoffed at the firms that just weren’t good enough with her. 

She graduated top of her class in undergrad. She would mostly likely be a lawyer for a top firm or somebody incredibly important......now she can’t tell me where she is. She confuses basic words or makes up new words. She can’t get her thoughts across. She’s in a state of delirium (another new word for me). 

My sister is my hero. I try so hard not to cry when I play along with her hallucinations. I can’t help myself from crying when I see my parents who were so incredibly proud of my sister and all of her accomplishments watch their child’s life come to an end in the most painful way possible. 

When she’s lucid, she tells me how scared she is and how she’s not ready to give up fighting. We were supposed to live long, successful lives. There is no more fight. I’ve spent hours looking up clinical trials. There are 11 recruiting right now for leptomeningeal mets and most of them exclude her for one reason or another. 

Whether anyone reads this or not, I just needed to get my thoughts out there. I talk to no one about this. Most people in my life have no idea what’s going on except for family. I don’t know how I’m going to listen to people talk about their siblings when I’m losing mine. How parents can talk about their children knowing my parents watched theirs deteriorate in the worst way. 

My sister is my person. I don’t know what’s next and I’m too scared to find out.",4.0,"['famrel', 'perfamrel', 'famrel', 'has', 'been', 'battling', 'breast', 'cancer', 'digit', 'years', 'now', 'started', 'smaller',

84,Not sure what / how I’m feeling,"My mother (52) was diagnosed with grade iv glioblastoma in August of 2016. She’s made an incredible run, and unfortunately she is in her last days at home. While I’m happy that she’s living out her final wishes, I’m confused. She has been bed bound for over a month now, and completely unresponsive for over a week, yet she still holds on because of how young she is. I’m only 21. 
 
I insist on going to work at nights rather than being home. At work I’m happy and joking, and I even use rather dark humor about my situation to cope and it gets a laugh out of my friends and coworkers including me. I’m worried I’m acting too nonchalant, but I’m trying to support my father and younger brother. 

This past Friday we told my younger brother what was going on, and he was devastated which is obviously expected. My father has also been doing his best to keep it together for his family, but I feel as if I’ve stepped up and taken his place in terms of emotional support. I feel terrible for what my father and brother are feeling, but I don’t think I am feeling the same way even though my mother and I are close as all hell. I’m the one telling them it’s going to be ok, I’m still going out with my brother to distract him (and I’ll occasionally go out with friends) and trying to go to the gym, I’m still doing volunteer work on the side, but I don’t feel like it’s impacting me as much as it should. Is this normal? I’m not too sad lately, I’m incredibly upbeat and honestly I’m treating my mother and the family as if she’s one of my patients. I’m just very matter of fact while also trying to keep a smile and work with the family. Is this normal? 

I guess I also don’t like when people say I’m handling it very well.

Yesterday, my SO was rushed to the hospital for a series of seizures. When he arrived at the hospital, he went into cardiac arrest and was revived but he went into a coma.

His mom is with him thankfully, and now they're going to do a test to check if there is still brain activity

There's so much sadness that I don't really know how to process right now. He's only 23. He should've had his whole life ahead of him. It makes me so sad, but also just as angry! Why did it have to be him?!

90,Doing Better,"Hey guys,

A few months ago I posted about being diagnosed with stage iv colon cancer. No family history or genetic mutations-guess I just got unlucky. I’m only 21, and so my life pretty much collapsed around me. 

Still, I wanted to share that I’ve been doing so well. I was able to graduate and land a position at my favorite museum (I’m going to brag and say that it’s a prestigious museum, hehe). I studied anthropology in case anyone was wondering!

I haven’t posted since my diagnosis, but I want to let you know that I would read all of your posts religiously, and I cried with you, empathized with you, and celebrated with you. 

So even though I haven’t been super active, I feel close enough to you all that I want to share some other news that’s made me really happy. My initial CEA(tumor marker) levels were at 4000; they have gone down to 26! I know that they’re still high, but it still feels like an accomplishment :)

I still have three rounds of chemo left, and apart from losing my hair, I’ve been so fortunate to have had a great quality of life thus far. 

I guess I just want to say thank you to all of you- this subreddit has made a world of a difference to me",1.0,"['doing', 'better', 'hey', 'guys', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'posted', 'about', 'being', 'diagnosed', 'stage', 'iv', 'colon', 'cancer', 'no', 'family', 'history', 'genetic', 'mutationsguess', 'just', 'got', 'unlucky', 'I am', 'only', 'digit', 'so', 'life', 'pretty', 'much', 'collapsed', 'around', 'wanted', 'share', 'I have', 'been', 'doing', 'so', 'well', 'able', 'graduate', 'land', 'position', 'favorite', 'museum', 'I am', 'going', 'brag', 'say', 'it is', 'prestigious', 'museum', 'hehe', 'studied', 'anthropology', 'case', 'anynumber', 'wondering', 'have not', 'posted', 'since', 'diagnosis', 'want', 'let', 'know', 'would', 'read', 'all', 'posts', 'religiously', 'cried', 'empathized', 'celebrated', 'so', 'even', 'though', 'have not', 'been', 'super', 'active', 'feel', 'close', 'enough', 'all', 'want', 'share', 'some', 'other', 'news', 'that is', 'made', 'happy', 'initial', 'ceatumor', 'marker', 'levels', 'digit', 'gnumber', 'down', 'digit', 'know', 'they are', 'high', 'feels', 'like', 'accomplishment', 'number', 'rounds', 'chemo', 'left', 'apart', 'losing', 'hair', 'I have', 'been', 'so', 'fortunate', 'had', 'great', 'quality', 'life', 'thus', 'far', 'guess', 'just', 'want', 'say', 'thank', 'all', 'subreddit', 'has', 'made', 'world', 'difference']",doing better hey guys few months ago posted about being diagnosed stage iv colon cancer no family history genetic mutationsguess just got unlucky I am only digit so life pretty much collapsed around wanted share I have been doing so well able graduate land position favorite museum I am going brag say it is prestigious museum hehe studied anthropology case anynumber wondering have not posted since diagnosis want let know would read all posts religiously cried empathized celebrated so even though have not been super active feel close enough all want share some other news that is made happy initial ceatumor marker levels digit gnumber down digit know they are high feels like accomplishment number rounds chemo left apart losing hair I have been so fortunate had great quality life thus far guess just want say thank all subreddit has made world difference
91,Super anxious waiting on test results,"So I guess a little back story:

Almost exactly a year ago my boyfriend (age 27 at the time) was diagnosed with stage 3 testicular cancer (seminoma). He had a huge mass in his stomach, along with a mass in the lymph nodes in his neck, and lesions on his lungs. He went through chemo for 9 weeks. Everything went great and he was in remission. But, They had to delay his testicle removal surgery due to a blood clot. 

During the delay on the surgery I started noticing old symptoms coming back. After more scans, his oncologist said that not only was the cancer back, but it had spread to a spot on his spine. Surgery was finally scheduled, and then more chemo was scheduled to follow shortly after. 

He finished his VeIP chemo about a month ago now. His tumor markers have appeared fine and he appears to be the best he has in six months. We find out on Tuesday whether everything is good or whether he needs the stem cell transplant. I am worried sick. So anxious all the time. I feel like our world is finally going back to normal again and it could easily flip upside down in a few days. 

I am only 23 and have been there for him as much as I could be. I would go from work to school to the hospital to sleep in a shitty chair five nights a weeks during his last chemo. I would do all the cooking and all the cleaning at our apt when we were finally out of the hospital. I feel like I was becoming so drained this last time around that I can’t imagine how I would be for the next treatment. Especially since it would be 3 weeks in the hospital at a time. 

I would be there 24/7 for him if I could, but it’s just not realistic with work and school. 

I guess I don’t really have a point to this post other than needing to vent because my mind has been racing all night. It just sucks so much.

96,Should I quit my job?,"Hi guys. 

In early July, my mother was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer in a pretty advanced stage (effected lymph nodes in distant regions like neck and lower stomach region). From never having any previous symptoms or serious health issues outside of a blood clot, she’s now being told that her anticipated life expectancy is around the 10 month mark. Our 2nd opinion oncologist that we visited today has said that her type of cancer has a best-case scenario survival rate of 2.5 to 3 years. 

My question to you, the experienced, is how do you organise your life around it? I’m 22, the middle child & we have a very close mother-daughter bond. I’ve taken every required day off work to get her to all of her appointments and to be with her throughout all medical developments. But, with the most consistent message being that she may die soon, I’m worried that a few days off here and there will not be enough.

I work full time in an admin job that is definitely not my end goal; I got it fresh out of uni so that I could be paid whilst looking for degree-relative work. My boss has been super understanding & flexible with me, but now I’m genuinely contemplating leaving.

For this, I defer to you guys. I’m very new to the process of living with cancer so close in my family, and it’s been such an emotionally blinding roller coaster. I don’t know what to do or where to go from here, and I’m hoping you guys have some experience in dealing with your workplace demands while having someone you love battle this dreadful disease.",7.0,"['should', 'quit', 'job', 'guys', 'early', 'month', 'famrel', 'diagnosed', 'oesophageal', 'cancer', 'pretty', 'advanced', 'stage', 'effected', 'lymph', 'nodes', 'distant', 'regions', 'like', 'neck', 'lower', 'stomach', 'region', 'never', 'having', 'any', 'previous', 'symptoms', 'serious', 'health', 'issues', 'outside', 'blood', 'clot', 'she is', 'now', 'being', 'anticipated', 'life', 'expectancy', 'around', 'digit', 'month', 'mark', 'digitnd', 'opinion', 'oncologist', 'visited', 'today', 'has', 'said', 'type', 'cancer', 'has', 'bestcase', 'scenario', 'survival', 'rate', 'digit', 'digit', 'years', 'question', 'experienced', 'how', 'do', 'organise', 'life', 'around', 'I am', 'digit', 'middle', 'child', 'close', 'famrelfamrel', 'bond', 'I have', 'taken', 'every', 'required', 'day', 'off', 'work', 'get', 'all', 'appointments', 'throughout', 'all', 'medical', 'developments', 'most', 'consisnumbert', 'message', 'being', 'month', 'die', 'soon', 'I am', 'worried', 'few', 'days', 'off', 'here', 'there', 'will', 'not', 'enough', 'work', 'full', 'time', 'admin', 'job', 'definitely', 'not', 'end', 'goal', 'got', 'fresh', 'out', 'uni', 'so', 'could', 'paid', 'whilst', 'looking', 'degreerelative', 'work', 'boss', 'has', 'been', 'super', 'understanding', 'flexible', 'now', 'I am', 'genuinely', 'contemplating', 'leaving', 'defer', 'guys', 'I am', 'new', 'process', 'living', 'cancer', 'so', 'close', 'family', 'it is', 'been', 'such', 'emotionally', 'blinding', 'roller', 'coaster', 'do not', 'know', 'do', 'where', 'here', 'I am', 'hoping', 'guys', 'some', 'experience', 'dealing', 'workplace', 'demands', 'while', 'having', 'somenumber', 'love', 'battle', 'dreadful', 'disease']",should quit job guys early month famrel diagnosed oesophageal cancer pretty advanced stage effected lymph nodes distant regions like neck lower stomach region never having any previous symptoms serious health issues outside blood clot she is now being anticipated life expectancy around digit month mark digitnd opinion oncologist visited today has said type cancer has bestcase scenario survival rate digit digit years question experienced how do organise life around I am digit middle child close famrelfamrel bond I have taken every required day off work get all appointments throughout all medical developments most consisnumbert message being month die soon I am worried few days off here there will not enough work full time admin job definitely not end goal got fresh out uni so could paid whilst looking degreerelative work boss has been super understanding flexible now I am genuinely contemplating leaving defer guys I am new process living cancer so close family it is been such emotionally blinding roller coaster do not know do where here I am hoping guys some experience dealing workplace demands while having somenumber love battle dreadful disease

98,My mom's first appointment,"Last week my mom went to the doctor for a persistent cough.  She has smoked for at least as long as my sister and I have been alive.  At least 40 years.  They found spots on her lungs and one on her kidney.  They said the spot on the kidney may be a cyst, which apparently is not uncommon.  She also has a lump on her lower back.  According to the internet, that's not a good sign when it comes along with a spot on your kidney.   My son had issues when he was born and I learned two things.  1.  Stay off the internet.  2. Don't worry until you have something to worry about.  I am trying to remember those two things.

Today we have out first consultation to find out what all these spots are and what will happen going forward.

99,How do you cope with a loved one that is terminal,"Hi all,

First post so please excuse me if I'm out of line. My father was diagnosed with bladder cancer last year. To paint a picture, I was in Italy last October, just proposed to my girlfriend and called my folks to let them know ow the good news. I was met with a rather flat tone, and on face time I knew something was up. They didn't want to say anything when I tried pushing it and said to ask when I got home. Soon as I touched down back in AUS a week later I asked, and that's when they told me. My dad had actually found out weeks prior but they didn't want to ruin mine and my fiance's trip. 

Fast forward 6 months, and he has managed to beat the bladder cancer,. Ur w strange growth has appeared I his leg. Within 2 weeks this growh is not over 8"" in eize. The doctors then tell us that his cancer from the bladder has spread and is metasratic. This absolutely crushes our family, as we had high hopes of my dad over coming this. 

After receiving this news, my fiance's dad is diagnosed with colon cancer in the same week.

I've been trying to.be strong for my family for so long now, and my partners family, but I now feel like it's eating me up inside. 

We just celetebrwted what may be my dad's last Christmas. He is only 64. He gave my mum a gift of a bear that has pre.recored messages. The message he left was that of someone that had come to terms with the fact that when they listen to the message, they know that person is gone.


I'm really struggling now to come to terms with what has been dealt to our family. My father has been there mostotal individual k have ever known, yet he has been dealt the absolute worst cards in life.

He did not go peacefully. I was not there. I feel guilty. 


The only moment I really cried was when he was already dead. I was afraid to touch him, but I did it anyway. The panic and pain came over me like a wave. I started hyperventilating, and almost passed out. 


During the funeral I was only comforting my mother. She leans heavily on me for support. No one else sat beside her or comforted her. I had to do it alone. He already had children, and their partners, we are close with, whom could have sat around her with me.

This is particularly messed up for me because as I kid I had to take care of her. She was depressed and I was her caregiver.

103,Mum’s mental problems escalating w caregiver stress,"
TLDR; my dad’s long-standing terminal illness has deeply affected family dynamics and exacerbated mental health issues among caregivers, it’s come to a boiling point where caregivers are impaired when we are needed the most  - help !! 

—

My dad’s lived with cancer since I was 9; I am now 29. Over the past couple of years the cancer has metastasised and was kept under control with chemo, but now we are in the final phase with one last treatment that will give him a couple of months. That treatment has been paused due to a very major abdominal surgery and pneumonia in the past couple of months; he has been in and out of hospital three times in the last three to four weeks. It’s been insane to say the least. At one point during the abdominal surgery we thought that was goodbye.

Me and my Sister share caregiving duties with my mum, who is accustomed to being his primary caregiver since we were children. In times of extreme stress (when my dad is manifestly ill), my mum shows signs of extreme burnout — obsessive compulsive behaviour, severe mood swings, irritability, feeling criticised all the time. As much as I try to take the load off of her and give her time to recuperate, she insists on doing caregiving duties, sometimes in excess and to little effectiveness. This morning she forgot to give my dad his medication (it was only an hour late), but it seemed to trigger a spiral of controlling behaviour. 

My Sister recently developed a fear of choking and swallowing that I surmise has stemmed from the intense stress and anxiety of this time. In the past couple of weeks she has had to slowly eat one long meal a day composed of very soft foods. She’s even had to supplement her diet with the nutritional drinks my dad is supposed to take. We have gotten her throat checked out (fine) and arranged for psych and Counselling services. She however, seems to lack initiative, and drags her feet on calling numbers and even taking her medication (she recently developed an upper respiratory tract infection). 

My mum is spiralling because now both my Sister and my dad are ill - my dad with his terminal illness and pneumonia complication, my sis with her anxiety and it’s manifestation, as well as her recent infection. She reacts to this by being intrusive and controlling, berating my Sister, becomes reactive to the sound of her coughing in her room, emotionally dumping on me all the time (even when I draw a line - she doesn’t hear it / she can only hear the din of her chaotic emotions), randomly and dramatically doing things like fishing out a weighing scale and asking me if it’s a good thing to get my Sister to see her weight right now (as though it will “scare her” into doing... what exactly? Eating more? She’s already improving in her intake...) just last night things got so bad I had to pass her a counselling emergency helpline to call. It seemed to calm her down. This morning it’s like the conversation never happened and she began doing all those things again. I’m not sure exactly what brought it on other than a sense of lack of control when she forgot my farher’s medication — it’s like her world sifts dramatically all the time. I suspect my mum has had undiagnosed and untreated mental health issues on top of her caregiver stress, and the combination is not pretty. It actually makes recovery and healing at home very disruptive and disorganised. Before my dad’s most recent prognosis, this tended to be the dynamic in the family too. Home was a contradictory mix of safety, imagination, love, high emotionality, outbursts, stress, intrusive behaviour and poor boundaries. In the past this has escalated into some very bad periods, including a time when my mum pressured my sister to give up a place as a very prestigious university when she showed adjustment issues, to study locally instead; it seemed that she did that to “resolve” the “problem” and minimise the stress in her vicinity. Growing up, this lead me to engage in pleasing behaviours and complete tearaway behaviour when I wanted to get away from feeling engulfed by the family (it also resulted in feeling extreme guilt in not spending more time with my dad, which comes and goes).

I’m trying my best to arrange schedules, deal with my dad and sis in a calmer, more persuasive way. I’ve been seeing a counsellor since July as I realised I needed help during this time. This counsellor made me much more aware of some of the consequences of the highly involved / poor boundary dynamic my family has. My mum doesn’t seem to realise that one of the main things she has to deal with at the moment is her mental health. Some advice will be appreciated. At the moment I do not know what to do besides taking over caregiving duties myself and getting a nurse to do home visits to help. However, my mum’s mental instability, and the legacy of that in my family (in me and my Sister) still remains an issue. Thanks a lot.

104,Chemo fog is finally starting to lift and I’m having some revelations,"Thought I would post to see if anyone else could relate. This is basically one long vent. 

I know a lot of cancer “survivors”—it’s a cringe term *to me*—have stated that they hate being told they’re brave. Or that they’re so strong. Or that they’re a fighter. I know this isn’t a unique thought of my own. I just hate when friends leave comments on social media saying those things, or when my sister posts a photo of us, and I happen to be bald, the whole comment section turns into tagging me and saying how beautiful I am and I have such a nice shaped head for chemo. Thanks? 

I couldn’t figure out why it pissed me off so much to see those comments. And then I realized today when I posted a collage showing hair growth what upset me. I thought how fast my hair suddenly started growing was interesting, and there are a lot of people I know who haven’t seen me in a while, so I thought I’d update. I regret it now. My whole comment section is full of the same thing: you’re so brave, you’re so positive!, way to look at things positively in such a scary fight!, etc etc. Just a million ways of saying the same thing, and all of it saying nothing. 

I just went to show my sister the ONE funny comment a high school friend left on the post, and I told her the rest of the comments pissed me off. 

I don’t feel brave now and I didn’t during chemo. I didn’t feel like I was battling anything. I didn’t feel like I had the heart of a lion, full of courage. I didn’t feel strong. I was at the weakest I have ever been during chemo. And I’m still pretty weak. I have to ask people to help me open jars now and lift boxes at work. I’m the youngest in my department and now I have to ask everyone else to grab heavy equipment for me. 

I **was** a strong and independent woman before chemo. I still feel that deep down, in character I guess, but physically, I am weak and dependent. In all honesty, going through chemo wasn’t brave. __*I felt like a rat. A lab rat that was trapped, and the only way out was to let the doctors experiment on me.*__ That’s not noble or courageous. That’s just allowing things to happen to you. What was my other choice? Literally: just hope that the cancer wouldn’t come back. And surprise! I’m still there now, 3 months out of chemo. Hoping and praying that the cancer doesn’t show up in my lungs or brain. 

What bravery is there when I cry into my pillow, asking God to just take away the pain, the anxiety, to lift the chemo fog? What battle am I fighting when I agreed to have these chemicals put in my body and I’m crumpled on my bed, screaming and begging for the bone pains to go away?

105,Bladder Cancer,"Lost my mother to bladder cancer over 20 years ago, and now my brother has been fighting the same type for a couple years now. He just recently had his bladder, prostate and one kidney removed after Keytruda failed, and we hoped that they got it all. Fast forward to today; the doctor went over his pathology results and it wasn’t good. The doc basically told us to prepare because if this chemo trial doesn’t work he’s looking at maybe a year and change. I feel so guilty because I don’t know how to support him through this without falling apart. He is the only family I have left. I am angry and I am barely holding on, but to think of what he is going through makes the guilt even greater.

106,2020 needs to cut it out with the bad news,"Hey all, so my mother had small cell carcinoma last year out of the blue and her chances weren't great at the time due to her also having numerous auto immune conditions throughout her body. We went ahead with both multiple rounds of chemo and radiation therapy and miraculously someone saw an almost completely decline or removal of all cancerous tissue in three months. We thought we got out lucky but five months later three more lumps have appeared and the chances of them being cancerous are high. We believe it was due to the radiation therapy.

107,Moving Forward,"My fiancé died December 14th at approximately 4:10 PM. He left behind the most beautiful sunset that I have ever and will ever have seen. I haven't had the courage to write about it until now because I'm positive that there are absolutely NO words to describe what I (and many others) have gone through the past few weeks. I've witnessed his last few, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds... I hear the rasping of his last breaths in my waking moments and dreams. I am eternally thankful that I was there to hold his hand until the end. I pray that he heard me tell him it is okay. That we (his family and I) are with him forever no matter where he goes. 

After he died, it was like a black comedy. His mother arrived and so did his younger brother, his two sisters in law, to talk to his still corpse. We all acted like it was okay (or as okay as it could be) and joked as much as we could while his body was still in the room (it took quite a while for someone ((the assigned nurse from hospice)) to pronounce him deceased). When the funeral people came, however, it was quite a different story. 

I was told by my fiance's older brother to not witness his body being lifted onto the stretcher and taken away because (bless these people) they would handle him as a body, as a job, which is not what I would have wanted to see at that time. So I listened and I spoke with the older brother's wife while I heard my finance's body being transferred and then carried out. I regret to his day that I didn't follow him but I'm not sure that I would have survived as I have if I had done so. 

His funeral services and reception were done that next Monday. His mother and father paid for everything with only the closest friends and family invited at the discretion of his family. His younger brother was responsible for the eulogy which had been cut down to 2 minutes during the formal ceremony and extended to 8 during the informal reception. We all smiled, laughed and cried in that order. 

Afterwards I moved from California to my hometown. My closest friends and family helped me pack and move my belongings in almost an entire day. I'm moving into an apartment within the next 7 days and I'll be reentering my previous job in the next 30 days. It's weird thinking that i'll be returning to how I was almost a year ago but without him. 

Every day I miss him. I miss the way he would slip from his work shoes into his sandals then head straight to the grill. The way he would sigh and then hug me close after a hard day at work. The way he would slip a hand around my shoulders and mutter something hilariously funny while he stoked the coals.

Even more, I miss the way that he would smile with his green-brown eyes and watch Jeopardy whenever it was on or force me to exit my social comfort zone to edge a little closer to his but, without that exuberance, I wouldn't have the support system I have now.

108,I’m 25 years old and I’m about to lose my mom,"For the past 2 years I’ve watched my mom suffer from cancer. Started in her breasts then spread to lymph nodes, lungs, and bones. She’s gone through so much. Multiple major surgeries, rounds of chemo, radiation, and hospital visits. On Christmas Eve she was hospitalized in the palliative unit and will be transferred to hospice in a few days. The doctor thinks she only has a few more weeks left.

It’s so hard seeing her in such immense pain. I feel like I’m watching my mom die a slow and painful death. She has bags of morphine attached to her but her pain level is still at a 7. She has on and off fevers so she’s hot, sweating, and extremely uncomfortable from the pain. I keep asking the doctor to up the morphine dosage, which he does, but she is still hurting so much. I wish there was something that could numb her body completely so she can be comfortable and enjoy her last few weeks of life. 

I feel completely broken. My mom loves life so much and is not ready to give up even though her body is shutting down. She has asked the doctor to resuscitate her if she goes into cardiac arrest. She forces herself to eat little bites of food because she knows she needs food in her system. I wish I can tell her it’s okay to let go, but she is so hopeful I don’t want to ruin that.

My mom is the strongest, bravest, most beautiful and loving person I know. She’s my rock and my favourite person. I don’t know how I’m going to live without her, but I’m the luckiest person in the world to be given her as my mom, and that 25 years of my life will have been with her.",6.0,"['I am', 'digit', 'years', 'old', 'I am', 'about', 'lose', 'mom', 'past', 'digit', 'years', 'I have', 'watched', 'mom', 'suffer', 'cancer', 'started', 'breasts', 'spread', 'lymph', 'nodes', 'lungs', 'bnumbers', 'she is', 'gnumber', 'through', 'so', 'much', 'multiple', 'major', 'surgeries', 'rounds', 'chemo', 'radiation', 'hospital', 'visits', 'on', 'christmas', 'eve', 'hospitalized', 'palliative', 'unit', 'will', 'transferred', 'hospice', 'few', 'days', 'doctor', 'thinks', 'only', 'has', 'few', 'more', 'weeks', 'left', 'it is', 'so', 'hard', 'seeing', 'such', 'immense', 'pain', 'feel', 'like', 'I am', 'watching', 'mom', 'die', 'slow', 'painful', 'death', 'has', 'bags', 'morphine', 'attached', 'pain', 'level', 'digit', 'has', 'on', 'off', 'fevers', 'so', 'she is', 'hot', 'sweating', 'extremely', 'uncomfortable', 'pain', 'keep', 'asking', 'doctor', 'up', 'morphine', 'dosage', 'does', 'hurting', 'so', 'much', 'wish', 'there', 'something', 'could', 'numb', 'body', 'completely', 'so', 'comfortable', 'enjoy', 'last', 'few', 'weeks', 'life', 'feel', 'completely', 'broken', 'mom', 'loves', 'life', 'so', 'much', 'not', 'ready', 'give', 'up', 'even', 'though', 'body', 'shutting', 'down', 'has', 'asked', 'doctor', 'resuscitate', 'goes', 'cardiac', 'arrest', 'forces', 'eat', 'little', 'bites', 'food', 'because', 'knows', 'needs', 'food', 'system', 'wish', 'tell', 'it is', 'okay', 'let', 'so', 'hopeful', 'do not', 'want', 'ruin', 'mom', 'strongest', 'bravest', 'most', 'beautiful', 'loving', 'perfamrel', 'know', 'she is', 'rock', 'favourite', 'perfamrel', 'do not', 'know', 'how', 'I am', 'going', 'live', 'without', 'I am', 'luckiest', 'perfamrel', 'world', 'given', 'mom', 'digit', 'years', 'life', 'will', 'been']",I am digit years old I am about lose mom past digit years I have watched mom suffer cancer started breasts spread lymph nodes lungs bnumbers she is gnumber through so much multiple major surgeries rounds chemo radiation hospital visits on christmas eve hospitalized palliative unit will transferred hospice few days doctor thinks only has few more weeks left it is so hard seeing such immense pain feel like I am watching mom die slow painful death has bags morphine attached pain level digit has on off fevers so she is hot sweating extremely uncomfortable pain keep asking doctor up morphine dosage does hurting so much wish there something could numb body completely so comfortable enjoy last few weeks life feel completely broken mom loves life so much not ready give up even though body shutting down has asked doctor resuscitate goes cardiac arrest forces eat little bites food because knows needs food system wish tell it is okay let so hopeful do not want ruin mom strongest bravest most beautiful loving perfamrel know she is rock favourite perfamrel do not know how I am going live without I am luckiest perfamrel world given mom digit years life will been

We just took his blood pressure again and it was 176/96 which still isn’t good. Is this blood pressure enough to take him to the hospital??

113,"19 month old diagnosed yesterday, need a place to be honest.","So I'm not really sure how to explain my thought process for wanting to post this other than to say I'm angry and scared. Part of this is that I come from a family and community of very faith focused people, while my wife and I fall into more of an agnostic belief system. Everyone I've told wants to make it a conversation about capital G god, and that is not cathartic for me in any way. 

Last week my son had a high fever and some lethargy, but was otherwise his normal 19 month old tornado of a person. Thursday I took him to a pediatrician for an abdominal inspection due to bloating, and was told he was gassy. Saturday while I was at a fantasy football draft my wife noticed a lump in his abdomen. She took him to urgent care, who referred us to the ER. Five hours later we are told we need to drive 8 hours to the children's hospital. 24 hours later we are being told that our baby boy has Hepatoblastoma. Currently his liver is massive, and the cancerous mass will not be able to be resected until he has completed several rounds of chemo. We are awaiting full biopsy results to determine a more specific diagnosis. We are being told nothing specific regarding stage or prognosis other than, ""most likely very treatable,"" which makes me angry. We have no hard data, which makes me angry. He has been an amazing, sweet, talkative, loving baby his whole life, and that being stolen from him makes me angry. 

More than anything I'm angry that there's nothing to blame. I am so scared, sad, and furious, and there's not a fucking thing we can do other than love him and try to be strong. I don't know what to do.

I have gained immense respect for all of the other people out there who have experienced this bullshit disease first hand or as parents. Fuck this stupid sickness. 

Vent over. If you made it this far thank you for allowing me some catharsis. I wish you luck in your personal battles, wherever you stand today.

114,Somebody Wake me up Please,"Cancer is nothing like what you see on Tv. Death on television is always portrayed with a bit of foreshadowing. You get this gut feeling that something is going to happen to your favorite character. 

In real life, death can be so unexpected. It catches you and your loved ones by surprise. My dad was just diagnosed with liver cancer. He has two large tumors which doctors say are inoperable. It feels like they’re trying to get us to consider Hospice. 

Just 3 months ago my dad was a healthy man. He was traveling and living life to the fullest. Then boom. Our world came crashing down. Everything went downhill so fast. 

I’m not ready to let go. He wants to, but I’m just not ready. I need my dad to see me graduate college, become a mother, and maybe a wife someday.

117,My wife’s “cancer buddy” died today.,"My wife is four months into chemo for Stage IV pancreatic cancer which was diagnosed over the summer. About a year or so before her diagnosis, a former coworker of hers that she’d reconnected with (albeit long distance) learned she also had Stage IV colon cancer, and after my wife was diagnosed, they bonded even closer. Her friend seemed to be well into remission, but we just learned that she succumbed this morning.

Not only is my wife mourning the loss of her friend, she’s also feeling like she’s lost a lot of the hope that she had placed in watching her friend appearing to beat the illness. I’m trying to console her the best I can, but it’s a huge blow to her.

123,Just had my 1st haircut 6 months post treatment!,"My treatment was especially intensive so after my first lot of chemo my hair was falling out by the handful not even 2 days after, so I decided the whole lot should just come off and went fully bald.

Fast forward to 2019 and my hair had grown back with the chemo curls and while I wasn't happy it was curly, I'm just glad I could grow my hair again.

 I wasn't especially excited at first but after getting out the chair and seeing my reflection in the mirror I felt a kind of joy I haven't had in a long time. As soon as he held up the mirror to show the back of my head a big smile came across my face. I'd always been especially fond of my hair so to see it come back curly and a mess was interesting for sure. But 6 months later and I'm finally starting to look like my old self again and it's truly amazing. You never realise how much you take for granted and how much the little things really help you.

127,I am so lonely,"I am dying.  I have been fighting this for three years but for the last year treatment has just been palliative.  Even when I'm not on chemo I feel myself fading slowly. And there is absolutely no one that I can talk to about it.  

I have been the cheerful cancer warrior all this time but I just can't keep it up.  When I am sad, or frustrated or anything less than merry sunshine my family avoids me.  I know that it isn't malicious, they just aren't coping.  But what it means is I get the silent treatment from my husband and kids when I'm unhappy.  And I have talked to him about this *repeatedly*, but only after I cheer up again because that's what it takes to get him to speak to me.  

My closest friend can be good for some dark humor but a few weeks ago when my husband was avoiding me I texted her and she said she didn't want to get caught in the middle of us.  The two of them were already texting about me but neither would speak to me.  So I've had to revise my expectations from ""best friend"" to ""mutual friend"". 

My extended family has distanced themself since the terminal diagnosis. 

I am depressed, obviously and understandably.  I am on an antidepressant for nerve pain and it helps a little.  Cannabis oil (legal stuff) has really become a crutch because it's the only thing that keeps me smiling (and relieves other symptoms).  Yes I have had therapy, for me personally in my situation it just made me feel worse.

So here I am, on a tropical Christmas holiday that will certainly be my last, with 6 genuinely miserable humans that I love more than anything and no access to the medication that makes life bearable.

129,It's nice to have something in common with other people,"I feel very alone, and only you guys truly understand. My mom was diagnosed in 2011 with a throat tumor and had two surgeries to remove it, I was 7. Then in 2015 she was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer when I was 11. She had to go through chemo and a few surgeries and within a year was back to normal, although on many cancer related drugs and her health and hair gone. She is truly the strongest woman I know. Unfortunately, eight months ago she was diagnosed with breast cancer again, stage 3 triple negative metastatic, which is an incurable cancer. I am 15, and taking it pretty hard. I began seeing a therapist who diagnosed me with Acute Stress Disorder (a precursor to PTSD) and I feel so stressed as she only has around 10 months left on average. I have 5 siblings who are also having issues, my sister developed an eating disorder and was diagnosed with anxiety and I know some others keep theirs on the dl. I don't have friends, and it's hard to help my bf understand how this is affecting me and why it's hard for me to get up or carry on a conversation. I'm not sleeping or eating and seeing my mom in pictures when she was healthy just sends me into a dark room with no doors.

130,Ignoring the reality of a terminal prognosis,"My mom has stage 4 metastatic cancer and is currently on a treatment plan that has about 1.5 - 2 year average survival rate. Although I know it may just be a coping mechanism, I get frustrated when my parents talk about future plans (retiring in 5 years, moving to a new city in a few years, etc.). My mom still hasn't even stopped working yet. I find it very frustrating because the chances of living for much longer than 2 years is pretty slim and it won't even be long before the disease progresses to a point of even more pain. Has anyone experienced something similar with their loved ones? Can I somehow convince them that they need to fully appreciate the time left NOW? Or am I wrong to snap them out of this delusion if perhaps they are finding comfort in it? I don't understand why they would want to continue living life as if everything is normal.

133,Cornea transplant is now failing.,"And they’ve have ordered him back to hourly drops every hour.  I’ve had to call in a PSW as I cannot do the drops and be sane.  We don’t have a lot of money and the four days I’ve called them in will cost close to $800.  

Also his eye surgeon took a look at his lower cheek sore (about .75in in diameter) and the corresponding hole in his mouth and noted that the remaining part of his cheek that is swollen and hard is going to open up soon.

I know I said I just wanted it to end yesterday, but this is not what I meant.  I just want his suffering  to end.  Instead I get a phone call at work with him crying that his transplant is failing and he doesn’t want a feeding tube.

134,Cancer has changed me in ways I never thought possible,"A little bit of background :

I was diagnosed a little over a year ago at age 19 with malignant melanoma. I didn’t take it as serious at first because it’s ""just skin cancer"", but boy did that change quick. I was initially diagnosed Stage 3C, then after the first treatment failed, it grew rapidly resulting in me needing a ten hour surgery that was very difficult to recover from. The surgery was successful in removing the cancer in the area they worked on, but I developed immense pain in my leg soon afterwards which turned out to be one of five bone mets spread across my body that lit up on a PET scan. This obviously put me into Stage IV since my primary was on the very top of my head. 

In a recent trip to the acute care at my cancer hospital, masses on my left adrenal gland, and possibly the right as well, were found. However, I wasn't even phased by the news. I've now learned that cancer will do what it wants, when it wants. It doesn't care who you are or what's happening in your life or how young you are. I've had, and still have, my ""why me?"" moments, but I've come to learn that being negative about my situation will do nothing good. Whatever will happen, will happen, and there's nothing I can do to fight the inevitable. 

I  understand now that this is something I will be more than likely fighting for a very long time. It could even be the end of me, but to dwell on that is no way I want to live my life. I'm often stuck in bed in pain or sick from some other bullshit side effect from treatment, but this stupid ugly disease has made me the most grateful I've ever been in my young life.

136,My mom was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer today,"She went to the ER about a month ago for an unrelated health issue where they performed a CT scan. The scan picked up lytic bone lesions in her pelvis and spine. The ER doc said it’s likely due to cancer that has spread to her bones from elsewhere in her body. For the past month, she’s had numerous tests done and today we finally received news that it’s stage IV breast cancer. I’m so confused as to how this can happen. My mom has always been on top of her health and her yearly mammogram she had done a few months ago showed nothing abnormal. The only reason they found it was due to the CT scan they did when she went to the ER for something else. I’m trying hard to be strong for her but I’m so scared.

137,"Day-to-day, it’s still hard","Hi all,

I know lots of y’all that post are just finding out some devastating news, and every post I read breaks my heart. What I want to talk about today though (or really just vent, I’m having a really hard day) is how even when you’re “used to it”, it’s the little things that are quietly just as painful, but there’s very little support out there when these things come up.

My mom has stage 4 lung cancer, and has been lucky enough to be doing well most days. She receives care at Red Rocks Cancer Center in Colorado and her doctor has a revolutionary radiation technique that has helped her last this long (she is on Medicaid, otherwise there is no way we could afford it). I am her sole provider and much of the time her sole support system as well. My sister, who is 9 years older, is mostly useless, and comes and goes and is a good daughter when she feels like it. I know I am very lucky she’s been able to get the treatment she has, as most do not have the additional years she’s been afforded once they hit stage 4.

The last couple days, she’s been hurting really bad and in particular, she’s in a lot of pain when she gets up and moves or when she breathes in deeply. Her concern is that she has pneumonia again, which happens a few times a year as a result of inflammation from the many inhalers she has. 

I got home from my 2nd job last night after a 17 hour day, exhausted, but my mom wasn’t doing well. At one point, I asked if she was about to go to sleep and she said “she was afraid to sleep”, so I stayed up too and watched some TV with her. Finally she felt ok to sleep so I did too. After a couple hours, I woke up to go to work and found myself watching my mom, who was still sleeping, to make sure she was still breathing.

These are the things that I find it hard to explain to others, because how could you possibly understand unless you also are very aware that it’s possible you could wake up, but your loved one might not? I feel useless in my ability to comfort her because I cannot even pretend to know how she feels. These smaller moments are more devastating to me than the big ones - the tests, the scans, the appointments, the hospital visits even. In those times, I know there are teams of medical professionals far better equipped to handle all of this than I am, and I know she’s in good hands. When it’s 1 in the morning and she’s telling me she’s scared to go to sleep, it’s just me, and I have no idea what to say or do.

Today is Friday 7/26. It's my mom's birthday. I'm currently making birthday pancakes (with rainbow jimmy sprinkles as per tradition in our house). But, I don't know what else to do. We may just sit around the house.

Dear Mr. Mauldin, Mr. Darrow, and Ms. Popp-Hellebuyck

My name is Heather Ross and my husband is Lt. Colonel Gary Ross. We are an active duty military family temporarily staying at the Residence Inn in Denver while my husband receives cancer treatment at the Colorado Blood Cancer Institute. When we got here and met with the Oncologist he said that we would be here for a minimum of 6 months or longer; pending the outcome of his chemo treatment. So naturally we wanted to get Gary a comfortable La-Z-Boy recliner to provide comfort to him while he recovers from his surgery and upcoming treatments. When we arrived at your store #216 (with our service dog Lucy in tow) we met your associate, Kate and she knew exactly what we wanted. The prices were so good, we ended up purchasing TWO of your recliners!

We explained to Kate that Gary would be having surgery early Wednesday morning (Sept 5th) and that’s why we would like to have the chairs in place prior to that procedure. She said she couldn’t make any promises but would see what she could do.

Tuesday afternoon Kate called and said that due to the Labor Day holiday she couldn’t get a driver to deliver until Wednesday. We explained that we wouldn’t be home all day on Wednesday because of Gary’s surgery but that evening would be okay. She asked if she could call us back after looking at the schedule. We said absolutely and then never heard back from her.

We were sitting in our hotel room having dinner when there was a knock at the door. There standing with recliner #1 was Kate. She had a huge smile on her face and she said that she was delivering our two recliners. We stood there in shock as she rolled the recliner right into the room, put it all together and explained how it worked. My husband is very limited in moving items but we offered to help and she said absolutely not. She went downstairs and in a few minutes she was back at the door with recliner #2.

Again, she rolled it right in and set it up for us. I couldn’t fully express my gratitude because I didn’t want to start “ugly” crying. Cause let’s be honest, once the “ugly” cry happens it’s a hot mess for a solid two hours.

We were floored by Kate’s KINDNESS and her amazing CUSTOMER SERVICE. Amazing customer service and kindness are not often highlighted or appreciated as it should be. In a world of constant bickering and people being mean, when we have something GOOD happen it NEEDS to be celebrated and acknowledged. So please know as a caregiver, Kate is truly a hero and as a military spouse I don’t use that word lightly.

Thank you Kate and La-Z-Boy for allowing my husband the opportunity to come home from surgery and relax comfortably. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for making this incredibly difficult time a lot less stressful.

Customers for life and HUGE fans of Kate! 🙂

Gary and Heather Ross

141,Terminal wife upset with my need for self care. Advice appreciated.,"Back story: My wife has a terminal cancer diagnosis. Metastasized osteosarcoma and it’s been deemed inoperable, so we’re pursuing proton radiation with Mayo.

We married after her cancer diagnosis and we’re a blended family, both bringing a child into the relationship. I have a 7 year old daughter and she has a 6 year old son. She was a widow, so her son would have no biological surviving parent or other family in the state, so I’m going to legally adopt him. 

We’re 7 months into our cancer journey and it’s been far and away the most exhausting and crushing period of my life. More so than losing a parent or divorce.

Every doctor I’ve talked to, every book I’ve read, and every article I’ve clipped stresses the need for self care. That caregivers need to give themselves time outside of their lives, for them, specifically to refill your own cup. The problem is, with me holding down the household, there’s very little functional time and when I do try and advocate for it with my wife I’m met with hostility and hurt feelings. Insecurities that I’m trying to “get away” from her or hate our “cancer life”.

I realize that her emotions are more about cancer, losing herself, and dying, but it still sucks to not have any piece of my life for me. I wake up, make breakfast for the kids, get them to school, work, balance her needs and support her treatments, and try to ensure she gets as much as I can give her on an empty tank after they go to bed, but it’s still not enough for her.

I’m left in this lonely hellish existence, unable to even go to the gym or step away for a beer. Even if I go into my office to draw or something, I’m trying to “get away” from her. I feel so guilty, beaten down, and lonely, but I’m desperately trying to do my absolute best for her every single day.",7.0,"['terminal', 'famrel', 'upset', 'need', 'self', 'care', 'advice', 'appreciated', 'back', 'story', 'famrel', 'has', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'diagnosis', 'metastasized', 'osteosarcoma', 'it is', 'been', 'deemed', 'inoperable', 'so', 'we are', 'pursuing', 'proton', 'radiation', 'montho', 'married', 'after', 'cancer', 'diagnosis', 'we are', 'blended', 'family', 'both', 'bringing', 'child', 'relationship', 'digit', 'year', 'old', 'famrel', 'has', 'digit', 'year', 'old', 'famrel', 'widow', 'so', 'famrel', 'would', 'no', 'biological', 'surviving', 'parent', 'other', 'family', 'state', 'so', 'I am', 'going', 'legally', 'adopt', 'we are', 'digit', 'months', 'cancer', 'journey', 'it is', 'been', 'far', 'away', 'most', 'exhausting', 'crushing', 'period', 'life', 'more', 'so', 'than', 'losing', 'parent', 'divorce', 'every', 'doctor', 'I have', 'talked', 'every', 'book', 'I have', 'read', 'every', 'article', 'I have', 'clipped', 'stresses', 'need', 'self', 'care', 'caregivers', 'need', 'give', 'time', 'outside', 'lives', 'specifically', 'refill', 'own', 'cup', 'problem', 'holding', 'down', 'household', 'there is', 'little', 'functional', 'time', 'when', 'do', 'try', 'advocate', 'famrel', 'I am', 'met', 'hostility', 'hurt', 'feelings', 'insecurities', 'I am', 'trying', '“get', 'away”', 'hate', '“cancer', 'life”', 'realize', 'emotions', 'more', 'about', 'cancer', 'losing', 'dying', 'sucks', 'not', 'any', 'piece', 'life', 'wake', 'up', 'make', 'breakfast', 'kids', 'get', 'school', 'work', 'balance', 'needs', 'support', 'treatments', 'try', 'ensure', 'gets', 'much', 'give', 'on', 'empty', 'tank', 'after', 'bed', 'it is', 'not', 'enough', 'I am', 'left', 'lnumberly', 'hellish', 'exisnumberce', 'unable', 'even', 'gym', 'step', 'away', 'beer', 'even', 'office', 'draw', 'something', 'I am', 'trying', '“get', 'away”', 'feel', 'so', 'guilty', 'beanumber', 'down', 'lnumberly', 'I am', 'desperately', 'trying', 'do', 'absolute', 'best', 'every', 'single', 'day']",terminal famrel upset need self care advice appreciated back story famrel has terminal cancer diagnosis metastasized osteosarcoma it is been deemed inoperable so we are pursuing proton radiation montho married after cancer diagnosis we are blended family both bringing child relationship digit year old famrel has digit year old famrel widow so famrel would no biological surviving parent other family state so I am going legally adopt we are digit months cancer journey it is been far away most exhausting crushing period life more so than losing parent divorce every doctor I have talked every book I have read every article I have clipped stresses need self care caregivers need give time outside lives specifically refill own cup problem holding down household there is little functional time when do try advocate famrel I am met hostility hurt feelings insecurities I am trying “get away” hate “cancer life” realize emotions more about cancer losing dying sucks not any piece life wake up make breakfast kids get school work balance needs support treatments try ensure gets much give on empty tank after bed it is not enough I am left lnumberly hellish exisnumberce unable even gym step away beer even office draw something I am trying “get away” feel so guilty beanumber down lnumberly I am desperately trying do absolute best every single day
142,3 days after posting here my sister today died in front of my eyes,"My sister 3 hours ago died, she was laying and we got around her to help her to get to sleep when she started shushing someone to stop calling her.. after that she immediately started to throw up slowly and after small puke she just puked a red dark blood it was like coal dark.. and I knew first aid and I checked her pulse and called ambulance immediately where she died in my moms hands while I was holding her tight. 


I know this is strange but I can’t find anywhere what that dark blood means. Did her heart blew up? When ambulance came they did EKG, and the line is ——.. I don’t know what to say, everyone left the room and I hold her hand and talked to her and told her that I love her so much but nothing can’t change that she’s gone. But I’ll never let her out of my heart. She’s my sister, my blood.

143,Have my plan...,"I have neck cancer and will begin my treatment on December 30, with seven straight weeks of radiation, five days each week.  Also, incorporated in the radiation is one day of chemo.  The doctor gave me the best and worst case scenarios, non of which are fun.  The side effects are going to be horrible, but I have to push through for my wife and kids.  They are so encouraging.  I am also very lucky to have excellent medical care at city of  Hope in Duarte, CA.   They truly care about their patients.   

If wanybody had a few words of encouragement or perhaps has been through the treatment I =would to hear from you...if it is negative, horrible this is what happened to me, I’ll check that out on a different day.  Thank you not my Reddit family forgetting me this far.  Lastly, I am currently taking Percocet 10/325.  I am considering asking for morphine to get little bump from the pecoert as the pain killing is really hit and miss.  If I’m already getting the some relief, I figured what;s a little bump.

144,40 years since symptoms,"So today is my 40th anniversary since symptoms appeared.

In hindsight there were symptoms earlier, in July and August, but they passed and life went on. But for me, I awoke at about 7:15 on Oct 16 1980 and unable to move my legs and with a fever.

145,"My (M31) Dad (M60) was diagnosed with Stage 4 Melanoma approximately a year ago, and we live on opposite sides of the world. Having a hard time to cope with the distance.","Hi Everyone.

I apologize in advance for what might become quite the wall of text, for any mistakes (as English isn't my native language) and for the possible rambling.

I've put a **TLDR;** at the bottom as well, just in case this turns out a bit too confusion.

Just to give a bit of a background- My dad currently lives in the states (After emigrating in his mid 20's from the states to where I currently live, marrying twice, having me from the first marriage, divorcing and then 3 other kids from his 2nd marriage \[All pre to mid teens now\], and emigrating back to the states after living here for around 30 years), I was born & raised here and at the time of his return to the states (around 6 years ago) I've already built a life & a career for my self here which is why I stayed here.

After his diagnosis this past September, during which he was also diagnosed as pre-diabetic. My Fiancee( now wife) and I booked flights and visited him and the rest of the family for two weeks around December.

Up until that point he's had a biopsy for the initial diagnosis (Which was taken from his back), and right before our visit he had another biopsy to check his lymph nodes which sadly came back positive.

During our visit my dad was just starting his immunology treatments, and was working from home. Other than the fact he lost some weight (Due to his dietary changes to avoid his pre-diabetic state) he seemed in relatively good shape, even if he seemed a bit down emotionally speaking.

We spent our visit helping his wife with her business (She runs a boutique bakery from home), spent some quality time with my siblings and brought them all some much needed breathing room.

After returning from our visit we've tried to stay in touch as much as possible, plans were made and approved with the doctors to make sure the treatments were scheduled around our wedding (Which was held this June) so they all could come over and attend in between the treatments.

Then Covid hit here around Mid-March ,and with that the hopes of seeing them for the wedding.

Around April, after another routine check, the doctors did yet another biopsy and discovered that the tumor spread to his liver, and that apparently he has another simultaneous, non malignant cancer in his bladder, which is unrelated to melanoma.

Putting aside the fact the wedding planning was hard on us as it is due to the uncertainty brought by Covid,living with the fact my dad was going through immunology treatments which weren't really doing much and his deterioration felt like too much to handle.

Luckily, me and my SO managed to hold the wedding without too much trouble, with my dad and the rest of the family on conference call for the duration of the ceremony, which was quite bitter sweet for everyone involved.

I feel like this has already gotten quite rambly and long, but basically his Melanoma as of now has already spread past his initial tumor on his back, onto his lymph nodes, liver and now bones.

This past weekend I've received an update from his wife that he's had severe abdominal pains, and was rushed to the ER, his scans showed that his Liver is now twice its size, he's been on an induced coma since then to ease his suffering and perform any required tests to try and stabilize his condition.

Up until Covid hit, I've managed to draw inspiration from a lot of sources, here included, from people dealing with sick parents both close to them and overseas, but I feel that because of the pandemic the situation has just gotten much more difficult for me to handle mentally, mostly because I'm helpless and can't do anything.

I'm very lucky to have my SO and my close friends to be here for me and support me, but this situation feels so extreme because of the distance and the pandemic and I am honestly having a hard time to cope with all of it.

**TLDR;** My dad is battling stage 4 Melanoma that's spreading and is currently in an induced coma on the other side of the globe. I'm having a hard time to cope with not only the distance but also the feeling of helplessness due to the fact Covid has pretty much shut down any hopes of my flying there to be with my family and say goodbye.

I guess I'm just looking to vent, and hopefully maybe find some words of encouragement, words of wisdom or anything to help with coping as it just feels overwhelming.",3.0,"['mdigit', 'famrel',

146,My father was diagnosed today. I don’t know whether to stay or go,"Hi everyone, I’m writing this while crying so please bear with me on my inevitable typos. I am 22 years old and live with my parents (mom is 59, dad is 63). My father was diagnosed with cancer of the mouth today, and we think it may also be in his throat. He will have to undergo chemo and radiation. 

I was not at the doctor’s visit, but my mother relayed that due to the pandemic, the doctor suggested we leave the house as little as possible (now and especially when he starts), not even going to the grocery store or work as my dad will be severely immunocompromised. My dilemma is that I don’t know if I can handle this.

I have major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety and I am going to seek out therapy (finally) but I don’t know if I can handle this. I don’t know how many rounds of chemo he’ll have to go through. I don’t know how much longer I’ll be expected to fully isolate at home. And I don’t know if I can handle it regardless. 

I feel so selfish for wanting to move out NOW of all times. But I’ve lived at home my entire life. And quarantine has made my depression so much worse. I have a girlfriend. I have a job that needs me there physically. I have a mental illness that is already exacerbated by regular ol’ quarantine. And my dad has cancer. I don’t know what to do. I need to leave for the sake of my own health, and he wouldn’t be alone, but I feel so selfish and awful.

150,Watching someone die of brain cancer?,"Hi all! I posted this over on the general cancer sub, but I’m now thinking it might not have been the right place.

To be clear, I don’t mean this from an emotional stance, rather that I want to know what to expect to see happening leading to death.

My father (59M) was diagnosed with (grade 4) glioblastoma on the left side of his brain about a month ago and is starting radiation in 2 weeks. Obviously there is no way to know for sure how long he has, but we’ve been told it’s an average of about 11-15 months. 

I’ve just graduated high school and am spending the next year at home to help care for him & spend time with him. I just want to know what to expect. Things are good now, but I know eventually things are going to take a turn for the worse.

What is it actually like to see someone pass away from this? Do start losing who they are? Do they eventually forget to breath? I’m sorry if this is naive, it’s not something I’ve ever expected to have to think about.

I have a grade IV brain tumor (diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M-mutated) in my thalamus. My next scan is on Tuesday and I see my home neuro-onc on Wednesday. I cannot begin to express how terrified I am. If/when my tumor starts growing, I’m most likely going to die. I have a few more options before I have to call it quits, but I am literally going to be clawing for every month until they come up with a cure/more effective treatment or I die. I’m so fucking scared. Like, I already had an anxiety disorder before I was diagnosed, but it’s been so much worse the past few weeks. I really don’t know what I’m going to do if it’s done anything. Have a full mental breakdown in the doctor’s office? Most likely. I cry almost every day because I’m just not ready to go. I’m not ready to leave my family and my best friend (she’s at Princeton for college). I’m just not ready. I’m 18, for fuck’s sake. Did I really deserve this?

166,Refuses to take any medication,"My boyfriend has been prescribed medication for severe anxiety and pain associated with his cancer. 

He has a thing about taking pills. He be hates taking them and flat out refuses to. Even though he's writhing in pain, sobbing crying on the floor he will not take pain pills. 

We talked to the doctor about his refusal to take pills and they put him on the fentanyl patch which has been working for him. They also gave him Gabapentin for nerve pain. Those only come in pills.
They prescribed him liquid Prozac for the anxiety, since he won't take pills and he still refuses to take it. I fought with his insurance company for two weeks to get him the liquid Prozac and he refuses. It's a medication that needs to be taken daily, he refuses to take it because he ""hasn't felt any anxiety today"".

I try over and over to explain to him why he needs to take the meds when he does but he gets angry and defensive. His doctors have explained on several occasions why and he nods along and agrees and tells his doctors of course he's going to take them. Then we get home and he refuses. He gets angry, defensive, tells me that he doesn't need medication because he's tired of having so much medicine in his body. He was just diagnosed with Spindle Cell Sarcoma a month ago. He's been on the meds for a month. He just started chemo today and his doctors AGAIN explained the importance of taking his meds and we got home and he refused. 

I am so incredibly frustrated because I have to fight him on everything regarding his medication. I have to fight him to put a new patch on every 3 days. I have to fight him to take the Prozac. I have to fight him to take his nerve pain medication. I have to fight him to take his nausea medication. I am so freaking tired of fighting him. 

It would be one thing if he didn't really need them. But he's unable to sleep due to panic attacks. He cries and writhes in pain constantly. He needs these medications to make his life livable and he keeps refusing. I've never forced him to take the medication, I know he has the right to refuse it but I can't sleep. He cries and yells all night long either from the pain or the anxiety and I am emotionally, physically exhausted.

I am tired of trying to help him just to be yelled at and insulted and made to feel like I'm abusing him.

170,Mother diagnosed with lung cancer.,"So, this all started a week ago. My mother had a follow up doctor’s visit for a nagging cough that she’d had that had started a few months prior. He’d diagnosed her with asthmatic bronchitis, and when one trial of steroids didn’t work, gave her another. It still hadn’t gotten better.

She hadn’t woken up for her appointment, so I got her up and she started rushing to make it. Her breathing got bad, but she was going to the doctor and I figured she would be okay.

I get a message from her that they’re sending her to the ER. She didn’t mention the ambulance until I called her.

At the ER, they do the CT scan and that’s the first time we hear it. A mass. She also has blood clots, a lot of them, small and in her lungs. Fast forward a week and she’s had a bronchoscopy. The pulmonologist confirms that it looks like NSC cancer. The biopsy results will be back Thursday/Friday.

I’m so scared. I’ve been living with my Mom since my divorce and I’m disabled thanks to Ehlers Danlos syndrome, but I’m still her caretaker. I’m in the process of begging for disability (3 years and a hearing into the process) and I don’t know what I’ll do without her, emotionally, spiritually, or financially. I don’t think the news will be good, but I’m trying so hard to stay positive. She’s very positive, but I’m so afraid she’s in denial.

173,Depression and Anxiety,"My mom was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer last August (and on my birthday, no less). It was in her bones, but luckily, nowhere else. Since then, I've struggled with severe depression and anxiety. I do my best to keep it together so that I can better care for my mom during this time, but lately I've just been so depressed. I have spoken to my doctor about it and we started a treatment plan for my depression and anxiety, but nothing seems to be working. 

My mom completed chemo in December, but she needs to do immunotherapy for life in order to manage the cancer. What triggers my anxiety is the thought that anything and everything can take a turn for the worst at any moment.

174,What to expect when they stop Maintanence chemo,"I (40F) had previously posted about my dad (70) from another account which I can no longer access. He has AML with acute panmyelosis with fibrosis. He’s been on experimental chemo for last two months (after a year of regular chemo) but has become very weak and is fighting a lung infection that requires an anti fungal medication that can’t be used at the same time as the experimental chemo. He is in between cycles atm (cycles last 25 days on and 3 days off) and they were delaying the start of next cycle so he could have more days on the anti fungal. The dr said today they don’t know how much longer his body will cope with the infection and chemo so they have suggested he come hone from hospital to be with family and friends in a comfortable environment. They can’t give any time frame on how long he’ll live. Mum is hoping a couple of weeks at least. They have been giving him blood and plasma every day or two which I’m sure is helping keep him alive. At this stage it’s not been made clear to me if they will be providing that when he goes home.
Can anyone give any insight in regards to what to expect?
Anyone have any idea of timeframes based on experience with their family members?

My daughter has had a strange skin condition almost her whole life. She has these small bumps on her head,back,neck and hips. We finally decided to take her to a dermatologist 2 weeks ago and they gave us some different medicines to see if we could get them to go away. We couldn’t so they decided to do a biopsy a week ago and we just found out that it’s an externally rare skin cancer. So rare that the doctors aren’t even sure how to treat it. We have to take her in to get some blood samples and an MRI. I’m in shock. I just can’t believe that something like this could happen to a toddler. A FUCKING TODDLER. We won’t even be able to explain to her what’s happening and why it’s happening. It’s impossible for her to understand. I’m so scared that it’s going to get worse.

I have been offered and have accepted palliative chemotherapy to try and give me as much time as possible with my family. 

The problem lies in the fact they cannot and will not accept what is happening.

178,My boyfriend is dying to stage 4 throat cancer.,"Where do I start? Well 7 months my boyfriend(42) got diagnosed with stage 4 throat cancer. We’ve been together for 8 years and when this happened we were shocked as well as our families. Everything was going well, we started chemo in October every 2 weeks for 36 hours. This holiday season was rough but we both made it through. In January we had a second PET scan done and the results were great. The doctor was really happy that the cancer had shrunk and everything was going according to plan. We were happy because only 6 more chemo treatments and we could ring the bell!! Well mid February things got worse, cancer had spread to the bones and nervous system. He has been in the hospital since then. 

Yesterday was a good day, he was smiling and some what talking to us. But today everything changed. When I went to see him, he could talk and was heavily breathing. The nurse was talking about time lines to his parents and I. That’s when it happened. It hit me like a truck. This guy whom I’ve been with for 8 freakin years will not be coming home. This guy who I shared a home with won’t be back in it. Also the guy who I really love won’t be here anymore. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve kept the strong front for his parents and brother but they finally saw me break down and walk out the room. Just could do it anymore. 

Sorry for the wall of text just had to get this off my chest.

180,It's been 5 days.,"I once posted on a confessions page here about my mother's cancer and my fear of returning to university because of it. Thankfully I came back within a week of being away. 

Last Thursday, she passed away at 4.50am in the morning. We'd gotten a call to come to the hospice immediately but missed her by 10 minutes. Her hands were still warm when we got there. I hugged her and it still felt like she was with us. The music we had put on for her was still playing, even though she was no longer here to hear it. I've been replaying the events of that day in my mind over and over for the past few days. When they told us she'd left us, when she was cremated, when we immersed her ashes in the sea. It all happened in 2 days. 

I think she might've known her time was coming to an end. She was a huge coffee lover. On the day before she passed, she asked my dad to make her a cup of coffee. She had 2 teaspoons of it and didn't want the rest. Not once in the 2.5 weeks she was hospitalised did she make a request like that. 

I went to her office for the first time after her passing 2 days ago. It was painful but comforting to look through her things. It's all I have of her now. I learned so much about her in the time I was there. She never struck me as a fiercely sentimental person as she was always so private. I found so many letters she had written to people about me when I was young. I knew she loved me, but I never realised how much. 

I always knew she'd experienced a lot of hardship in her life. I never truly knew how much until that day. It made me angry at cancer, that it would target someone who had already gone through so much. I wish I could've held her close and shared her pain when she was still alive. I wish I could've talked to her about all I learned. I hope she knows how proud I am to call her my mother. I wish she could've had more time to be happy. But I'm comforted by the fact that she's finally at peace.

181,My Mom is Getting a Port for Chemo Today,"Hi Community, I am not sure what I am looking for but perhaps reassurance that my mom is making the right choice with the port. She will be in surgery shortly so nothing will change but she s concerned about the chemo that will come with the port. Today is Friday and on Monday will be her first port chemo session, 2 days at home.

She got really, really sick with the chemo pills last time. She couldn’t eat or drink for weeks. We think she pushed herself too far and got really dehydrated which made matters worse but we are hoping it will work out better with the port so at least it goes direct to her blood rather than processed through her stomach (already difficult with Stage 4 Gastric Cancer).

Any experience in this area would be appreciated. Thanks!

185,Caring for my young wife,"Hello everyone. I was turned to this sub from a kind redditor who spoke very highly of your support, and reading through the posts it seems like a wonderful and safe place to unburden oneself of all the pain and confusion that is borne from the situations we find ourselves in. I thank you in advance for your time in reading through our story.

Last year, my fiancee was diagnosed with stage 3 triple-negative breast cancer at the age of 28. We went through the whole treatment plan (chemotherapy, single side mastectomy, and radiation), and our scan last October showed no signs of the disease and were told she was cured. Of course we were absolutely ecstatic, feeling secure enough to make plans for our future without fear. But our time of peace only lasted a mere 4 months. She had a seizure in late January of this year, and this led us to finding out that the cancer had metastasized to her brain, adrenal gland, and both lungs. We were terrified, but at least it's treatable and we would have some time together still, albeit absurdly short (the doctor estimated about 5 years).

So we started chemotherapy (ixabepilone) and were hoping that everything was going well. But in late February she started complaining of severe discomfort in her back (consistently rating her pain level at a 7 or 8) so we made a visit to the emergency room, which ended up with us being admitted for 5 days: the chemotherapy wasn't working. In that time we learned that her cancer had spread to her kidneys and adrenal gland, liver, and pancreas. She also had another seizure which led us to finding six small tumors in her brain.

We recently finished going through whole brain radiation treatment and have started another type of chemo (Eribulin) this last Friday (and immunotherapy once she's completely off steroids).

She's my best friend and soul mate. We've been together for 3 and a half years and engaged for 3. Before being sent home by the palliative care team (which did get her pain under control with long acting morphine) we decided to get married, officiated by the hospital chaplain.

I'm thankful that we still have treatment options, but I am so so so worried that this next chemo won't work. The oncologist had told us that due to the aggressiveness of her cancer we can expect a year if this new treatment works: if it doesn't, we horrifically expect to have only another 6 months together.

I'm losing her so fast. How the fuck am I supposed to say goodbye to my best friend? She is a glass half full type, and has hope that this treatment will work and that an immunotherapy we're scheduled for (PD-1 inhibitor) will yield good results. But either way, a year will not be enough. No amount of time will ever be enough.

And it's so hard to enjoy the time we do have together with this spectre looming above us. We are realistic and open with each other, so our days are filled with as much laughter and joy as we can fit between the intermittent bouts of sobbing in each other's arms, lamenting the notion that she very well may not make it to her thirties, and that I will undoubtedly be a very young widower.

I am so not ready to say goodbye to the love of my life, and I know I never will be. She is so goddamn young, all the plans we had for our lives have been crushed within just a few months.

This is the most horrific and absurd way I can imagine to learn how unfair life really is. I'm not just terrified of losing her one day: I'm terrorized with the thought that I will have to watch my beautiful wife endure more and more pain and suffering as the months tick by.

I don't know how to do this.",4.0,"['caring', 'young', 'famrel', 'everynumber', 'turned', 'sub', 'kind', 'spoke', 'highly', 'support', 'reading', 'through', 'posts', 'seems', 'like', 'wonderful',

186,"Boyfriend battlilng third round of cancer, need some advice.","Hi everyone.

Since July of 2015 I have been in an on-again and off-again relationship with my boyfriend. He was diagnosed with stage 2 lymphoma and when it went to stage 3 he ended our relationship. He went into remission a month after treatment, then was re-diagnosed with more cancer cells in different lymph nodes and went through treatment again. I have always been a supporter as we started off as friends and were freshly a new couple when his health started failing, and even when things were bad and we were ""broken up"" we had always had a non-labeled relationship where we acted like a couple even when we weren't officially a couple. In January of 2017 I moved to FL from CT to work on an internship for school. We briefly stopped talking for 3 months and then we started talking again in July and about a month later we started dating again. He was re-diagnosed with cancer, this time non-melanoma skin cancer that he got when his doctor's put him through an aggressive radiation treatment. He was optimistic about this form of cancer since to him it seemed a much easier battle to deal with than what he went through a year prior.

Well, in November when I came home to visit things seemed normal even as he waited for his treatment plan. About two weeks after my visit when I went back to Florida for the last six weeks of my internship, there was a shift in personality. We got into a huge fight because he was angry I went to a company holiday party. I thought he was being irrational and he would constantly be angry that I was never in my apartment (when you live with 5 other females do you blame me?) and would fly off the handle over minuscule things that never bothered him before. Come to find out, he had started taking chemo pills and they were making him ill. He was unable to hold any food down and was eating saltines and water in order to keep any nutrition in. He sounded emotionally defeated on the phone and he told me that he was avoiding his family so he also wanted to avoid me because he wanted to break up with me but he didn't want to make the mistakes he had made in the past, so he told me when I got home and he started getting better our relationship would start getting better.

I am home, and we haven't spoken in three weeks. I keep my distance but at the same time I am worried sick about him because on December 23rd he started his actual chemo on top of the pills. I know being involved with someone with cancer is putting your own feelings aside and just being supportive, but I feel so lost and confused as to how to be supportive when he doesn't want me or anyone in his life. I have a phobia he is going to die and I'll never know or get to say goodbye. My aunt died from kidney failure and complications from hemo-dialysis so I live with this fear that I will never be able to get that kind of closure. Is this normal behavior from someone enduring chemo? He refuses any kind of counseling or support network and even when I have mentioned side effects of treatment in the past he was very insecure and felt like he was ""gross"" for having cancer. My friends and family don't understand, they see it as he is being abusive because they don't understand the psychological toll cancer takes. Any form of advice would help, I feel so lost and don't know who to turn to.",7.0,"['friend', 'battlilng', 'third', 'round', 'cancer', 'need', 'some', 'advice', 'everynumber', 'since', 'month',

187,DONE!!!!,"Quick recap, found out in October that I had Thyroid Cancer that had also spread to some Lymph Nodes.  I had surgery in November and did Radioactive Iodine early December.  I did my scan before Christmas and they found more Cancer in  some Lymph Nodes they left behind.  I had to have another surgery and that went wonky coming out of anesthesia.

&#x200B;

Officially got the word that I'm all clear!!!!  No more surgeries and no more Iodine.  Because my Thyroid is completely gone now though I have to keep up with blood tests and that will help keep track of everything.  Man is that a huge weight off of my shoulders.  I never had to deal with anyone minimizing my cancer but the doctors kept reminding me how ""easy"" it is compared to others, but fuck is it still a scary monster.  

&#x200B;

I wanted to share this because this community has to be one of the best out there on Reddit.  I've never felt such love or support from anyone.

191,Cancer is taking my Dad from me..,"It's been almost a year since my Dad was diagnosed with Stage 4 Colon Cancer that metastasized to his Liver, and it's been a tough year for him mentally and physically. 

It all started when my Dad and stepmom noticed a 'knot' underneath his right rib. Went to his GP and she sent him to a Gastrointestinal Specialist to check him out. The first visit they just did xrays and was told that he had tumors covering his left and right lobes on his liver. This man, who was just the nurse because the actual Dr wasn't there, basically told us that it was useless, that nothing would help him. Worst News Ever..😟
We then made an appointment with his now Oncologist, who is amazing by the way, and he said he wouldn't be able to tell us anything without a colonoscopy and a liver biopsy done. The colonoscopy showed a 6cm 'mass', Cancer, 3cm inside his rectum and the liver biopsy did indeed show Cancer. Dads Oncologist told him this news and it broke my heart because my Dad doesn't deserve this horrible disease. The Oncologist, Dr Boniol, told us that without any chemo treatment, he had maybe 3 months to live. This wasn't an option for me. Chemo and Radiation it is. Even Worse News..😥
Dad had an appointment the same day as the colonoscopy to get his Port Placement done. While he was in surgery for that, I walked to the Cancer Center, which is in the same hospital area, and made his appointment for his first round of Chemo. While making the appointment at the Cancer Center I was told insurance hasn't approved treatment yet, so the nurse called Boniol. This great Dr told the nurse to go ahead and schedule the appointment, without insurance approval, because he knows without it my Dad won't make it. Best Dr Ever..💙💚
Chemo first: 12 rounds of FOLFOX and 10 rounds of Avastin is the Chemo he will have. Besides the neuropathy and occasional nausea he was doing great, until his 9th FOLFOX/7th Avastin. He wasn't feeling good and was having trouble swallowing. Dad was taken to the ER because we was scared of something going wrong, boy were we right! His blood sugar was 867 when he was admitted into the hospital and extremely close to, well nothing good. Boniol said the Avastin can sometimes bring out diabetes in someone that already has a mild case of it, we had no idea. Dad was very lucky to be alive on this day. So he now has Colon/Liver Cancer and Diabetes. WTF!!😤
Fast forward to Dad finishing the FOLFOX/Avastin Chemo treatments. He gets his first scan done after Chemo and they show that the Chemo has indeed worked on the Colon Cancer. 👍
Up next will be Sirtex Radiation Beads to treat his Liver Cancer. This will only be 2 rounds of this treatment, one round for each lobe. The Sirtex Beads will be injected directly into his liver, instead of throughout his whole body, and they will then stick to the Cancer and fight it. The 1st treatment went real good for Dad. I mean, he was really low on energy for about a week after but he evened out around the 2nd week. The 2nd treatment hit him worse. His energy level is crazy low and we, my stepmom and I, have noticed that he has started being not as positive at the outcome after all his treatments. He's Scared Now..😰
Almost 2 weeks after his 2nd Radiation treatment, he was having bowel issues, memory loss, trouble swallowing food and he's lost tons of muscle in his body. My stepmom and I took him to the ER and the CT Scan showed 2 spots on his brain and that means, within the past week or so, Dad had a Stroke. He has no idea when he had the Stroke, so we're thinking it happened in his sleep. Which scares all of us because that means he's lucky he even woke up from it.. What's Next..😩
Since the Stroke happened Dad has been an emotional wreck. When anyone tells him that they love him, he gets tears in his eyes. He's scared to death of what's happening to him, I can see it in his eyes. My stepmom and I have been to each and every Dr appointment since this started and we are constantly telling him that it's okay to be scared, because it's the unknown. He has no idea what all this will end up becoming and it scares the shit out of him. 🤯
All the family has repeatedly told him that we are all here for him, for no matter what he needs/wants and not to be scared to talk to any of us, to which he usually replies that he doesn't wanna be a bother to anyone. We have all been trying to assure him that he is no bother at all and that we will all be there for him, even if he doesn't want us to help.😌
Dad told me today that he's glad that I, his only daughter, has been there to help him and my stepmom from the beginning. Said he doesn't want to think of where he'd be if I wasn't there to help them both throughout all of this disease. I told him that he took care of me growing up and that it was my turn to help take care of him.😥
Even after me reassuring him again that he is no bother at all to me if he needs anything from me. This is my Dad and he has been a great Dad. If there is anything I can do to make him forget for a moment about his situation, I will. If there is anything I can do to make sure he knows that I'm not going anywhere, I will. This man is my rock and I will be forever grateful that he was chosen to be my Dad. I will love him forever and will make sure he knows how much I love him forever!💗
Thanks to anyone to reads my families Cancer story and if anyone has any advice on what I can do to help my Dad, please let me know. I appreciate any help to help my Dad.

192,I feel like they think I don’t care,"Hi everyone! Hope you’re all doing well. I just wanted to come on here to say something. My dad got some pretty bad news from the doctor, he has a limited amount of time yet, but I’m not sure how much (my mom said they didn’t wanna get into it with the doctor) and she’s been really upset lately. I feel like my family thinks I’m weird because I don’t cry or show any emotion around my parents, but when I’m alone I cry and get really upset.. I want to be strong for them, so that’s why I don’t cry and stay neutral. just imagining me in my dad’s position makes me really sad, I’m only 25 and have my whole life ahead of me. I want to talk to my mom about things, but I don’t want to make her more upset than she already is. One of my professors at school told me I can talk to her about it whenever, so I may do that.

193,My mom,"Update: It’s the next day and I feel a lot better, I really want to thank you for your kind words. Your messages helped me be able to sleep, I’m still tired but I did sleep well. My mom is doing good, she slept well. I let her read you messages and she liked them a lot. I have accepted that this is the situation we’re in right now, so I try to be as cheery as I can and to help my mom as much as I can. She is very strong, she’s only 49 and very fit. So she will get through this, I know it. And I will help her every day as much as I can. Thank you again for your messages, it really helped a lot 💕

Update 2: Just read the news about Chadwick Boseman, I’m very heartbroken. It is a shock because it’s the same type of cancer. But I won’t let it scare me, it doesn’t scare my mom.

——

We got the news today that my mom has cancer in her intestines. I just can’t stop crying, I don’t know how to deal with this. We don’t have further news yet, so I’m trying to stay positive. It’s just that so much is happening at once this week and it’s just too much

195,I want to talk about caretaking/terminal illness.,"Hello all. I am about to begin directing a play that deals with grief, terminal illness, and the role of the caretaker. In short, a woman watches as her husband gradually dies due to an irreversible illness (no specific illness specified). It's also worth mentioning that both are in their late 20s, so there is also an extreme life-cut-short factor in the play as well.

Thankfully, I have not had a parallel situation that makes much of this easily relatable in my  own life. In the interest of telling the story with integrity, I wanted to see if anyone might be generous enough to share their stories, either as a caretaker or someone who has dealt with terminal illness.

197,My mom is battling stage 4 breast cancer and I’m devastated,"My (26) mom (65) was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer back in October 2019. She started chemotherapy right before Christmas and it did more harm than good. It almost took her life and she ended up in the Emergency Room with sepsis.

Now, she’s been in a rehab nursing facility for almost a month and I don’t know what will happen. I’m her only daughter and I live over 6 hours away by car. I’ve been visiting her every weekend and sometimes I feel like I’m not doing enough. My heart aches to see her in so much pain. Some days are good, but some days are bad because her immune system is so weak. Lately, she’s been feeling depressed and hopeless. I don’t want her to feel that way, but sometimes I feel that way too and I don’t want her to give up :( Her illness really impacts my emotions and I feel so overwhelmed. I have to deal with figuring out her doctors appointments, insurance coverage, bills, etc. It’s a lot on my mind and I don’t even know if I’m handling this well.

On the other hand, I don’t think my dad is handling this well either. He’s been by her side everyday, but when he comes home, he doesn’t even know how to do his own laundry because my mom has always done it for him. He’s old and has his own health issues to deal with and the whole family is hurting.

How can I help her fight through this? Or how can I even deal with this better? I’ve been leaning onto my family and friends for support, and now I’m asking online strangers for help.

198,Recurrence Sucks - But I will fight it with everything I have,"For background, 7 months ago, I had neurological symptoms on my right side, resulting in a dropped foot and weak glute. As my stumbling got worse and worse, an MRI revealed a GBM IV in my spinal cord in the L5 region.  Emergency surgery ensued and 6 months of physical therapy later, I've been making head ways. Walking on my own (with a cane), hanging out with friends and all that good stuff. Also, I'm 31.

&#x200B;

Last week my ankle on my left side started feeling weak. I felt like something was up, but wasn't sure what. I just got the scans back from my MRI yesterday. The last scan was only 4 weeks ago, and it showed nothing. Yup, it's back. My worst nightmare. My mom and my wife cried, and I sat there simply asking about next steps. I just need a path I can work towards. I will hopefully be going on a clinical trial which has had positive effects on stabilizing and reducing the cancer. I'm positive, despite the bad news.

&#x200B;

But I wanted to do this...This is something I've been thinking about all day. I want to make a declaration. Something that I can look back to and know without a shadow of a doubt that I will use all my mental and physical strength to fight this.

&#x200B;

I hereby declare that I will fight this cancer until it no longer exists in my body. I will not let it impact the quality of my life. I will not let it define me, my character or my love. We all live on borrowed time, and the time I have from here on out will be the most special, the most epic, the most meaningful I have ever lived. I will not let this mutation be a menace. I will take it, deconstruct it and turn this into an experience from which I gather strength and wisdom. When I look back on this declaration, I will know what I already feel in my heart and mind. I am stronger than anything which afflicts me. I am a survivor. I will be like a cockroach that lives through the toughest of times, only to make it out on the other side, as if nothing happened. There's no turning my back on this. I have family that loves me, friends and colleagues that support me. I will do it for them. I also have 2 lovely cats, Manny and Butler. I will do it for them too. I will do it for this community too.

201,Just found out my stepfather has a brain tumor,"Hey y’all. 

I found out this thing about my stepdad yesterday. My stepdad and I couldn’t be more different, but I have known him for so long. He is a good man, and has done so right by my mom.

I am struggling because we have never been really comfortable talkers together. We love each other and have said so much a few times, but I am pretty weird about emotions, and I don’t want him to think that I am ungrateful for all of the wonderful thing he has done for me. I also don’t want him to think that I am accepting his death so readily because I know that is not on the table. That is art of getting a bit older, I know.

My mom is a strong lady, and we are close now, but I can’t stop thinking about her. I know she must be having a rough time, and she has really been there through some bullshit with me, and I need to be a strong one for her. And for him; he dealt with me in my teens, and I was a total butthole for like 8 years. 

I am all stream-of-consciousness right now, but I am really hoping I get there. Treatment comes next, and then I don’t know. 

Staying positive for my loved one, I think writing this down makes me want to let him know without freaking him out, you know? No one wants to believe they’ll be here.

203,Chores (x-posted Cancer),"My husband has been on disability for over a year now. Because he is home all day, but not completely incapacitated (the disability was more due to vision/his particular job being risky), he had been doing most of the daily chores around the house. He does the grocery shopping, over half the cooking, loaded dishwasher, his laundry, and takes care of the dog and garbage.

I worked, tutored, babysat, did my laundry, unloaded the dishwasher, vacuumed and did the bathroom on the weekends, and cooked the remaining meals.  

It was a great system.  Everything was pretty equally distributed and everything got done.

But now he was in the hospital all last week for unexplained pain.  The pain is making his fatigue worse, and also (obviously) making him extremely uncomfortable. When he takes the pain pills, he becomes very dizzy and disoriented and often naps. As such, we're trying to come up with a new symptom until his pain recedes.

How have you handled household chores? It would be unrealistic for me to do everything with my schedule (I often work 50+ hours a week before my extra jobs).  Should I try hiring a maid for some of the things? I feel weird asking family members to come wash our stinky, sweaty sheets (night sweats), but would feel less weird paying a stranger, haha.

204,Struggling with emotions,"So to cut the longest part of the story short, I lost my aunt to pancreatic and liver cancer just before Christmas, and we had her cremation on Christmas Eve.  At her funeral my mum was in a significant amount of pain, but my mum being as stubborn as a mule, it took almost everyone in attendance to tell her to go to the doctor's.

Fast forward to new years eve and mum has been to the doctor's and he wanted her to be admitted to hospital immediately that day as he was concerned about her renal function.  So she goes to the hospital and they run all relevant tests and discover a mass on her ovaries, and she has started to get a large build up of fluid in her abdomen.  She remained in hospital for about 2 weeks so they could drain the fluids and keep an eye on her kidney function.

After her stay in hospital she returned home, but was very weak and remained in bed most of the time.  It's now 30th January and we go to an appointment with the oncologist to find out where we are with the discovery.
During the appointment mum was in extreme amounts of pain so the appointment had to be cut short because the oncologist wanted her back in the hospital, but before she went back he did disclose to me and my dad that it was aggressive but didn't say much more than that.

So we get her back the hospital (which for me was the most difficult ambulance journey of my life, not only did I fear for my mum's life but never did I think that I would have to use training in restraint on my own mum) and she is pretty whacked out from the oramorph, and after more tests we are told she would need to go to CDU to get an infection under control in her kidneys.  Before she went down a doctor there took me, my dad, my brother and my sister to a separate room and told us that the cancer is stage 4, and that the mass is obstructing her kidneys not allowing them to function properly (worst moment of my life)

So after a couple of days in CDU she is taken back to the ward so we can start preparing for any imminent treatment that she would need in the small hope that she can beat this.  But over the next 24 days I had to watch my mum slowly either away and die and she succumbed to her cancer on the 23rd February 2020, truly the most difficult day of my life and I just don't know how to process this.  My friends, family and even work have all been nothing but amazing during all of this, but even with that support I just don't know to process the fact that I'll never speak to her again, or hear her laugh again, or have my son grow up knowing just how awesome she was, I know I can tell him about her as he grows but it's just not the same is it?  That is the hardest thing for me, knowing he won't have her in his life as he grows up.

If you took the time to read this I really do thank you, I find it extremely difficult to express how I'm feeling to people who can't see how I'm feeling, so if any of this didn't make sense I apologise

205,Caregiving is gross,"Tonight, after a long hard day, my mother finally worked through her chemo “back up” and pooped for a hour. Poop on the floor. Poop in her chamber pot. Poop in her diaper. Poop on her legs and back side. I cleaned it all.  I got her medicated and in bed only to hear her get up again as I try to finish some documents for work. 

Is it wrong that I’m more worried about her getting poop on my favorite sheets that came from my grandma’s house? I’ll clean it up anywhere else and I have. I just hope those sheets stay clear of the battle. 

This life is not for the faint of heart. I never thought I’d have to do this for anyone but my kids. I love my mom. She feels most dignified when it’s me doing clean up and not my siblings or spouse.

207,Found out I have lung cancer today. Trying to hold it together.,"I'm 42, and I went to the ER with sudden extreme pains in my left abdomen the day after Thanksgiving. I thought it was kidneystones, so did they, until the ultrasound didn't show any, but x-ray caught part of a mass in my lower left lung. I went in for CT scans and then a PET scan, which came back negative. I had a biopsy on Christmas Eve and another 3 days later because the first had to be stopped due to me not being sedated deeply enough. With the PET scan being negative, my pulmonologist was really not expecting cancer, but today I found out they found neuroendocrine carcinoid tumors with metaplastic bone formation. I have a large spherical mass about 3.8cm diameter in my lower left lung, and other growths in my airway. It is spread to my lymph nodes.

The doctors from the different disciplines are all getting together to have a meeting to discuss the diagnosis/prognosis/treatment. So I don't know exactly what stage it is classified as, but I know it's not good.

So it's a tough NYE, and I'm wondering if I will see another. Probably being overdramatic, but it's definitely in my thoughts. I'm trying to take it all in and enjoy my family and the festivities. My kids and step kids are playing, my wife is making dinner, and there is cheesecake in the fridge. There's so much to enjoy.  Tell them all how much you love them, everyday.

208,My sister recently passed from breast cancer. How can I best support my parents while they cope with losing a daughter?,"My sister battled stage 4 metastatic breast cancer for 7 years and lost her battle at the beginning of May. She was in remission and it was sudden- we didn’t get a chance for the big dramatic movie scene of a candlelight vigil by her bed while we say our tearful goodbyes. Her 10 year old daughter found her on the floor before she left for school in the morning. 

My mom was one of her main caregivers since the diagnosis. My sister and her husband had been basically separated for 3 years due to his infidelity (what a gem, right?), he hadn’t been living at their house and they were two months until the divorce was finalized. My mother is a nurse and had been preparing for this to happen. My father on the other hand was in deep denial that this would ever happen and never wanted to make plans. For him, he not only lost a daughter, but also his best friend. He couldn’t even look at pictures or talk about it for the first few days until the wake. He is back at work which has helped. 

As we look toward the next few months to years, to the rest of our lives- my brother and I are trying to find the best way to support our parents (while still coping with our own grief). I went on binge cleaning mode at their house for the first three weeks but I am now returning to work (this all happened while on maternity leave- writing at obit at 1am while nursing a 2 month old is not amazing).

Any ideas or suggestions on how to support them? Any similar stories?

I am the youngest sibling, but I am the only child who knows so far. I’m also the closest with my dad. I think my mom expects me to tell my older brother and sister but my heart is so broken right now and I don’t know what to say.

It’s Saturday night and I just had three awesome days in a row with my family. My parents found all this out earlier in the week and did not want to tell me or the other kids right away so as to not ruin our fun (because this is the first time me and my siblings have all been together for a long time).

I’m mostly posting this because I don’t feel as close with my friends anymore because I haven’t seen most of them for months due to COVID19. The only person I’ve told is my roommate who I am very close with. I’m just so frustrated and sad because I care about my dad so much.

She was the most amazing woman. She was a nurse for over 25 years and when we worked at the same organization I heard so many times from patients how much they loved her. She was compassionate, strong, fiercely independent, and had the best laugh. I would always try so hard to get her to laugh so I could hear it. Screw you cancer for taking her from me. It isn't fair.

211,It happened..,"So I posted awhile back in here just to get my mind off of things and well, today it happened. My mom passed away. The last few days have been pretty awful as she declined rather quickly. Last night I had my friend, boyfriend, niece and her husband surrounded by her just waiting and wondering what would happen. The noises she made are something I won't forget. The pain she was in must have been awful and it hurt so much to see her that way.   
Around 3AM my friend, niece and her husband left. We didn't know exactly what would happen and so we needed rest. We had heard in the state she was in could last up to 24-48 hours. I fell asleep and my boyfriend stayed by her side. This is what hurts the most because while he tried to wake me up multiple times, I groaned and said, ""I'm too tired"" ""One minute.""  
Around 7AM he came up and told me I needed to come downstairs. He went back down after I said I will in a minute, yet again. When he came back up he had told me he thought she had passed and I immediately shot up and called my friend. The moment walking downstairs and seeing her so still is just heartbreaking. My friend and niece rushed over and it was all a blur. I called so many people and my body felt numb.   
Before they took her away I said a few things to her because like my usual self, I was too much of a coward to say anything to her while she was still here. I did pray before I fell asleep, when she was still here.  
Knowing that I'll never see her or talk to her again hurts me. What hurts me the most is the fact that I regret these years of how we treated each other. I wish I had been a better daughter to her and made her loved like I knew she wanted to. Yet I let the past and my anger towards her leave me unable too. I did love and care for my mom. I just didn't show it to her in the way I should have. I tried my best to take care of her in the last few weeks, yet I wish I did more.   
The feelings come in waves. Sometimes I feel like I got this and other times I just break down. I have my family around to support me, but sometimes I feel so alone.

212,Dad just got diagnosed,"I haven't been able to stop crying. After a quick google search of his cancer (pancreas) I'm realizing that the odds are absolutely not in our favor. I know that every case is different and every case is specific, but the thought that he might not ever be able to meet my future kids is devastating. He's getting his chemo port next week. 

I want to be there for him and my mom but I have no clue what to expect-- I've never known anyone who has gone through chemo. **What can I do to help? What can I expect?** I know side effects can get ugly, so I will, of course, get explicit permission before helping or seeing him during this time. 

Waiting on more answers is the hardest part right now- I still haven't been told what stage he is, if it's operable eventually, etc. I'm an action-motivated person, and all of the unknowns are really, really frustrating.

225,Health took a sudden turn,"Hi Everyone,

I’ve posted here a few times before. My FIL was diagnosed with esophageal carcinoma last May and has since gone through the treatment and had surgery to remove the cancer from his esophagus. It’s been about 10 weeks since the surgery and he’s been back to the hospital twice due to complications. His bladder is no longer able to function properly so he will have a catheter for the rest of his life and a feeding tube. The doctor was adamant that he would be “like his old self” by May. Here we are two weeks out and he’s in pain like he was before the surgery. This last week his health took a big turn and he’s been unable to provide basic care for himself. He’s become reclused to the bed and cannot hold down any liquids or solids. His urine is an orange rust color and he’s lost about 6 pounds this week. His heart rate has bounced around from 110-130 with lower blood pressure. We know this all likely means he’s severely dehydrated but he refuses to go to the hospital since they will just “hook me up to an IV and send me home”. His pain levels have seemed to spike and my husband and I don’t know what to do anymore. We are both in our 20’s and lucky to be working from home during COVID-19 but will be unable to care for him once this all ends. It is beginning to take a toll on us as we don’t understand why his health took a turn. Maybe he’s just given up? Today, he complained of his lower back hurting and I’m almost certain it’s his kidneys. He’s been on oxy since last September every 4-6 hours and he’s barely able to make it through that timeframe now with his pain. Any suggestions? We called his doctor and they just put him back on an all liquid diet through his feeding tube.

229,I feel sad my daughter never visits [vent],"I (f, 48) was diagnosed with stage 4 de novo breast cancer in February. I've been on chemo until last week when I finished (yay), and I've just started on tamoxifen. My daughter (26) lives 90 mins drive from me. I drove to see her to break the news to her. I feel sad since then she hasn't been to visit once. She has a car, and disposable income, and she doesnt work weekends. I have a guest room all ready for her. 

I feel envious when  I read posts from people whose parents have cancer, and they've quit jobs or school to move back to be close to them.

I have felt very alone throughout chemo. Im divorced, and I only moved here a few months before diagnosis so I hadn't yet made friends, and I haven't been able to get work because of being sick. I have had no one to help: no helpful casseroles, no one to run  a vacuum around the place. I focus on the positives, and seeing a therapist helped a lot. But I have felt very alone and unsupported.

I drove down to visit my daughter three times this year, but driving the distance was hard with the nausea and aches and pains from my medications, and with no income I feel apprehensive about the gas costs for the trip. I couldn't afford to get a motel/hotel overnight so I had to drive there and back in one day, which wasn't ideal.

 I wish so much my daughter would have come up to visit me. No,  I wish she'd *wanted* to visit me. Until now I thought we had a normal, close, loving, functional relationship. We text every couple of days, about shit on reddit, or what's in the news, or something cool she saw in a store. Now I feel I have to reevaluate everything. She's just starting her adult life, so it's normal her focus is on her boyfriend and her career. But when I read posts from other redditors I feel sad we don't have the closeness I thought we did. I'm not sure how I could have been a better mom to have made my daughter want to see me, and I dont feel like I have the physical or emotional energy right now to address this with her.

233,"Well, shit. Really don't want to be here.","I'm a former cancer patient, a survivor, and now I'm a caregiver for my husband. We're both young, have a puppy, a baby on the way, just bought a house, and now this. Shit.

Is it bad that I want to announce the baby news and the cancer news on Facebook in one post so that people get confused and don't know how to reply? I'm that kind of person. I like messing with people. Besides, life has really sucked this last week, I think I deserve some form of enjoyment/entertainment, right?

It's not good. The cancer is on my husband's spine and has significantly reduced his motor function over the last week. We're going straight to treatment so hopefully the damage won't be permanent or get worse.

We're still incredibly lucky. We're in an area with great hospitals and doctors, the same area I was treated for my cancer, we have great insurance, and some other benefits that will help cover our deductible and max out of pocket. I also work in the medical insurance field, so I have lots of close connections with people who are experts at navigating this information and medical claims. My husband and I also have lots of close family (we both hit the in-law jackpot) who are more than willing to help out with all sorts of things including keeping us company at the hospital, helping us move, and prep our new house.

I’m terrified I’ll jeopardize my mother, and I don’t trust the isolation plans she has in place. I’m devastated about losing a parent and can’t lose a second.

My sister is already exposed as an ER nurse and is taking precautions. It’ll be some funeral; no one hugging, muffled behind masks.

237,Bonded by Cancer,"As I waited for my daughter in the waiting room to come back from taking a test, I began to look around. There were people from all walks of life, genders, ages and race. And for once.... race didn’t matter. We were all in one place on common ground. Because we were all bonded by one thing...the fight against Cancer. 

When we talked it was no bad vibes.  You don't feel like anyone thought they were better than the other or because you was white and I was black. When my daughter was at the Benson Center I was on a mental and emotional roller coaster. Daily I met and conversed with many people. Nightly I ate with different families, so you know the food was different everytime lol. But I did learn that eating vegan ain’t so bad. In every verbal or nonverbal encounter the feeling was always mutual. We knew each other was scared, fearful, tired, cried out with no sense of direction. 

I felt good hugging other mothers and sharing my fears, tears and hugs with them. I opened up on Facebook cancer groups and I learned so much. Because no matter how far fetch it seemed.... somebody somewhere went thru it before me or they read something about it or just a simple word of encouragement.

240,My father,"My father has been and still is a very strong man. Like everyone he made mistakes, but it was forgiven. 
I am his oldest daughter, the one he proudly carried around, not that he wasnt proud of my siblings but he learned to ""dad"" with me. 
I remember him teaching me all our ancestors names, pictures hanging on a wall, he would point at them and i would say the name. He was always so happy when i got it right...
My strong father, my return point, my safe house... when I moved away to another country and got married he told me ""no matter how things turn or how far you are, you can always come home to me"".

He was diagnosed with an agressive bladder cancer 3 years ago, doctors removed it, gave him chemo and the next year it was back, stronger and bigger. Same thing, just this time he got a sepsis while recovering on the hospital.

He is very stubborn, that is what the doctor told him when he recovered from that, one kidney was the cost. Chemo didnt sit well with him, food was hard to keep inside, pain on his stomach and a stroke.

Still he kept pushing. Always strong, always smiling when i video call him but he looks like the cancer had aged him, he looks tired sometimes, he looked scared and nervous.

Today he was told the cancer is back, even without a bladder, he still has the same cancer lurking. He had just gotten his hair back. I know he is scared, I am scared too and I am so far away from him.

My father, my safe house, my rock... I love him so much.

It’s super aggressive metastasized melanoma and she’s declining much faster than expected. I came out to be with her for Thanksgiving but couldn’t afford to fly my family with me. 
Last week her oncologist said that her current treatment was no longer working. He suggested an aggressive immunotherapy treatment but it’s very risky. 50% of patience have severe side affects and it can even be fatale. I’ve cancelled my flight home to stay with her through the first treatment.

242,I feel incredibly guilty to grieve my husband's cancer diagnosis,"My husband was diagnosed with Testicular Cancer in 2014, which was 8 months before we met. He was going through a marriage breakup and he'd just fractured his knee. We built a strong bond and married two years later and attempted to start a family whilst he was being monitored with bloods during remission.

I had a traumatic ectopic pregnancy after falling pregnant on our honeymoon so we attempted IVF, all cycles ended in failure.

After going on a cruise in December to try and get into the right frame of mind for further IVF. My husband was diagnosed with a second Testicular Cancer.

Since then he has been cleared and in remission again, we have sperm frozen but he has to have testosterone treatment for the rest of his life now. He has been through so much adjustment I felt like I had to be strong for him but now I feel like I am not allowed to grieve, that I would be attention seeking because I haven't been the patient. I haven't had 3 surgeries in one year.

There obviously aren't many good things about dying from cancer, but over the last 10 years I've found a couple I'd like to share with y'all. 

1. You can crank your headphones to the max all the time because you dont have to worry about long term hearing loss anymore
2. F@&! student loans
3. Don't have to worry about planning anything more than a couple of months in advance
4. Lots of cannabis stores (at least here in CA)  will give you a discount for having cancer
5. Blame all your mistakes on chemo brain

245,A Stepping Stone in the Grieving Process,"Hello everyone-

Mom passed last June from Liver and Bile Duct Cancer and many of you in this group have helped me through this experience.  I thought I'd share something that happened to me today on the way to work that brought me some peace.

I've spent a lot of time crying because mom had to leave, and witnessing how quickly her health diminished each time I traveled down to see her was excruciating.  Having good friends and an excellent partner in life has been very helpful.  I even saw a therapist for a while, but of course, the pain continued.

It wasn't until today that on my way to work I had a random memory of hitting a home run in little league decades ago, and mom whistled the way only she could-- and then yelled out ""yay, Dave!!""  She made me a special dinner that night.  

Before I parked my car at work a big smile came across my face because SHE was my  mom....and that made me feel so lucky.  It was the first memory I've had since she left that brought me a smile.  I think that's a small stepping stone in the grieving process.

To those of you going through this with a loved one, things will get better.  Grief is a long process and you just have to let it happen.  One day you'll have a fond memory come to you and the happy will perhaps outweigh the sad; even for just a moment.

I hope that helps.

&#x200B;

246,"Mourning a loss, but not a death","I left my partner today. He has cancer. He's had it since before we met.


We've always struggled with division of emotional labour within our relationship. When he gets overwhelmed or upset, he shuts off. Whenever he shuts off, I'm left picking up the pieces by myself. He made some progress over the past year, but it was all the product of me *begging* him to address these behaviors.


Today, we got into another fight about a decision he'd made regarding something between us that I didn't agree with. We'd been fighting about it on and off since Saturday. Finally, I found out his reason for this decision, and it turns out that it's tied to something I did months ago that upset him. I didn't even know until today that it upset him. He never addressed it, so what could have been a 10 minute heart-to-heart over what I did the day or even week I did it turned into months of a grudge festering, and him trying to put rules on me that I did not find fair and eventually I just refused to agree to.


Despite all this, I love him dearly. We were otherwise doing well lately. His health has also taken a turn, but we were navigating it as best we could. I spent a lot of time fearing for his passing, but I was building up my own support system so as to not burden him with those fears since I knew he was already carrying fears of his own on that. I'm absolutely devastated that I won't be by his side if/when he does pass. I'm devastated to lose him. I could't carry the relationship on my own, though. I couldn't keep putting energy into conflicts that he was spending more energy trying to retaliate in than resolve. I couldn't keep cutting him slack due to his health. I couldn't take care of myself and him and us all at once.

247,"Welp, we’ve got another problem. My dad’s sister....","I love my aunt, I love her a lot. She lives in California with most of the rest of my dad’s side of the family. She’s kind and she cares about me a lot. However.......when my dad told her that his cancer was going to be fatal, she freaked the hell out and started calling all the rest of their siblings (which is a lot, my dad is the oldest of 13, though some are no longer alive) and saying they needed to start making arrangements and figuring out where to bury him.....IN FRICKIN CALIFORNIA!!! My other aunt, the oldest sister, had to stop her and ask her what the hell she was talking about. Then she had to tell her that he wouldn’t be buried in Cali and my aunt then said of course he would, that’s where his family is buried....which made my other almost smack her and tell her that my mom and my sister and I WERE his family and there was no way in hell he was being buried in California and that made no sense. Took her a bit to figure out why. I was super pissed when I found out. I know it’s stressful when your sibling is dying, but how the hell does she think his wife and children feel? She’s coming to visit either next week or the week after and I honestly don’t know if I can handle her. She’s the baby of that side of the family and holy shit, you can tell.

My cancer took form as a giant mass in my chest that broke my sternum and caused ungodly pain. Nerve pain, bone pain, hard to breathe, the whole nine. I took it pretty well with the help of our good friend opiods. 

BUT, now that my mass has shrunk significantly & my pain is reduced, I'm noticing all these smaller things that are just breaking me. Nausea, UTIs, yeast infections, oral thrush, my eyelashes are falling out and INTO my damn eyes, the fatigue, the way my body just feels WRONG after each chemo, I dont sleep well, and so on. I feel so shakey & unstable & weak. I just want to cry when I wake up because my body feels so wrong.

253,coronavirus delaying cancer treatment rant,"hi, I posted a few days ago that I got diagnosed with invasive urothelial high-grade bladder cancer (at 24). It drives me fucking crazy that I barely made it outside the hospital from my (literally) 2 minute consult and the hospital went into lockdown, cause it will now serve as a coronavirus center. They couldn't book me for another procedure, cause the room that has all the books and calendars is being renovated now -.- asked me to call next week, but I don't see a point now that the hospital only deals with coronavirus. That's the only place I can get my procedure done. Fuck. I may have to have my bladder, uterus and ovaries removed, but won't know until I get that second procedure and the histopathology results come back.

How the fuck did we let this shit spread so widely. It's not going to be only the elderly that the coronavirus may kill. Medicine doesn't end with coronavirus. Fuck all the people who didn't adhere to quarantine rules. Fuck the people who travelled sick (those are the cases that started it in Poland).

I said no, but it's usually nothing after 10 or midnight. We were supposed to be getting up and driving 30 minutes to get fasting bloodwork in the am. 

""Oh. Cause I've been eating chips all night.""

I lost it a little. ""What? That's stupid. Did you think you only had to fast for a couple hours?""

He then got mad at me for calling him stupid and refused to accept my apology. It was stupid but I could have worded it nicer and not snapped. But wtf. It's the middle of the night and I'm stressed. He clearly knew that was wrong which is why he brought it up. Now he's asleep and I'm wide awake.

She asked me what I would do. I was very honest and told her I would take what God had dealt me, and have a few great months and let nature take its course (if not end my own life to not suffer) 

We talked about quality of life. And how that was the only thing I would find acceptable if I was in her shoes. And i take that sentiment VERY seriously. 

Now understand, we have lost several family members to cancer. We all watched my grandmother waste away over several years. Not something I can forget, nor do I care to witness again. 

My moms choice was to go through the treatment and fight. Great. Told her we would he by her side all the way through...and we have. 

I wont bore you with all the details of dealing with her refusing to take meds (yet claiming she wants to get every moment she can in this world) or about the aggressive treatments and all that. 

Which leads to where we are now....

About 8 weeks ago, my mom became bedridden due to a stroke (this is an important detail)  With the stroke, she lost her ability to control her right leg. So...the cancer didnt do this. The stroke did. But if you ask the oncologist, he will claim the chemo treatments are what caused the stroke. Of course all treatment has stopped. 

She is home and under hospice care. And they are wonderful! 2 nurse visits a week. And a caretaker 3 days a week to bathe her and change her bed clothes. Other than that...its all on us 3 children. 

So...this is the schedule I've been living for the last 8 weeks.....

I'm with her from Friday afternoon until midnight Sunday night ( with no relief). At midnight Sunday night,I drive 2.5 hours to work. I work until 9am in a very physical job. I then drive 2.5 hours back to mom, arriving around noon. Take care of her all day lie down at 8pm, get up at 10pm to give her meds, and lie back down. Up again at midnight and start the drive again.  I do this back and forth Monday-Friday  

In between all of that, I change her, feed her and her live in boyfriend who is now showing signs of dementia ( so I take care of him too), 5 cats, 1  dog (which is not housebroken), laundry, housework, etc. It is relentless and endless. 

Now I also have a second business that most can be done by laptop. But I do have meetings to attend. So I squeeze them in with help from my siblings. They generally take the overnight shift so I can work. (And let me tell you that they live 20.mins away....not 2.5 hours like me ) 

I looked at the calendar the other day, and realized I have slept in my own bed only 10 nights in the last 8 weeks. 

I am beyond exhausted! I'm so exhausted that there are times I cant sleep at all. I've gone as much as 36 hours with no sleep. This is how bad it has gotten. 

I've fallen asleep behind the wheel several times. And thankfully I've not wrecked. 

2 weeks ago, I sat down with my siblings and told them no more! They lived closer and needed to step up and do more.  I also explained that if I didnt take care of myself, I wont be around much longer to take care of mom. I'm going to get killed in a car accident. I see it coming! 

So now I get Tuesdays and wednesdays off.  Between them and a couple of other family members, I get 48 straight hours free. Which I use to try and maintain my own home and work. 

But I am so angry! I am finding myself holding some serious contempt for my mom. In my mind, her decision to do this was a futile one. Yes, she has lived past the year mark. But at what expense? She has ZERO quality of life. She is stuck in that bed on a catheter/diaper. Dealing with bed sores. And the only thing she can do for herself is talk and feed herself. 

Everything else is on us kids. (Mostly me)  

How do I get past feeling so bitter that her decision has led ME to have no quality of life. I was so clear at the beginning how I feel about this issue. And I dont know how to cope anymore. I swear I feel like giving up. I'm so exhausted. 

And there is no end in sight. Under hospice care, we no longer get medical tests. We have no idea where the cancer stands, nor how serious her health is.  Which makes it worst! I cant even tell my brain that we only have to do this for so long. 

I know all of this may sound selfish. But it's how I feel. And I know it sounds horrible. 

I thought about seeing a counselor. But where would I find the time? Seriously...I have none. 

I'm so damned tired.",0.0,"['mom', 'has', 'stage', 'digit', 'terminal', 'pancreatic', 'cancer', 'I am', 'angry', 'let', 'preface', 'saying', 'some', 'might', 'make', 'sound', 'like', 'horrible',

260,My mother-in-law is dying of cancer - how can I support my wife?,"My wife and I are US expats and live in Mexico. In June my mother-in-law (85yo) was diagnosed with esophageal cancer.  Her condition was deteriorating so my wife went back to the US in August to be with her. Due to COVID, my wife needed to quarantine for 2 weeks and then demonstrate a negative COVID test before she could see her. The day my wife’s test came back negative, her mother was hospitalized for dehydration and placement of a feeding tube. Due to COVID concerns, my wife was not allowed to visit her in the hospital. My wife has since been at her parent’s house taking care of her dad (93yo) who has early Parkinson’s disease. My MIL was finally able to come home from the hospital this past Friday -  she wants to get her affairs in order then have the feeding tube removed and then go into hospice care. It’s unclear long she will live without the support of the feeding tube. 


Since she left, my wife has not been communicating very well with me aside from a few text messages every day ( She has never been one to chat very much on the phone). I feel like I really need to pry her for information and her responses are short.  Last night I called her just before going to bed (there is a 2 hour time difference). I just wanted to talk and see how she was doing but she began to ask me to do a bunch of things and I told her I was going to bed and  would do them first thing in the morning. She started crying and became angry and hung up. I then received a text saying more of the same along with telling me that I was insensitive and have no idea what she is dealing with.

I really need some advice on how to communicate and support her during this difficult time",7.0,"['famrelinlaw', 'dying', 'cancer', 'how', 'support', 'famrel', 'famrel', 'expats', 'live', 'mexico', 'month', 'famrelinlaw', 'digityo', 'diagnosed', 'esophageal', 'cancer', 'condition', 'deteriorating', 'so', 'famrel', 'went', 'back', 'month', 'due', 'covid', 'famrel', 'needed', 'quarantine', 'digit', 'weeks', 'demonstrate', 'negative', 'covid', 'test', 'before', 'could', 'see', 'day', 'famrel’s', 'test', 'came', 'back', 'negative', 'famrel', 'hospitalized', 'dehydration', 'placement', 'feeding', 'tube', 'due', 'covid', 'concerns', 'famrel', 'not', 'allowed', 'visit', 'hospital', 'famrel', 'has', 'since', 'been', 'parent’s', 'house', 'taking', 'care', 'famrel', 'digityo', 'has', 'early', 'parkinfamrel’s', 'disease', 'mil', 'finally', 'able', 'come', 'home', 'hospital', 'past', 'dayofweek', 'wants', 'get', 'affairs', 'order', 'feeding', 'tube', 'removed', 'hospice', 'care', 'it is', 'famrelar', 'long', 'will', 'live', 'without', 'support', 'feeding', 'tube', 'since', 'left', 'famrel', 'has', 'not', 'been', 'communicating', 'well', 'aside', 'few', 'text', 'messages', 'every', 'day', 'has', 'never', 'been', 'number', 'chat', 'much', 'on', 'phnumber', 'feel', 'like', 'need', 'pry', 'information', 'responses', 'short', 'last', 'night', 'called', 'just', 'before', 'going', 'bed', 'there', 'digit', 'hour', 'time', 'difference', 'just', 'wanted', 'talk', 'see', 'how', 'doing', 'began', 'ask', 'do', 'bunch', 'things', 'going', 'bed', 'would', 'do', 'first', 'thing', 'morning', 'started', 'crying', 'became', 'angry', 'hung', 'up', 'received', 'text', 'saying', 'more', 'same', 'along', 'telling', 'insensitive', 'no', 'idea', 'dealing', 'need', 'some', 'advice', 'on', 'how', 'communicate', 'support', 'during', 'difficult', 'time']",famrelinlaw dying cancer how support famrel famrel expats live mexico month famrelinlaw digityo diagnosed esophageal cancer condition deteriorating so famrel went back month due covid famrel needed quarantine digit weeks demonstrate negative covid test before could see day famrel’s test came back negative famrel hospitalized dehydration placement feeding tube due covid concerns famrel not allowed visit hospital famrel has since been parent’s house taking care famrel digityo has early parkinfamrel’s disease mil finally able come home hospital past dayofweek wants get affairs order feeding tube removed hospice care it is famrelar long will live without support feeding tube since left famrel has not been communicating well aside few text messages every day has never been number chat much on phnumber feel like need pry information responses short last night called just before going bed there digit hour time difference just wanted talk see how doing began ask do bunch things going bed would do first thing morning started crying became angry hung up received text saying more same along telling insensitive no idea dealing need some advice on how communicate support during difficult time

264,Hospice = no hope?,"When your loved one has stopped treatments and started hospice care, is it time to stop hoping and start grieving?

The person in hospice care is only 30 years old, and has been my good friend for well over a decade. She has been suffering with stage 4 ovarian cancer for 6 months now. Chemo and radiation did nothing for her. (3 years ago had stage 1 ovarian cancer which went away with chemo after 8 months, cancer-free for 1.5 years, now here we are.)

She is also my roommate. She would be living at home with her parents, but they live in a state where her insurance is not covered. (She does visit them often, they live only 30 minutes away)

She hasn’t started hospice yet, but it’s making me super anxious on top of all the grief/sadness, knowing that I’ll have to watch her die a little more each day. I feel selfish for even feeling that anxiety.  How can I take care of my heart, while I stay a good friend to my dying friend?

266,Dad is in remission but is eating less and less,"It’s a constant struggle getting my dad to eat since he finished radiation and chemo. 
He had to have all his teeth removed and he complains that his dentures don’t fit and they gag him. Also, he just constantly reiterates that things don’t taste “right”. 

Anybody have any experience with soft diets or calorie dense food that I can prepare for him and that will be easier to ingest?
It seems like everything he tries to eat irritates his throat and he starts coughing and then usually gives up trying to continue eating.
I know once he starts eating and his body starts to heal there’s a good chance his taste buds might come back. (The doctors emphasize MIGHT, but I’m hopeful)

267,So. I just found out I have early breast cancer and that I’m pregnant. Still haven’t told my SO about pregnancy. But I just found out that the guys trip he was supposedly taking was a vacation with another woman. So much going through my mind and heart.,Update: went for an ultrasound and apparently my hormone levels are being effected by the cancer so i am not pregnant. BUT he thought i was making it all up because I was mad about the trip he was just on which he insists was a “group” trip which is a lie. Thank you all so much for your support and kindness.

269,Lost my mom to Stage 4 cancer,"Hello everyone F (20 years old), 

On 10/13/2020 I lost my beautiful, strong, and the most amazing lady in my life. She was battling stage 4  colon cancer for 3 almost 4 years and never gave up. I mean this lady fought till her last breathe. And once she passed she had the biggest smile on her face. I’ve  heard such amazing stories about my mom after she passed, visiting her loved one in their dreams. My brother in law and my nephews told me she visits all the time because they could see spirts sorry if that’s weird to you guys but it brings me so much peace. God works in mysterious ways, I was blessed and I’m extremely grateful I was able to spend the last 3 days with her in the hospital along with my sisters and dad. It’s was the most scariest moment of my life. It breaks my heart I won’t have the motherly love my mom gave me anymore, I’m only 20 years old and I can’t even imagine life without her 5 years from now. There’s days I cry and there’s times where I’m trying to keep going but manage to always breakdown after holding it in. I feel crazy, but I also don’t think I’m ready to accept my mom is gone. It seems as if she hasn’t responded to my messages because she’s been busy. I want to her back guys, It’s not the same without my mom here. I’ve watched my mom fight her cancer for so long and deserves to be pain free, I just always wonder what would life have been without her being diagnose. She didn’t deserve all the pain. She didn’t deserve any of this. I miss her every hour, every minute, and every second of the day.",8.0,"['lost', 'mom', 'stage', 'digit', 'cancer', 'everynumber', 'f', 'digit', 'years', 'old', 'on', 'digit', 'lost', 'beautiful', 'strong', 'most', 'amazing', 'lady', 'life', 'battling', 'stage', 'digit', 'colon', 'cancer', 'digit', 'digit', 'years', 'never', 'gave', 'up', 'mean', 'lady', 'fought', 'till', 'last', 'breathe', 'once', 'passed', 'had', 'biggest', 'smile', 'on', 'face', 'I have', 'heard', 'such', 'amazing', 'stories', 'about', 'mom', 'after', 'passed', 'visiting', 'loved', 'number', 'dreams', 'famrel', 'law', 'nephews', 'visits', 'all', 'time', 'because', 'could', 'see', 'spirts', 'sorry', 'that is', 'weird', 'guys', 'brings', 'so', 'much', 'peace', 'god', 'works', 'mysterious', 'ways', 'blessed', 'I am', 'extremely', 'grateful', 'able', 'spend', 'last', 'digit', 'days', 'hospital', 'along', 'famrels', 'famrel', 'it is', 'most', 'scariest', 'moment', 'life', 'breaks', 'heart', 'will not', 'famrelly', 'love', 'mom', 'gave', 'anymore', 'I am', 'only', 'digit', 'years', 'old', 'can not', 'even', 'imagine', 'life', 'without', 'digit', 'years', 'now', 'there is', 'days', 'cry', 'there is', 'times', 'where', 'I am', 'trying', 'keep', 'going', 'manage', 'always', 'breakdown', 'after', 'holding', 'feel', 'crazy', 'also', 'do not', 'think', 'I am', 'ready', 'accept', 'mom', 'gnumber', 'seems', 'has not', 'responded', 'messages', 'because', 'she is', 'been', 'busy', 'want', 'back', 'guys', 'it is', 'not', 'same', 'without', 'mom', 'here', 'I have', 'watched', 'mom', 'fight', 'cancer', 'so', 'long', 'deserves', 'pain', 'free', 'just', 'always', 'wonder', 'would', 'life', 'been', 'without', 'being', 'diagnose', 'did not', 'deserve', 'all', 'pain', 'did not', 'deserve', 'any', 'miss', 'every', 'hour', 'every', 'minute', 'every', 'second', 'day']",lost mom stage digit cancer everynumber f digit years old on digit lost beautiful strong most amazing lady life battling stage digit colon cancer digit digit years never gave up mean lady fought till last breathe once passed had biggest smile on face I have heard such amazing stories about mom after passed visiting loved number dreams famrel law nephews visits all time because could see spirts sorry that is weird guys brings so much peace god works mysterious ways blessed I am extremely grateful able spend last digit days hospital along famrels famrel it is most scariest moment life breaks heart will not famrelly love mom gave anymore I am only digit years old can not even imagine life without digit years now there is days cry there is times where I am trying keep going manage always breakdown after holding feel crazy also do not think I am ready accept mom gnumber seems has not responded messages because she is been busy want back guys it is not same without mom here I have watched mom fight cancer so long deserves pain free just always wonder would life been without being diagnose did not deserve all pain did not deserve any miss every hour every minute every second day
270,Mum diagnosed with stage I kidney cancer,"My mum found out by accident while getting a CT scan that she has a tumour on her kidney. She's currently in hospital to remove a tumour on arm and recovering from that, but she will require surgery ASAP to remove her kidney. We're still waiting to find out if the tumour on her arm is benign or malignant. I know I'm luckier than most that her kidney cancer was caught early, but I'm still going through the motions of trying to process what might happen. 

I have comfort in knowing my sister and I are in our 30s and are quite stable, so if it's her time then we are in a good place to accept it. My mum said she doesn't want to go through chemo, and I will support her in any decision she makes. The thing I'm most worried about is her suffering. It's hard enough seeing her in hospital not being her usual active self. My mum loves her job and is expecting to go back to it, so I sure hope she can.

271,Back on the heme onc unit.,"Nearly three years after being declared in remission, I'm back on the all too familiar hematology/oncology unit at my hospital. But this time, it's different. This time, I'm on the other side of the bed. I've come back here to work as a nurse. 

After finishing treatment, I found a new purpose in my life. I went to nursing school with the hopes of someday accepting a job on a heme/onc unit. I never dreamed that I would accept a position right out of nursing school, or that it would be on the same floor where I had been a patient.

272,Feeling very down about my Dad’s cancer.....,"My Dad was diagnosed in December of 2018 with 6 months-2.5 years to live after being diagnosed with basically what they are calling pancreatic cancer. He is in a clinical trial now so at least he’s not getting chemo, but I am really scared. He lives in Texas and I am in Oregon, so I’ve been trying to fly out to be with him as much as possible.

But next week he will be getting another biopsy and cat scan and we will get the results. I’m really emotional cuz my Dad keeps saying that things are going good but his wife is saying that she does not think he is doing good and probably won’t make it another 3 months or so. I hate living so far away but I don’t know what to do. 

I haven’t had to deal with too much death in my family (3 of my grandparents have passed—but no parents or siblings) and I just don’t know what to do. I am so anxious all the time, I cry at work and can’t deal with things and I guess I’m just asking for any helpful tips that anyone might have in going through this. My parents divorced when I was 18 and while my mom has been unbelievable supportive, I still feel at a complete loss and alone.

Every morning, I'm just waking up with such a disdain and anger for people because the ignorance and defiance to science and just selfish carelessness for other peoples' health is just...UGH. 

Living through this pandemic with my dad is super stressful because he's a cancer patient who just went through radiation. He pretty much hasn't left our house since early March and I just want him to be able to go outside or into the public without the added stress. We go on walks around our neighborhood and drives to the beach and stuff to make sure he can at least get out of the house. But...holy fucking shit you guys...seeing literally 1 in 10-20 people wearing a mask and everyone else pretending like NOTHING is going on....it's beyond frustrating.

My therapist said that my anger and frustration is valid, but I just need to know if anyone else feels the same way.

274,My wife may have cancer again.,"A little background. My wife was diagnosed with breast cancer last year. After chemo and a mastectomy, she's doing well. She's still on chemo, but it's not nearly as bad as the chemo before her surgery. Recently, she developed a rash on her new boob. Her doctor first had her use an anti-fungal cream, then antibiotics. When neither worked, her doctor took a biopsy. My wife was told it could be an unrelated cancer. That was today. I'm sitting here at work and it's all I can think about. It's all I can do to not burst into tears. I'm so fucking scared. I don't want her to go through all that again. I don't know what I want out of this post, I thought maybe getting it out would make me feel better... I dunno.

Update: Thanks for the kind words. We got the results back. Her cancer has returned. It's treatable, but very aggressive. She starts radiation therapy very soon.

276,Best news we could get,I posted a few weeks ago about my wife’s diagnosis with cervical cancer and wanted to give an update. After a second biopsy and PET scan we got confirmation that she’s stage 1 non metastasized cervical cancer.

279,I have a dilemma 😬,"Hey everyone! I’m new to this page. My name is Maddie, I’m 24 years old, and I live in New Jersey, USA. About 2 weeks ago, my Dad got diagnosed with colon cancer that spread to his liver (I’m not sure what stage yet, my parents are going to the hospital tomorrow) and I’m currently in nursing school. I’ve been having a bit of a hard time recently (obviously) and didn’t do so well on an exam I took yesterday. My professor told us all to meet with her, so I met with her after class yesterday. She told me that because I didn’t do so well on my exam yesterday, I should withdraw from the semester. I started crying (more like sobbing 😭) and told her what’s been happening at home because I just felt very stressed in the moment, and she said again to withdraw. She also said that I “am not going to be emotionally able to pass the class and next semester.” 
I get extended time on exams and such, so I am going to go and talk to my counselor tomorrow morning about what options I have going forward to see if I could medically withdraw or somehow just audit the class. I feel like I should continue, but I’m just really worried because of all the stress from both school and home life. I am really hoping they see my circumstances are extreme, and they can at least do *something* for me. I can still do a regular withdraw, but I want to see what my counselor says before I do anything.

280,Here we go again.......,"The first was in 09.  Testicular.  Left side orchiectomy.  Observation rather than chemo.  Same chances of recurrences with or without chemo..

2nd time on 2010.  Now it is in some lymph nodes around the kidneys.  3 rounds BEP(?) and we are done.  

3rd times is a charm.......Flash forward to 2 months ago.  Head and neck pain take me to Kaiser ED.  Head and neck CT leads to Head and Neck MRI which gives us a diagnosis of lesion on right shoulder affecting hypoglossal nerve.  

Given history of cancer, my Dr orders a PET scan.  I light up like a Christmas tree.  Bone lesions on right clavicle, left humerus, T-12 vertebra, the top bone of my neck, and the retro peritoneal lymph nodes that surround my aorta and vena cava.

Now we are off to the races.  Is this a recurrence of my original cancer or is this a new one?  If it is a recurrence then it is easier to treat and more responsive to chemo.  If it is an all new type, then we have a new set of rules.


I just had a biopsy this past Thursday and am awaiting results.

283,"My wife (34) is near the end, what to talk about?","My wife and I have been together 14 years. We has been through 3 years of surgery, chemo and radiation and she was discharged from the hospital a few months ago entering hospice care for her final days. On discharge the hospital expected she had a few days to a couple of weeks. That was 3 months ago. 

When we had “one more day”, what to say and do came easier. When we have had 100 “last days”, we have been running out of what to say and do to comfort her. 

We were filling our days with car rides and visiting museums, etc. We have reminisced and taken pictures. Coronavirus has removed our options for going out. Now we are watching filler TV, doing some puzzles and otherwise hanging out. But I have run out of things to say and she has lost interest in the mundane activities we have around the house under quarantine. 

We are not religious; we both believe in oblivion after death. There is no comfort for her regarding an afterlife. There is some anxiety about not having a future, though. 

I have never been the kind of person to say nonsense like “it will all be ok” - and my wife doesn’t take comfort in those kinds of empty things anyway. We have said “I love you” so much that it has lost its meaning, sort of. Not lost it’s meaning, it just goes without saying - it’s not as much comfort in these last days.

We don’t talk about my future. I’ll be “ok” and she knows it and I’m not worried about that. I don’t feel comfortable talking about the future and she doesn’t bring it up either. I have tried to comfort her in talking about how much she has meant to me and all of the things that I love about her, but that sort of stuff is not much of a comfort to someone facing death. 

Each day she wakes up I’m thrilled, but I know it means a day of suffering for her. She’s not lucid some days, semi-present other days.

284,Scariest moments of my life.,"Stage 3b cervical cancer here. Had/having an absolutely terrifying experience and just had to share it somewhere. 

This is a long story.

I've been hemorrhaging lately, but it always seems to stop itself. Until recently. Earlier this week I got my first transfusion and thought ""whoo boy this was bad"". I was wrong. That wasn't even close.

This time... this hemorrhage... it was different. I've never called 911 before yesterday but I knew I couldn't wait. I couldn't stand and the world was disappearing before my eyes.

I got very scared, and the emts repeatedly asked if I could walk, and if my hubs could drive me. That made my hubs very angry as I was seriously ill. ""But your vitals are fine!"" they said. Not for long assholes.

They walked me down our large flight of steps, one on each side carrying me. I reach the landing, lose consciousness and vomit on myself before regaining consciousness. I have never fainted before. 

By the time I made it into the rig, my vitals had already begun to drop. They told me I was so pale my skin was transparent. For reasons unbeknownst to me, mr ball leg decided to begin hurting more than I've ever experienced. Great timing asshole. 

I have never been closer to death than during that ambulance ride. I could barely stay awake and couldn't even lift my damn arms or head. I honestly thought ""This is it. I'm gonna die next to an asshole emt that didn't even believe me."" Luckily that was not the case. 

I received emergency blood (2 units) and dilaudid. I finally started to feel human again. But of course the hemorrhage was still occurring. 

After staying in this er for 7-9 hours I got transferred to the better equipped hospital and received an emergency cauterization surgery as well as some sort of liquid adhesive. The bleeding is finally under control for now and I'm receiving 3 more units of blood. My veins are all shot and have only 2 good ivs in all the attempts. My arms look like bruised pin cushions. One had to be given under general during surgery. 

I just want to reach a point in my radiation where the bleeding is finally under control. I fear I'll never get there. I apologize, I'm in a dark place today.

286,"Little brother may be facing lymphoma, am I being over dramatic?","Hello everyone,

So my brother(12)  has been talking about a weird bump in his armpit. At first my parents and I throughly that maybe it was an ingrown hair that he was talking about. He’s a young boy and he’s about to go through puberty so we thought it was normal at first. However, the next day or so he had mentioned that it was “growing” so my dad checked it out and found out that it wasn’t an ingrown hair. It was much larger. 

The day after thanksgiving my parents took him to the hospital to get it checked out. The doctors looked at it and said that they were concerned. They found out that it was three swollen lymph nodes that were causing the bump. So they ran a few tests to see if maybe it was an infection that none of us had known about. The results came back and there was no sign of infection nor trauma. 

They said that they wanted to schedule an appointment with his doctor to run more tests. It’s currently Monday and in the two days since the hospital trip the bump has grown tremendously. It’s now reaching his back and we are very concerned. He said that it is beginning to hurt more. Each day it seems as if it’s been rapidly getting worse. 

My father and I don’t want to say anything because we do not want to scare my mother and little brothers. However, we are concerned about him having lymphoma. We have quite a bit of family history dealing with cancer so this doesn’t really paint a calming picture for us.

I’m 16 so to be honest I really have no idea what to do. It’s not certain that he has lymphoma but it’s a real possibility and don’t even know how to process that. I love that kid more than anything in this world and I’m scared for him. I’m scared of what he’s going through and the possibility of what he could possibly have to go though. I don’t know, I feel like I’m over reacting. I’m just scared and really upset about it. I truthfully want to cry because I don’t want anything to happen to the kid. I’ve always been very protective of my little brother but this isn’t something I can protect him from. I can’t take the hit for him this time and I hate it. We have always been very close. My family and I are trying our very best to stay positive and hope for a good outcome right now. 

I have a lot going on as of now, especially with school. Exams are 16 days away and I have a lot of school work to stay on top of. I just feel very overwhelmed and all I can think about is if my little brother will be okay. How can I make his day better today and how can I try to make things better.

288,My dad died on my shoulder last night,"We found out he had stage IV lung cancer 4 months ago, and it was too agressive ever since. 

We fought against it with everything we had, but in the end we lost the battle, but in a quiet and peaceful way. He's been delusional and asleep for the last 3 days, and at one moment his breathing has gotten slower at which we knew what was going on.

I held his head on my shoulder and told him to fight it and how much I loved him, and in a second his face turned sour and a horrible smell and sound spread through the room, then - he smiled and his head fell against mine.

289,I had my last round of chemo today. And I have no idea what to do now or how to feel.....,"I’m 14. I had my (hopefully) last ever round of chemo. I don’t know what to do. 

This has been my life for the last 2 1/2 years. I know a lot of you have it worse. And I wanna a lot worse, so, I just want you to know, I dont want to complain or seem like I am boasting. 

I had my last vincristine today, and I just have tablets until 3rd July. I officially go into remission 4th July.

I don’t know how to feel. On one hand, it’s a relief. I have finally stopped and I can go back to normal. But on the other hand, I’m scared. I’m scared that my leukaemia will relapse. I’m scared to have my bone marrow test and portacath removal surgery. 

I’m scared that my friends I have made since I was diagnosed will leave me. I feel like they were only friends out of sympathy. They tell me that’s stupid, but I really think that. 

I’m nervous to go back to  school full time, after 2 1/2 years out of school.

I’m frustrated that it has robbed my life.

I’m guilty for surviving this, when my friend didn’t survive (he was 13. Rest his soul).

I’m annoyed that I’m covered in scars.

I’m upset that I have gained 20lbs since starting treatment. I look fat now.

I’m annoyed at how the medications made me ugly (chubby face, gained weight, chemo spots, rashes,etc) 

I’m annoyed at how it’s changed me.

I’m annoyed that it has stolen my teenage years, and will rob the rest of them as I have been forced to grow up. 

As well as this, I don’t know what to do with my life. I mean, I get to start going to my drama group soon, swimming club, school. But I don’t know what to do in between now and when I’m back in those groups. Like, what do i do?

Im sorry if this is seen as boasty/gloating for the fact I have beat cancer.

290,My partners cancer is back and he doesn’t know it yet.,"My partner has stage 3c testicular cancer. 95% curable, but his is now terminal. He’s 30 years old. He has a rare form called Choriocarcinoma. Abdomen, lungs, liver, spine and brain all effected. 


He went through his first chemo regiment March- May 2019. It started out rough, in the ICU coughing up blood. But, the next three rounds he really bounced back. His tumor marker kept dropping, his tumors shrinking. We were thrilled


Getting ready for surgery in July, to remove residue masses. Then, seizure. He relapsed in the brain.


We leave our jobs, both self employed business owners. To move to NYC so he can get high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant at MSK.
It was so hard, but he did it, we did it. August -October 


He gets his surgeries, November - December, no live cancer found. He gets a PET scan, no cancer found. We are so certain he made it through.


Fast forward to now. 10months since his last chemo. His tumor marker skyrocketed. July it was 0, last Thursday 14,900. 


He didn’t want to look at the report, he wanted to wait till we talked to the oncologist. But, I had to look. It’s been 4 days that I’ve known and he hasn’t. We were told a relapse would mean no more cure, just trying to extend life.


His hip has been bothering him, keeping him up at night. He stretches all the time, calling it muscle pain. I know what it is. It’s a tumor in his pelvis. 


Everyday this fast growing cancer is getting worse. It’s been the weekend, then today a holiday so his oncologist office is closed. I can’t tell him but I’m worried he won’t get the palliative chemo in time. I’m worried he won’t even take it once he finds out.


I don’t want to watch the love of my life die at 30.

She lives about 2.5 hrs away, and I haven't been there for any of the doctors appointments, just know what my mom has been relaying me. The doctors have her 6 months tops without chemo, and 10-12 with chemo. I don't believe she plans on doing chemo due to the short window it gives, and it will probably make her sick. I'm struggling emotionally, as is everyone because this came out of nowhere about 3 weeks ago. That's not what this post is about though, I'm looking for advice on what to do for her to make sure everything gets taken care of before she dies.

295,My mom passed away on Friday. Flying back home to an empty apartment has been the hardest part.,"My mom died very suddenly from lung cancer. It had been undiagnosed for a few months and was too aggressive to treat, so we opted to pursue hospice care instead.

I had to fly from another coast to see her before she passed. By then she could no longer speak and only occasionally opened her eyes, as if to acknowledge that she knew we were with her. She looked older and more mortal than I'd ever seen her.

Then, just two days later, she was gone. Two weeks after her diagnosis, she was gone - just like that.

It happened too fast to even comprehend that my mom had just died at 60. I kept myself busy by planning a memorial ceremony for the weekend and talking to relatives I hadn't seen in years. I felt useful again; I could forget about the powerlessness and the death and the gaping hole where my mother had been.

Being surrounded by people gave me a purpose - a reason to focus on something or someone else. Tonight, I flew back home and returned to my apartment, empty except for myself, for the first time.

296,How am I supposed to feel...,"I've had so much crap to deal with lately. Dad has cancer and isn't accepting medical treatment but is doing natural medicine.

I didn't have much of a relationship with him and my siblings.. my mum kept me away and fed me crap about him. Said he didn't care or want to see me. Meanwhile we moved 85 times in my first 20 years, so he most often didn't know my location. I have no idea how long I have left to establish a relationship and 'make up for lost time' or at least create some new memories full of love. We talked and he apologised and I truly forgave

 I think I'm fine with it, but I've had to put dealing with it in a queue.. 

I've had my very ill Grandmother in hospital for 2 weeks, I was with her 40 hours last week through admission through to procedures and complications and ""recovery"" aka doctors had to make the call to send her home as it was as good as it will get (her heart, lungs, bowel, bladder, kidney, liver). 

My aunt had heart surgery and us taking a while to recover.. I'm still worried about her.

My mum has chosen this shitty time to cut me off.... she is a narcissistic so and so. 

I supported my bestie through a court case.. it was traumatic. Now she is staying with me and we are letting loose...Yes I am quite drunk right now. But speaking the truth.

Advice and supportive comments will be happily accepted. I don't know how to begin to process I'm going to lose my dad and I'm yet to build a real relationship with him.

297,Mother just passed of cancer 3 days ago,"My mother started getting sick in June 2019 but her insurance wasn't the best so she held off thinking it wasn't that big a deal until her insurance upgraded in January, she started with a regular dr who couldn't figure out why she had pain in just about all the right side of her body, and a lump on her neck. Eventually the dr sent her to a cancer specialist who told us almost immediately that it was probably cancer but we needed to figure out what type, that was on valentines day. Since they figured out she had stage four non small cell lung cancer. Immediately they started radiation then chemo. The chemo tore her up horribly, then when I took her to her Dr for blood work one day they said her blood pressure and white blood count were way too low so they sent her to the er. The er saw that her heart was arhythmic so they started trying to treat her. Within two days she had several mini strokes, which as it turns out was from clots going to her brain, with the chemo messing her up so bad they couldn't give her much blood thinner so the situation got worse fast. They were set to send her home on palliative care when she suddenly passed away. 

I myself have had 3 surgeries this year one planned the other two not so much. I was in the middle of recovering from back to back surgery when she went into the hospital, was struggling because our stimulus still hadn't came and I've been our of work with no pay for over a month. All of the stress and emotions from this are piling on me a bit, I had already lost my father when I was 21 to staff infection from diabetic complications so its very hard. Add in one of my sisters going to face book and causing drama about how much she loved mom and make up stuff about no one allowing her to make decisions when for most of her adult life she treated my mom like a doormat, made her cry, and barely ever came to see her.

299,About telling my friends of my mom's situation,"So... my and my little sister were told today by my mom (who has been battleing since 2017) that the illness has not been reduced enough. The doctor said it's gonna be useless to continue treatment by this point, so it's only matter of time that she will pass away. It hurts a lot. We don't know if it's gonna be months, a year or more. But we know that it is inevitable.

My question is: How do I tell my friends and loved ones about this?? I feel I should, but I don't know how. And with qurantine still going on in my country for a long time I think I'll only be only to tell them by videocall, but I don't know if it's gonna be the best, cause they can't contain me and it's gonna be awkward to start to cry in front of them alone in my room while they stare in the camera. But I think it well help me a lot if they know.
So, what should I do? I know you don't have much context and each situation is different, but leaving tips or your own experiences with it will  help

300,Supporting a close family member undergoing chemo in a different country,"Hi all, my godmother got diagnosed with colon cancer and started chemo 3 weeks ago. She is currently in my home country (Peru) and I am in the US. She has had one IV session followed by 2 weeks of pills and one week of everything. On the week without any pills, she started feeling really bad, getting extra tired, and with a lot of fatigue. I know that those are side effects of the treatment and recognize that she's not on the best moment for me to be calling her over and over again, so I wanted to ask if there's something that I can do from a distance to let her know that I am there for her without her having to do anything specifically.

My husband, mom and sister don’t let me cry, they say I have to be strong, have faith and be positive.

Last Sunday I went to the hospital and almost don’t made it, after 4 days I at home feeling good and lucky.

We went to eat to my grandma’s house today,  and she started telling how lucky I am, to be grateful because I have all my life ahead of me; I burst in tears in front of everyone, my husband grabbed my hand and told me to breath and tried to calm me.

My mother came to hug me and smile awkwardly saying that I got emotional and to stop crying and whispered at my ear to “stop crying, you’re going to scare grandma”. My grandma tried to calm me down saying more positive stuff.

I felt so conflicted with my emotions, they said it’s as hard for them as it is for me and that I HAVE to be strong for them, but is it?

305,My mom is dying.,"My mom was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer back in June of 2018. It had spread to her liver and lymph nodes. They gave her 3-6 months to live. 

It was devastating news. My mom is my best friend, we are so incredibly close. But she didn’t give up, she fought. She did multiple rounds of chemo and radiation. It shrunk the cancer, it gave us all hope. In January of 2019 she had her first operation on her liver. They had successfully removed 90-95% of the cancer. 

They let her heal, then brought her in to laser away the rest on her liver sometime a few months later. 

Then in October of 2019 they operated on her colon, removing a good portion of her colon. Leaving her with a stoma. 
This was the toughest part for her to get use to. She hated it, even so we all were stupidly hopeful. We thought she had beat it, we really fucking did— or at least I did.

They sent her home to heal. She began having issues with her kidneys, which they eventually attached a bag to it to drain it. During all of this she was going in for tests and ct-scans, again, I was hopefully. 

December 23rd the doctor calls, they tell us it’s returned... worse than it was before. They said she could begin chemo in the new year to extend her life the best they could. 

I was in denial, I refused to believe she couldn’t beat this. I kept insisting that once she starts chemo she will beat it. 

Once mid January came around, my mom broke the news to me. That she is not going to do chemo. 

Now I’m in an absolute state of despair. I feel as though I’m drowning. I’m lost.

309,"After A 13 Month Fight, Cancer Stole My Mother From Me This Morning","35 rounds of radiation… I can’t even tell you the amount of Grays ... and seven rounds of chemo. 
Regression we beat it - then 40 days later, over a July 4th weekend barbecue, she said she felt some discomfort in the same area as before. The cancer was back and growing at twice the rate. Highly aggressive. Like it knew we tried to kill it and wanted revenge. 

We tried three rounds of immunotherapy. No response. Fuck it, we knew that was a longshot anyway. She didn’t have the right genetic marker that showed the best clinical success with that particular drug. In a few weeks time the mass on the back of her tongue grew so large it was robbing her of the ability to swallow or even talk. 
She had to have a gastric feeding tube put in. 
The dietician set her caloric requirements target to 2,500 cal/day + 100 grams of protein. 
This is what an athlete fueling up for a game day probably consumes - but this was a daily target. 

What solid food she could ingest had to be blended down into a purée. Have you ever seen someone attempt to enjoy puréed steak or chicken?  Astronaut food paste. It sucks.  

In late November we moved on to a new dual compound drug. Five rounds of a more aggressive chemotherapy. The compound began to work effectively and quite noticeably by the third session. The tumor shrank. Her CT scans came back with increasingly positive news. 

Her liveliness and desire to go out and do activities, although limited, returned. We went to the movies - Knives Out. Her appetite returned. Things were on the upswing. 

I was getting my mother back and not this hollow shell of an entity that used to represent my mother  occupying the spare bedroom in my house ... the one that now doubled as a medical center.


It’s like the cancer knew we were winning again and so it decided to employ a new trick to fuck us over - it waited for a blood infection to strike. She felt a little wheezy on Friday. They gave her a strong dose of antibiotic drip during the chemo session. 

Saturday she felt a little better. Sunday, not so well. Sunday night diarrhea. Monday, wouldn’t leave the room but largely responsive. By Tuesday she was deep in the throws of septic shock. Unable to fight off the illness, she died early this morning. 

I was with her in her waning hours. She looked at me and called me “Mom” although I’m her son. Her speech was garbled and unintelligible. I gave her a pad and pen so she could hopefully communicate with me - all she wrote was “Home”. Over and over and over. Each letter deteriorating in repetition. 

https://imgur.com/QVJ2wbL

She was Lifeflighted to a pre-eminent medical facility. The medical staff did everything they could for her but the level of toxicity in her blood was simply too great. Seven hours later her soul joined the ever after. 

I am not a particularly violent person. I’m violent only when need necessitates.

310,My mum sadly passed away on the 22nd December 2018.,"Her funeral is in 5 days and everything is just going too fast. I’ve been sorting out the funeral arrangements and the council came round my mums house yesterday and said we have 3 weeks to sort her things out and be gone; suggesting that my brother and I present at homeless so we can get on the housing list (I am 26years old, my brother is 29). I asked what this involved and she told me that we would be out in temporary accommodation- no thanks. I’ve just lost my mum, had the worst Christmas and new year of my life and my mental health is seriously deteriorating and they expect us to go homeless?? 
The fact they’ve only given me 3 weeks to sort through my mums house which only gives me 2 weeks after the funeral to completely empty it ready for the next person. 
I haven’t even fully sorted the funeral out as my mum didn’t have insurance and it’s all been left to me to do. I keep feeling like I’m making huge mistakes all the time and I just want everything to be perfect.
My brothers aren’t of much help practically- my older brother who is 29 has autism and I’m his carer. My younger brother who is 24 has his own life 150 miles away (we are all really close and I wouldn’t dis my younger brother- he is going through a lot right now and is struggling and still needs to work).  I am blessed with good brothers who I consider my best friends, just we are all good at our own thing.

315,Dad (60) is slowly fading. I’m not sure how to process my grief.,"It’s been a long year and a half since my dad was diagnosed with rectal cancer. At first we were all upbeat and confident that he was going to beat it. But about 2 months ago that all changed.

Forgive me for not knowing the technical term, but he developed a blood clot of some sort due to his chemo port. That’s when the Dr’s all conferred and told us there was really nothing they could do at this point, besides pain management. 

We prayed and prayed, and hoped for a miracle. But that miracle didn’t come. It’s been almost 2 years of slowly losing hope, and realizing that we were all powerless in a hopeless situation. 

So this week I flew home and am spending my days by his bed side, having normal conversations with him about sports, trucks, even plumbing... and he’s all there. He’s a bit loopy from the meds, but he’s there. 

It sucks. Because I know he won’t be there soon. Like at all. And I don’t know how to process the pain. It’s painful to wait. It’s painful to know what’s coming. And it’s painful to think of what it’s going to be like when he’s gone. What am I going to tell my kids when their grandpa isn’t here anymore?

318,They are removing breathing tube out on Sunday,"My beloved boyfriend (35m) has been fighting for brain cancer (recurrent anaplstic glioma) since 2012, been through multiples surgeries, radition and chemo therapies. It kept regrowing, he defeated it and it grew back again.  and this time it spreaded so quick that we are still in shock. It's happening. He started to be really weak and detoriate since xmas and i was not able to care for him at home anymore in terms of physical support, so we admitted him in on sunday. He was still alright, not at his best until wednesday when he complained of massive headaches. He vomitted twice during the night. In the morning, I tried to wake him up for his daily medication, he was only able to open his eyes to see me 1nlast time and went back to deep sleep.  He became unresponsive on thursday, was brought down to ICU. Doctors suspected it was either internal bleeding or the tumour surpressing on the nerve. He registered to be organ donor so they are in process of finalising it and will romove the tubes out on sunday.

I thought I'd prepared for this, and that I wouldnt be too bad but it's really hard to see him with breathing tubes and all other tubes around him. And he doesnt respond to me but he looks so peaceful in his sleep. We talk to him a lot hopong he could hear us. I'm glad that his massive group of friends get to come and say goodbye to him for the last time. 

I'm just really dissapointed that it happened so quick that we didn't have chance to do all the videos he wished to have in his funeral. And at some point on wednesday, I was out to some appointment, his mind wasnt right and did not make alot of senses, he thought that I neglected him and did not need him anymore. I love him so much and I'd never ever leave him. I really hope in his last moment he did not think it that way.... there are so many 'I should have done this or I should have not done that' thought running through in my brain and I just cant ignore those thoughts. We onlg have 1 day left together and I try not to think too much about it and spend quality time with him but it's just hard. Guess I wanna try venting them all in here so I might feel abit better.

319,My son’s tumors have continued to shrink!,"My son is 12 with GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme- second recurrence). His tumors shrank by about half from March to May, and they’ve continued to shrink from May to July! He’s currently on a study, and the oncologist says he can stay on it for up to 2 years (as long as nothing goes wrong and things continue to shrink).

Since he’s been on steroids heavily, when he complained of his back hurting they ordered some X-Rays. He has a fracture in one of his vertebrae, so now he’s going for a full body bone density scan in a few days and we’ll meet with some of his oncology team members.

Does anyone have experience with Gabapentin or Calcitonin (They want to start Calcitonin to strengthen his bones, Gabapentin for pain management- although he refuses to even take Tylenol for pain.) I’ve researched some already, just interested in real world experiences with either of these meds. 

I also had a picture of scan differences, but was unsure if I should post it.

321,"how to stay positive and peaceful, quarantined in 560sq ft w emotionally volatile stage 4 mom","tips on living in close quarters while feeling depressed and constantly on call w mom? she is kind of ocd, has many rules, gets upset easily--feels pain physiologically in her cancer areas when upset, and gets stressed and loud easily...i try to be peaceful most of the time, sometimes i erupt. we dont have that much private space and i feel my only private time is when im sleeping. idk. this all feels stupid. its hard dealing with her depression and mine. i try to be uplifting but she talks about death daily and we have semi-separate rooms, but not really. we are kind of in one brain. since its almost like being in the same room daily. she complains about not having enough to eat. our fridge is often stocked full...i go out to buy groceries often....anyway. i guess it would be good to be out of the house a few hours of the day. i feel depressed when i go outside because i feel unsafe in my depression around strangers, just walking around the neighborhood...

i bring her to chemo appointments. set up everything. insurance. doctors. lawyers. driving. groceries. etc...so i feel exhausted. i havent left my bed in maybe 3 days very much. depression is rubbing off on each other.

tips appreciated.  ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. she just told me to get out of the house if i keep acting like this (depressed), that she doesnt want me here, i guess out of kindness and upset-ness. that shell just take care of herself. that she will kick me out. i mean its important for her not to get upset, as it flares her pain, but she gets upset rather easily. i try to just follow her rules. but its so many rules. lol. our language barrier brings frustrations too. so even communicating can be stressful. there are no other caregivers. i have no where to go except my dad's. my mom gets lonely and depressed if left by herself too long. she cant handle appointments and doesnt even drive at this point because it has always stressed her out. i cant just leave her. it just doesnt make sense.

i get the sense that her issues w anger probably caused her cancer, to some extent...actually it makes a lot of sense...maybe. if her flare ups caused gastro-intestinal issues, and it happened often, it could have been the start of chronic infection related to gallbladder cancer...

feels really sad:(...................................

just need to figure out how to have self-care time while living in close quarters...i dont want to take emotional beatings, not say anything, and feel resentful, have anger bubble up. at the same time, dont want to piss her off too much by addressing it either without ability to just let it go myself. lol. seems kinda hard to do neither.",3.0,"['how', 'stay', 'positive', 'peaceful',

326,My mom can’t eat...,"My mom is 72 and has Stage 4 Stomach Cancer that has spread to her liver, pancreas, and spleen.

She just finished her first round of oral chemo (5days ago) and it was really rough on her. She hasn’t been able to eat anything or drink anything in the past five days. She is going to the hospital to do a daily IV drop with Potassium, Salts, Sugars and AntiNausea, also taking Anti Nausea, but can’t seem to keep any liquid down that is thicker than water. Even water is trouble sometimes and most often it will get out of her system one way or another.

The thought of food or anything like broth makes her gag and she has a fear of throwing up. I just don’t know what to do. They will admit her if she can’t eat. 

We are trying THC gummies on Friday as she is able to keep gummies down.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

327,Mother passed away from Lung Cancer today.,"My mom had been struggling these past few days. I spent a lot of my time trying to make sure she was comfortable. Giving her meds hourly and communicating with hospice about how to deal with the hard parts like anxiety attacks, catheters, and getting her to take her meds. Eventually I was able to make her comfortable and I laid with her today while she was knocked out from the metastasis in her brain and a cocktail of really strong medicine, and I told her that I loved her and she didn’t have to hang on anymore and then she passed just seconds later. I’m sad. It’s weird seeing all of her stuff here but she isn’t. It’s weird knowing that this is final. It’s tough but I’ll have to make it. Hopefully she knows how sorry I am and how much I love her.

328,My dad isn’t suffering anymore,"My dad passed away last night at around 11:15. He really wanted to come home from the hospital. I think he knew he was going to pass away and wanted to die at his house. He was only at his house 1 day and passed away. He only suffered for a few hours but he was never left alone. He wasn’t responsive but we knew he could hear us. He talked to him a lot and reminded him of how much we love him and that we will be ok. 

They took his body at around 3am. I miss him and sometimes forget he isn’t with us and then i remember. I feel I’m one of the most affected bc I really tried to do everything to save him. He had me make some decisions for him. Now we have to plan the viewing and service. He wants to be cremated. I feel angry at cancer, it’s so selfish. I know it died along with my dad. I wish it wasn’t necessary for my dad to pass away in order for the cancer to disappear. 

I want to say so much more but I just feel like crying but I’m surrounded by people and we are all coping differently. They are able to laugh more and joke around. I can do it for a short period of time. But I remember.

329,My mother and cancer,"Hey guys, 
I’m currently 17 and live in a household with around 10-30k income a year(not really sure but I live in a trailer). My family has started a company here doing oilfield work. My mom has been doing a great job with it. However, for the past few years, she’s been dealing with some type of ovarian and uterean cancer. She’s in pain a lot of the day and is held down by being on oxygen. We can’t afford to see the doctor or get surgery for her since we don’t have enough money or insurance. She gets frustrated a lot of the time and says self-harm things about how she doesn’t want to live with the pain. We all hate seeing her like this, and it isn’t her. As a mom, she works both our business and at the local auto body shop. However, she has to work from home and cannot leave the house because she is on oxygen. She has not been able to attend my last few years of school  jazz concerts or awards. I really just want my mom back guys.",1.0,"['famrel', 'cancer', 'hey', 'guys', 'I am', 'currently', 'digit', 'live', 'household', 'around', 'digitk', 'income', 'yearnot', 'sure', 'live', 'trailer', 'family', 'has', 'started', 'company', 'here', 'doing', 'oilfield', 'work', 'mom', 'has', 'been', 'doing', 'great', 'job', 'however', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'she is', 'been', 'dealing', 'some', 'type', 'ovarian', 'uterean', 'cancer', 'she is', 'pain', 'lot', 'day', 'held', 'down', 'being', 'on', 'oxygen', 'can not', 'afford', 'see', 'doctor', 'get', 'surgery', 'since', 'do not', 'enough', 'mnumbery', 'insurance', 'gets', 'frustrated', 'lot', 'time', 'says', 'selfharm', 'things', 'about', 'how', 'does not', 'want', 'live', 'pain', 'all', 'hate', 'seeing', 'like', 'is not', 'mom', 'works', 'both', 'business', 'local', 'auto', 'body', 'shop', 'however', 'has', 'work', 'home', 'cannot', 'leave', 'house', 'because', 'on', 'oxygen', 'has', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'atnumberd', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'school', 'jazz', 'concerts', 'awards', 'just', 'want', 'mom', 'back', 'guys']",famrel cancer hey guys I am currently digit live household around digitk income yearnot sure live trailer family has started company here doing oilfield work mom has been doing great job however past few years she is been dealing some type ovarian uterean cancer she is pain lot day held down being on oxygen can not afford see doctor get surgery since do not enough mnumbery insurance gets frustrated lot time says selfharm things about how does not want live pain all hate seeing like is not mom works both business local auto body shop however has work home cannot leave house because on oxygen has not been able atnumberd last few years school jazz concerts awards just want mom back guys
330,A memorial to a fellow Redditor and how much this subreddit means to all of us,"When I first joined this subreddit I didn’t know what to expect. I wanted a place to go to speak to other people who are going through cancer treatment and the stand alone forums and all the websites like American cancer society just had too scary of statistics to manage 

The internet is a very scary place, you never know who you will encounter and how they will react to you asking for emotional support. People on the internet aren’t as nice as your friends and families who know you. But sometimes you get lucky. 

My first post here was to ask anyone else if they had the same cancer as me. I have a very rare cancer and a very subset of that cancer. This women who was 12 years older than me responded and told me to message her anytime. 

From May to August through the up and downs of treatments, deciding which chemo to pick, waiting for scan results, etc she helped me. We were complete opposites she was married with kids living in the a small city in the south and I am younger single living in New York. She Always spoke about how we effect others when we go through treatment and how our job is not only to change our outlook on life but also theirs. She’s been fighting for 3 years and she taught me to normalize it. She went to part time work when she can if even she was tired and tried to travel. She cared for her son deeply. Even after chemos and radiation’s she would be so tired she made it a daily effort to go outside and play with her son. 

In July I received terrible news that my disease has spread to my lung. At this point I been sick since 21 and I have been in treatment so long I couldn’t battle anymore. I couldn’t find a way to live. If living required another a year of treatment I couldn’t physically do it. I was highly suicidal, not listening to my family or friends and completely babbling psychosis. She was the only person that was able to stop me and talk me from a ledge. She reached out to me after reading one of my posts and was extremely worried about my state of mind. She told me how important I am to my family and to her and how we must continue forward because it is the only way to go, there is no suicidal option. 

This Redditor recently passed away. I’m not sure from what or when but I saw she was posting less I was concerned and checked her last posts and messaged her and she had told me she was in the hospital for the last 8 weeks for an infection. 

Out of respect to her and her family I am not putting her name here but she was a special Person of this subreddit. She answered a lot of questions and offered a lot of advice. She was always willing to lend a helping hand, especially when it came to patients who are fighting while raising young kids. 

This is my memorial to her, I thank her for every wisdom she’s given me and I thank this forum for allowing me to meet her. 

Even if you just answer a comment, or answer a dm from a newly diagnosed person who is scared and doesn’t know where to go, you are helping someone. You mean more than you think. 

We are all fighting this disease together, in our own way but there are rarities in the connections that we make where we can make it a little easier to mood forward. 

May this Redditor rest easy and may you all be healthy in the new year

Her breast cancer diagnosis was April 17 of this year, and all you survivors and fighters out there know the deal. July 25th we survived her mastectomy, and even though chemo ends today, the fight will continue into the new year with radiation and hormone therapy. 

My wife is a rock, and when she's feeling healthy, she loves getting on cancer forums and supporting others. I'll be returning to work next week after caregiving for the last 6 months. 

The fine doctors, nurses, chemists, and volunteers at the BC Cancer Center in Victoria have been so crucial to our journey. Thank you.

333,Looking for some words of guidance or hope,"To preface, my mom has terminal stage IV metastatic lung cancer. She has been so brave and strong for all of us (her immediate family) even though we told her it’s OK to “let go.” She is very stubborn, and I know she is fighting her death; I can’t blame her, I’d probably fight it too...But last night she started developing tremendous pain, like nothing we’ve seen before. She was flailing her legs around and wailing things like “help me,” “ow, ow, ow,” etc. Luckily we had some morphine tablets and some Xanax on hand, and hospice recommended we crush up one of each and put it on the inside of her cheek since she couldn’t swallow a pill in that state. It seemed to help. Today they gave us some liquid morphine with a small plastic syringe so it’d be easier for her to take without risk of choking. But I’m worried because she hasn’t eaten anything at all since yesterday, and has barely had any liquids. She has been asleep for the majority of the day. She wakes up for short periods of time (30 seconds up to a couple minutes) usually when she is in pain. She is not very coherent at all, however there have been a few moments where she does make sense. I know she can hear us talking. She told me she loved me earlier, which was great to hear. We talk to her quietly throughout the day and hold her hand. We also have to get her up a little to change her bed pads and diaper. I’m really scared of how the medicine is affecting her on a completely empty stomach. I’m worried the morphine is causing her death to come quicker, but since she cries out in pain and asks us for help, I know she needs it. I hate that she is suffering. It’s soul shattering to know there is so little we can do to help her. I’m just so confused, and part of me wishes it would just end so she can be at peace and stop struggling. Would anyone else be willing to share their story about being with a loved one in their final hours/days? Is this normal what she is going through? I just want her to have a dignified and comfortable death...",3.0,"['looking', 'some', 'words', 'guidance', 'hope', 'preface', 'mom', 'has', 'terminal', 'stage', 'iv', 'metastatic', 'lung', 'cancer', 'has', 'been', 'so', 'brave', 'strong', 'all', 'immediate', 'family', 'even', 'though', 'it is', 'ok', '“let', 'go”', 'stubborn', 'know', 'fighting', 'death', 'can not', 'blame', 'I would', 'probably', 'fight', 'toobut', 'last', 'night', 'started', 'developing', 'tremendous', 'pain', 'like', 'nothing', 'we have', 'seen', 'before', 'flailing', 'legs', 'around', 'wailing', 'things', 'like', '“help', 'me”', '“ow', 'ow', 'ow”', 'etc', 'luckily', 'had', 'some', 'morphine', 'tablets', 'some', 'xanax', 'on', 'hand', 'hospice', 'recommended', 'crush', 'up', 'number', 'each', 'put', 'on', 'inside', 'cheek', 'since', 'could not', 'swallow', 'pill', 'state', 'seemed', 'help', 'today', 'gave', 'some', 'liquid', 'morphine', 'small', 'plastic', 'syringe', 'so', 'it would', 'easier', 'take', 'without', 'risk', 'choking', 'I am', 'worried', 'because', 'has not', 'eanumber', 'anything', 'all', 'since', 'yesterday', 'has', 'barely', 'had', 'any', 'liquids', 'has', 'been', 'asleep', 'majority', 'day', 'wakes', 'up', 'short', 'periods', 'time', 'digit', 'seconds', 'up', 'couple', 'minutes', 'usually', 'when', 'pain', 'not', 'coherent', 'all', 'however', 'there', 'been', 'few', 'moments', 'where', 'does', 'make', 'sense', 'know', 'hear', 'talking', 'loved', 'earlier', 'great', 'hear', 'talk', 'quietly', 'throughout', 'day', 'hold', 'hand', 'also', 'get', 'up', 'little', 'change', 'bed', 'pads', 'diaper', 'I am', 'scared', 'how', 'medicine', 'affecting', 'on', 'completely', 'empty', 'stomach', 'I am', 'worried', 'morphine', 'causing', 'death', 'come', 'quicker', 'since', 'cries', 'out', 'pain', 'asks', 'help', 'know', 'needs', 'hate', 'suffering', 'it is', 'soul', 'shattering', 'know', 'there', 'so', 'little', 'do', 'help', 'I am', 'just', 'so', 'confused', 'part', 'wishes', 'would', 'just', 'end', 'so', 'peace', 'stop', 'struggling', 'would', 'anynumber', 'else', 'willing', 'share', 'story', 'about', 'being', 'loved', 'number', 'final', 'hoursdays', 'normal', 'going', 'through', 'just', 'want', 'dignified', 'comfortable', 'death']",looking some words guidance hope preface mom has terminal stage iv metastatic lung cancer has been so brave strong all immediate family even though it is ok “let go” stubborn know fighting death can not blame I would probably fight toobut last night started developing tremendous pain like nothing we have seen before flailing legs around wailing things like “help me” “ow ow ow” etc luckily had some morphine tablets some xanax on hand hospice recommended crush up number each put on inside cheek since could not swallow pill state seemed help today gave some liquid morphine small plastic syringe so it would easier take without risk choking I am worried because has not eanumber anything all since yesterday has barely had any liquids has been asleep majority day wakes up short periods time digit seconds up couple minutes usually when pain not coherent all however there been few moments where does make sense know hear talking loved earlier great hear talk quietly throughout day hold hand also get up little change bed pads diaper I am scared how medicine affecting on completely empty stomach I am worried morphine causing death come quicker since cries out pain asks help know needs hate suffering it is soul shattering know there so little do help I am just so confused part wishes would just end so peace stop struggling would anynumber else willing share story about being loved number final hoursdays normal going through just want dignified comfortable death
334,My dad bought my mom's casket today.,"I'm not ready for this. I'm never going to be ready for this. I had this thought in my head that when the end arrived, it would be gradual and clear and firm, that years of caring for her would prepare me for it. And it was gradual, for so long, but the problem is that I never recognized it as leading into an end. Part of me came to terms with the reality of losing her, and part of me was totally unwilling to mourn someone while they were still alive. But it's here now, sudden and all at once, and I'm a thousand miles away scrambling to book plane tickets and make arrangements, not knowing if it'll be hours or days or weeks before she's dead.

335,Tough day,"My wife was diagnosed with colon cancer approximately 3 years ago. She had a full colectomy and then an illeostomy. Since then, she has beem readmitted to the hospital due to sepsis and migraines(march of 2016) during which they found a few tumors in both lungs. She started taking immunotherapy shortly therafter.. Recently(july 5th) she was admitted after a mass was found un her cerebellum, but was deemed treatable, and went through 5 sessions of focused radiation, which appears to have been oretty successful. Shortly after that,  she had a bowel obstruction which required surgery. My wife has been on dexamethasone for almost 3 months.  We recently added yervoy to the opdivo she was taking in hopes that it will get to the tumor in her braib, in case the radiation didnt destroy it all.. 
Well, that is the background. I am posting because this has been one of the most difficult days I have had. I was looking at our old photos, and i started to think about how life was before the diagnosis. I have been umpleasant to my family(quiet and grumpy), but i am just angry. Angry at the disease. Angry we did not catch it sooner. Angry i didnt do more.  Angry that she keeps having more problems stacked upon her already thick list of issues.

I am just tired if seeing my love, my best friend, go through hell.

337,It’s been 11 years,"11 years ago i lost one of the most important people in my life to this disease,
I was around 4 years old when she passed,
My mum was a fighter, she fought long and hard but she couldn’t carry on,
myself being 4 didn’t understand what happened,
all i knew was that i would never see her again and that was all that i could understand,
i felt like my childhood was ripped away from me as i grew up trying to figure out why my mum while every other child was playing outside with their families,
as i got older the more i understood and the more pain i felt,
i know i’ll never see her again but i just wish i could of at least said goodbye,
she didn’t deserve this but it’s the good ones who die early in this stupid life,
this past few years have been the worst as i didn’t grieve properly as a kid and it’s all bottled up now,
recently i was diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety,
this was the spark that started all of my mental health issues,
it’s left me thinking everyone will leave me in the end,
i’m only 14 now and i still don’t understand why her 
i love her with my whole being and would do anything to see her again 
i miss you mum forever and always",8.0,"['it is', 'been', 'digit', 'years', 'digit', 'years', 'ago', 'lost', 'number', 'most', 'important', 'people', 'life', 'disease', 'around', 'digit', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'passed', 'famrel', 'fighter', 'fought', 'long', 'hard', 'could not', 'carry', 'on', 'being', 'digit', 'did not', 'understand', 'happened', 'all', 'knew', 'would', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'all', 'could', 'understand', 'felt', 'like', 'childhood', 'ripped', 'away', 'grew', 'up', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'famrel', 'while', 'every', 'other', 'child', 'playing', 'outside', 'families', 'got', 'older', 'more', 'understood', 'more', 'pain', 'felt', 'know', 'I will', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'just', 'wish', 'could', 'least', 'said', 'goodbye', 'did not', 'deserve', 'it is', 'good', 'numbers', 'die', 'early', 'stupid', 'life', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'been', 'worst', 'did not', 'grieve', 'properly', 'kid', 'it is', 'all', 'bottled', 'up', 'now', 'recently', 'diagnosed', 'depression', 'anxiety', 'spark', 'started', 'all', 'mental', 'health', 'issues', 'it is', 'left', 'thinking', 'everynumber', 'will', 'leave', 'end', 'I am', 'only', 'digit', 'now', 'do not', 'understand', 'why', 'love', 'whole', 'being', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'see', 'again', 'miss', 'famrel', 'forever', 'always']",it is been digit years digit years ago lost number most important people life disease around digit years old when passed famrel fighter fought long hard could not carry on being digit did not understand happened all knew would never see again all could understand felt like childhood ripped away grew up trying figure out why famrel while every other child playing outside families got older more understood more pain felt know I will never see again just wish could least said goodbye did not deserve it is good numbers die early stupid life past few years been worst did not grieve properly kid it is all bottled up now recently diagnosed depression anxiety spark started all mental health issues it is left thinking everynumber will leave end I am only digit now do not understand why love whole being would do anything see again miss famrel forever always
338,January 18th,"I’ve known that this was what it was from the first appointment with her oncologist, but I can’t believe she’s gone. Three months from diagnosis to death. 

Cancer took my beautiful, amazing mother. She was 63. She was my best friend. She loved me (her only daughter) but she loved my son more than life itself and was really excited to have a granddaughter on the way. We received the prognosis when I was 6 months pregnant and I wasn’t sure if she was going to even meet her granddaughter. 

After, multiple very long hospital stays and radiation to her brain and stomach, she was put on hospice. I visited her the day she died and I knew it would be the last day. 

Luckily, my daughter was able to meet my mother but now as she’s smiling her first precious sweet toothless baby smiles, I’m left feeling broken-hearted at what she was so so excited for and now she’s just... gone.

342,My mom has been fighting advanced colon cancer for two years but this is the beginning of the end,"So two years ago my mom went to the ER because she wasn’t feeling well. She hadn’t been feeling 100% for a while and one night she was shivering so hard and even with the fireplace going and a million blankets on her she still felt freezing. They found some spots in her liver and eventually determined it was colon cancer that had spread to her liver. Her liver was covered in spots and she had tumors on her colon, mainly one big one.


She began very aggressive treatment but even from the beginning we knew it was very unlikely she would be cure and the main goal of treatment was to give her more good time. This time last year she found a spot on her lung but she opted to not have it biopsied or taken out. What would be the point if she already has cancer? She did chemo treatment on and off and tried some experimental radiation therapy too where they injected little radioactive pellets (I think?) right into her liver. But since the beginning of this year she lost her insurance and isn’t eligible for social security benefits so money has been really tight. She’s just been taking a radiation therapy in pill form. 


Now, last week, she fell outside the chiropractors office. She’d been having pain in her groin and down her leg for a couple months. She figured it was just a muscle thing because she’d been pretty low energy and was just laying in her recliner all day. But after the fall she went to the ER and they found a fracture in her femur. She went into surgery the next day to put a pin in her femur to help strengthen the bone and they found a tumor, likely the cause of the fracture. 


My mom has lived two years with this disease and she has remained so strong. We’ve gone on many trips together and she finally fulfilled her dream of buying a motor home. I helped her drive it cross country back home. She’s so strong and amazing and I can’t believe this is happening. Her goal from the very beginning was to live long enough to see my youngest sibling graduate high school to make sure they’d really be okay. They graduate next month so she’s made it to her goal from the very beginning. With the developments of her cancer she’s not going to do anymore extensive chemo or treatment. I’m not even sure if she’ll still take the pill she’s been taking. She had a blood clot in her leg last year and the doctor gave her the best blood thinner but she doesn’t take it anymore because she has to inject herself every day. I really can’t blame her at all. I get it, she’s tired. I can’t even imagine what chemo feels like but I can see that it really beats her down. I even told her from the beginning that if she didn’t want to do treatment I would understand but she basically said “hell yeah I’m doing treatment! I got shit to do!” 


All her life my mom has served others. She took in kids off the street to help them live better lives. She helped people at church. When I was really young she would take one of our neighbors to her chemo treatments every week and help keep her company. I really can’t remember her taking baths or going to the spa or doing anything for herself but I remember going with her to volunteering events and working at the soup kitchen for the homeless. I’ve been so depressed and I just feel like this is really truly the beginning of the end. It’s not a good outlook once it spreads to the bone and especially if she isn’t doing treatment anymore, I know she’ll be gone very soon. I cried today with my boyfriend then I was okay getting ready for work but once I was alone in my car I started crying again. I went into work and I couldn’t stop crying so my boss pulled me aside and told me I could take the night off and told me to call her if I need more time. I don’t even know why I’m writing this. I just feel so wrecked. I have a really bad headache from crying so hard all day but I hate living my life knowing my mom is dying. She lives 1000 miles away and it’s hard to take time off work because money and also I feel bad. I don’t even know why I feel bad but I do. I work a job that you can’t really pick up the work tomorrow so if I’m gone then everyone is left short staffed. My managers seem to be very kind and understanding about the situation but I also worry about losing my job for taking time off which is silly because it’s not even a big career or anything, it’s just a in a meantime type job. 


I just really feel like my life is crashing. I love my mom, she’s my best friend. Sometimes I don’t call her because I want to forget what’s going on but then I feel bad because I don’t call. I feel like I need to be there for my siblings and check in with them but I always just feel like I’m barely struggling to hold myself down, how can I try to support someone else?

344,My mom passed away this morning,My mom passed away early this morning. It was completely unexpected. I usually sleep in the same room as her but last night I told her i'll sleep upstairs and I'll see her tomorrow morning. She was raising her arm high up (she normally don't even have the energy to even move her hand) continously. My dad took care of her at night until 330am and he went to his room to sleep because she looked comfortable. In the morning at 7am we realised she wasn't breathing anymore. We called the ambulance and they said it seems like she passed away 3 hours ago which was around 4am. I think my mom decided to let go when we weren't around.

345,Lost my twin brother,"I lost my identical twin brother last month to lymphoma at just 29 years old. I was sitting next to him. His head was on my shoulder. One second he was sleeping, the next he was just\- gone. It's been 7 weeks. 7 incredibly long, miserable, horrible weeks. To say I'm not handling it well is an understatement, which I guess is what brought me here. My brother always liked reddit. Said it would made him laugh, or forget about problems. I don't know, I always thought people online were mostly jackasses (no offense to any here) but I guess my brother just always brought out the best in people. He could find the good in everyone, find the joke in anything, zero in on the people he could horse around with and make everything a party. He always had his sense of humor. His reddit name was photonstravellight, if anyone here knew him. I never even had to make my own account, my brother would cherry\-pick the best stuff almost every day and send it to me. Made for a lot of laughs. Gonna have to do that myself now, I guess. Even had to go and make my own reddit account for the very first time, which just seemed surreal. I'm sad, and upset, and angry, and I alternate between wanting to break things and wanting to just sit in the corner and rock myself. My brother didn't deserve this. I'm the asshole, it should have been me. My brother had a future. He was a brilliant physicist. He played a mean fiddle. He was kind, and thoughtful, humble, and genuinely cared about everyone he came in contact with. He was the best person I know. I would gladly take his place. It should have been me. I did 3 tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, I should have been the one to die. Not him. He was by far a better person than I will ever be. At his very core he was a good person. Seeing him struggle through brutal treatments for 2 years and not be able to do a damn thing was a nightmare, but I thought it was a means to an end. I always thought someway, somehow, he would succeed just on sheer stubbornness. And even worse has been to see most of our mutual friends seem like they barely care. They mostly abandoned him when he was diagnosed (including his girlfriend at the time), the very few that stuck around seemed to give up on him in his final few months and mostly stopped talking to him. Then they all pretended like they suddenly cared when he died. And then just carried on with their lives the very next day, like absolutely nothing happened. Like he was just a speed bump in their lives. I always took for granted that having an identical twin meant I'd have a friend, a shoulder to cry on, someone to have my back, someone to play pranks on, (potential organ donor?)\- for my whole life. Now I have to face the next 40\+ years without him. There is not a day that I will not miss him. We were halfway through a bucket list goal of visiting every national park together. I have an unused plane ticket I bought him when we were supposed to go snowboarding last February and I had to cancel because of work. Wish now that I’d told work to kiss my ass and gone anyway. He was supposed to be my best man at my wedding next year. Not in a million years did I think the day would come that I would lose him. His funeral is this weekend, which just promises to reopen all the wounds that haven’t yet closed up. I don’t possess the coping skills for this.

346,Feel like everyone thinks I'm a liar. no support network.,"I am just struggling right now. Friends and family expect too much of me. I had my two best friends leave me after arguing with me about me still being stage 4 and in treatment (yeah, apparently I can't possibly be in treatment anymore because ""it's been too long""). They said some nasty things and I just gave up the relationship since I was there for them through every single struggle in their lives for the past 9 years and they haven't stepped in to support me at all through this. If I tried to talk about what I was going through they would get mad and change the subject. Then, on top of losing the majority of my friends (thanks to the one single person who stuck by me, holy shit I wouldn't be here without her), family is acting like I am lying about how bad things are. The family I live with gets mad at me for sleeping ""Too late"" when they constantly wake me up all night long, they get mad at me because I still can't go up and down the stairs regularly. My grandmother accused me of lying about how bad things are just to make her life miserable. Because someone in their mid 20s totally wants to be living in the main area of the house with no privacy and no way to bathe properly. I just don't understand why everyone is acting so shitty. It's stage 4 cancer and I'm on chemo indefinitely. I can't just make the side effects go away and suddenly feel amazing. If I stay in my ""room"" (curtained off portion of house) for too long I get fussed at, but if I go out to a friends house to hang out I get fussed at. It's like everyone is so upset about me inconveniencing them with my health that they think I'm doing it on purpose. I didn't ask to get cancer. I just wanted to graduate college and move on in life. I don't know what to do anymore. I am so tired of feeling like everyone hates me for this. When I got diagnosed I thought maybe things would get better.. Maybe everyone would stop acting like I was exaggerating how bad the pain was. Instead I got support for the first few months (up until the first surgery) and then after that everyone just acts mad/annoyed that I'm not ""cured"" yet. They act like it's my freaking fault that this cancer is difficult.

347,Surgery in a couple hours,"Chemo has done its job and shrunk most of my mets to the point where they're not visible on a CT scan. The surgeon will remove 1/3 of my liver getting rid of the last visible tumor and burn off any abnormalities from the remaining liver. Theoretically I'll be free from any visible cancer after this. Then 6 weeks of recovery followed by a few rounds of cleanup chemo to get any invisible cancer.

I'm not worried about the surgery as much as the recovery and how much pain there might be. I hope I can get on my feet and back to bird watching ASAP.

349,Day+366 from transplant.,"On Sept. 25th 2019 I received an allogenic stem cell transplant, 33 years to the day from when I was born. In the following weeks I thought it was the worst thing I had ever had to endure. It hasn't been easy but yesterday I celebrated my 34th birthday and the one year anniversary of my transplant. I realize now those cells I received were the best gift I have ever been given. It hasn't been easy but I have been getting weened off medications and all previous tests since engraftment have shown remission. While I will have to wait several days for full results everything points to molecular remission.

I came to this subreddit fresh from diagnosis and found a community that is helpful, caring and understanding of the struggles patients and caregivers go through fighting the disease. It really has helped me to have such a great group of people reading and responding to whatever I felt I needed to say at the time.

A year ago I didn't know if I would see the anniversary of my transplant - and I almost didn't - but here I am and to anyone out there struggling just know that people care and we are here to help. Apparently I am in this for the long haul - please feel free to reach out to me if you need someone to talk to.

I guess I really just want to say thanks to all of you for participating in this community.

352,Need to talk? Got questions? Need a distraction? We have something for you (mod approved),"Hello friends.

About a year ago, I was diagnosed with stage 4 Hodgkins Lymphoma, and immediately, being a redditor, I looked for a cancer related subreddit. Somewhere I could ask questions, get support, and just talk to someone. 

Being a gamer (WoW addict unfortunately), and knowing how universal Discord is, I brought up the suggestion, and not soon after, a Discord server was made. Immediately joined, and we started our own server journey.

From that we've built a community of approximately 200 users currently, more or less. Over 1 year and counting. Some more talkative than others, myself being almost always on. Since day 1, I've been able to make some great friendships, got questions answered by people, and able to get through one of, if not the hardest time in my life. Now I want to offer (well, make more visible) our servers to every one reading this subreddit, since the new layouts and mobile apps don't offer the visibility to see the link.


**https://discord.gg/zGA3b4m**

Any and all are welcome in the server. We just ask you mind a few rules (just about same as in the subreddit) and respect others. We have people going through treatment, people in remission, caretakers, and everything in between.

While it may require an account, it's worth the few seconds. We have people almost constantly on, and willing to talk or even just listen. Don't be shy. Just say hey and feel free to jump into whatever we're talking about. We would love to talk with you.

353,Found out I have ovarian cancer yesterday. I’m 18 and haven’t heard any good news in months. I am torn apart and need advice.,"For the past few weeks I have been dealing with the discovery of a giant, cantaloupe sized teratoma. It had all the signs of being benign up until it was removed. My laparoscopic surgery was last Tuesday and I’ve recovered alright so far. My OBGYN called me and my mom in yesterday at four to discuss the pathology results and then I heard that awful word: malignant. Apparently the type of Ovarian cancer I have is in the 1% so I literally feel like all the odds are against me. Luckily it is stage 1 and they are hoping I won’t have to undergo chemo, but I will have to go back in for surgery again to get my right ovary removed (which my doctor spend 3 hours trying to save). I’m just scared that it will escalate because so far, all of the things that I’ve been told are “unlikely”, “uncommon”, or  “1-5%” have all happened to me. So they are saying it’s unlikely I will have to go through chemo and all that but I’m an uncommon case. After I found out, I sat in my mom’s car and literally was waiting to wake up from a dream. Still waiting to wake up. It doesn’t feel real and I’ve been telling everyone about it and it almost feels like I’m lying because it’s so unreal. I’m terrified and I had a breakdown last night and I have been on the verge of tears for so long. Before all of this, my graduation, Prom, and Italy trip got cancelled. I haven’t seen a lot of my friends and people I love because of quarantine. I got accepted into NYU and Pratt, and want to go to Pratt but it’s in New York and don’t know if I will even be able to go on campus this year. I know everyone has to deal with this but it feels like there’s been so much bad news on top of bad news and I just need some good news. I am feeling so much and I don’t know what to do. I know a lot of people in this subreddit are going through similar things, so I am just reaching out in hopes for anything that can help.

354,Dad has colon cancer,"We don’t know what stage yet - it could be anything from stage 2-4. As a family we went through cancer before with my mum, and lost grandparents in the past too. Before however, we could hug and go to chemo. I don’t live with my parents, I am lucky I can work from home, but I have flatmates so can’t isolate which means I can’t safely see  my family. When my dad told me the diagnosis he wanted to hug and I had to say no - which has completely broken me.

I am really struggling because I am in a position where I don’t know if I should put my life on hold, get out of my lease, and move into my parents house to be there to support them and spend time with them. I know that is the right thing to do, and if the worst happens and I don’t do it I will never forgive myself. Especially as I don’t want my sister to carry the burden of looking after my parents alone. 

But, I’m also petrified that part of me will resent them if I do that. I also need the support from my friends which I would lose if I move in with my parents as most of my friends are key workers.

355,Mom with Stage 4 lung cancer daily care,"My mom has been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer (spread to brain and liver) in June 2019 . She doesn't realize that treatment is just a way to extend her life, not a cure. She's very tired all the time and her left side and balance don't work properly (brain tumor) but she refuses to get anyone to help her at home with daily chores, so she just stopped cleaning altogether. I come and visit when I can and one of my brothers takes care of her the rest (most) of the time, but he works during the day. Some days she's ok and can walk to and from the bathroom alone, others she can't or risks falling every step she takes. She wakes up twice a night to go to the bathroom and needs help doing these short trips (about 20 feet). She already fell a few times and now has a scar on her face because of her lack of balance. Recently I ended up changing her diaper and cleaning poop off of her and out of her bed. My brother and her both insists she doesn't need help. She also can't fix her own food. 

I feel like this is no way of living and the good relationship I once had with my mom is gone. Sometimes I find myself wishing it would be over sooner... I feel bad about it... but it hurts to see my mom in this state with no help and no idea what's going on.

356,How can I help my girlfriends and her family,"Today my girlfriends father was diagnosed with colon cancer which has already spread into the liver. They are now running tests if it has spread any further, but the results could take up to 10 days.

I'm trying to be there for her and her family while leaving enough space for them to be together in private. Also I'm trying to research treatments, facilities and options. What else could I do to help? What do next of kin need the most in this time? I don't want to impose myself on them, but I want to help as much as I can. What kind of support could they need?

357,I'm driving myself home from the appointment in which I was told I am dying.,"To be fair, I'm not driving. The Clara Barton parkway has the little lots by the Potomac. There's a steady, heavy rain on the roof of this borrowed car. It won't last long. Blue sky and sunshine are at the horizon, even while lightening flashes above.

I don't want to go home. If it was just my husband I'd rush to him. But my mom is there and my kids. 

My kids. Every time I think of them the screen of my phone blurs away.  Just today my daughter cried when I left for my appointment. She doesn't do that often, because appointments for me are usually 2-3 times weekly. But she was feeling exceptionally attached today. She sat on my lap this morning. She asked if I would nap with her. She 6, she doesn't even nap anymore. But she wanted time with just me, away from the 5 other kids my mom provides daycare for at our house.

Instead, I read to her. I'm trying to ease her into chapter books. But after one short chapter, I acquiesced to her demand that I read some Bernstein Bears. It hurt to read that long. By the time I was done I was taking long, raspy breaths every few sentences. I read through the pain to my son last night, too, continuing my lifelong ambition to read Harry Potter aloud to my kids. My daughter doesn't like it, but my son(8) and I just started the Goblet of Fire.

My doctor wants me to get a tracheotomy. Permanent this time. But it won't remove all the fingers of cancer gripping my throat. It will just keep me from dying in an ambulance due to this growing airway obstruction. Or, as he says, ""for comfort."" I wonder how much effort reading will be with the tracheotomy.

I've had other doctors tell me I'm dying before. But I never could conceive of it being imminent. There is something about struggling to breathe that makes the whole thing much more concrete than past times. 

I've also had more fight in me before. I've known I could make it through more chemo, more radiation, more surgery. Four and a half years into this and I don't feel so certain. Surgery won't take this out.  Neither will radiation. So... chemo is left and I can safely say I'd rather be dead than back on a platinum based chemotherapy.

I don't want to go home. It used to be the thing I feared the most was my kids not remembering me. Now it's the conversation that is looming, closer than ever. The moment when we sit them down and have to tell them I'm done trying.

I don't want to go home, because maybe that day is today. Maybe tonight I'll sign a DNR and tomorrow I'll tell my oncologist that we are switching to palliative treatments only.

I didn't think this was coming today. Not really. And I have to make my decision before I get home.


(10 miles later)

I stopped again, after the rain cleared. I bought myself chocolate, and I got a shirt for my son, a stuffed animal for my daughter, and a candy bar for my husband. I'm not sure what my goal is here. Is this supposed to ease this news?

A month ago my doctors told me that everything looked clear. No new growth. I wasn't expecting that. I thought (at the time) the news was bad. My husband came with me to that appointment. He called my dad on the way home with the good news.

When we pulled in, my kids came running out to the car. They were screaming, giddy from the news. We went inside and they could just not calm down. Neither could I. We did a dance party in the kitchen and I gave them ice cream before bed.

But tge pain and swelling kept getting worse. And here I am, hoping some candy and trinkets will ease the anxiety for my kids. The memory of that night a month ago makes my dread for tonight so much worse.

(30 miles later)

I'm only 10 minutes from home when I get back in my car.  There is a little place where you can look over the valley of our town. I live on the mountain on the other side. I'm staring over at my mountain, hearing and seeing my familyn still not finding the words to say to my kids. 

 Somebody ate all the chocolate. Maybe if I stall long enough they'll be in bed.

Anyway, I should get back in the car. Thanks to anyone who listened to my stream of consciousness thus far.

(Home)

I flicked off my lights as I pulled in the driveway. I'm hoping nobody notices I'm sitting out here. As soon as I slam shut the door of the car, this isn't my private pain anymore. It belongs to those I love the most, too.

I've tried before to lie, to not let them know when it is serious. I never make it long. 

I wanted to make a decision about what direction to go before I got home.  I haven't. Here is what I have decided: to go on a walk with my husband. To take my kids to the lake tomorrow. To put off an appointment with my oncologist one more day.

My husband just texted me. Deep breaths. In I go.

362,I just need someone to talk to,"2 and a half years ago, on our 1 year wedding anniversary my wife was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer that had spread to her liver and lungs. It was soul crushing but she fought. 
 Chemo was every other week for a year and half, then surgery to remove the right lobe of her liver, still she fought it. After the surgery we finally got good news, it seemed that the main tumor had shrunk away and the lung biopsy had come back as a negative, we celebrated. 

The week before our 3 year anniversary she said she didn't feel good, so more tests. We got the call on our 3rd anniversary that it had come back and spread, it was larger in her lungs and now had spread into her lymph nodes. That was 6 months ago. For the better part of 3 years she has had chemos, surgery's, and scans, almost every week. 

Today she wants to give up. I hate it, I hate that through all of this where she has fought so hard that her resolve had broken. I hate that nothing we do seems to work. I hate that I have said so many things and we have talked about so much of our future and now it may not happen. I hate that I didn't do things sooner, we were together for 8 years before we got married. I hate that I didn't see the signs of all of this sooner, I hate that I'm not helping anymore. But over everything else, I hate myself the most. All I can think about is how this is effecting me, how will I deal with it and I yelled at her today because of it, in over 10 years of dating and marriage have never raised my voice at her in anger until today, until she gave io and I hate myself for it and now she hates me and there is nothing I can do to take it back. I don't even know if anyone is still reading this but I just needed to say it, I think I need help but I don't know where to go or who to even talk to. I am the bad guy here so I don't even know if I deserve to get help.



EDIT

I just want to say thank you to everyone who has reached out on here and messaged me or commented. I really wasnt expecting anyone to even really read this, let alone have other people pour out their hearts as well. It's odd to say it like this, but it's nice to know I'm not alone even though this is a really shitty thing that I wouldn't wish on anyone. 

We had a talk last night and this morning and she is going to at least finish out this clinical trial she is on and at her appointment Monday im going to talk to someone about help for me.

364,My mum has ovarian cancer,"Last year my dad died from dementia and old age, and shortly before that my mum was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, stage two. 

We have no other real family close by and my sister lives in Europe. So it’s just me. My mum took care of my dad despite being divorced and she is such a saint. I did my best but worked full time otherwise that would have been another burden on them.

My mum is my best friend and she went through a lot with my dad and we thought that she could visit her family overseas once my father passed but with the cancer she can’t.

She had everything removed and doctors are not worried and in her last blood test they found no cancer cells. She’s 71.

I’m getting married in November and having my first baby in January. She’s so excited and I’m so glad she is here. But I hate that she’s sick and can’t do things like she used to. Her blood pressure is up and down due to medication and she’s not well enough to visit my fiancé and I at our home, he would drive her here and back but that is even too much sometimes. 

I don’t want to get too much hope as I know cancer can return, and that other things could suddenly take her. 

What will I do without her ? I still need my mum. I want my daughter to have her grandmother around.

368,Moving home to take care of dad,"Today I am leaving my place (rental) in GA to move home to MA to take care of my father who is nearing the end of his battle with stage 4 lung cancer. I feel pretty wretched because I know in my heart I'm doing the right thing but every part of me is screaming no.  I haven't lived at home for over 15 years.  I'm uprooting my husband and our dogs and moving back to cold climate. I'm leaving my job which isn't always my favorite but it's good work. I'll have to relearn how to drive in the snow and deal with the winter on top of watching my dad decline.  I think my conflicted feelings are just stemming from me leaving my comfort zone and knowing that the inevitable is looming. My father has been withdrawn so I know it will be good to be there but I also have a feeling he isn't looking forward to the situation, though that just may be me being my own worst enemy with negative thoughts. Everyone who I've spoken to about this says I won't regret making this move but would have regretting not being closer. We have a lot to take care of too.

370,How to Focus,"I’ve had* a very hard time focusing on anything. Brain keeps wandering to my moms state and diagnosis. 

She was diagnosed three weeks ago, and she has gotten her first round of chemo which has made sores in her mouth and she is hardly able to swallow. My Dad was self-prescribed bed rest because of an addiction to pain pills and an injured back, so he is trying to get it together but is having a hard time not being selfish. He gets sad when she is frustrated and goes to bed, which doesn’t help anything. She will be getting a home health care nurse, and has gotten mouth swabs, some mouth rinse they are compounding and plenty of pain pills. I asked her doctor if we can do anything about her nutrition if she can’t swallow.

 But right now I’m at a loss for what else I can do and I feel terrible and I can’t concentrate. Hence a  reddit post to those who understand.

I have a future to look forward to and life that wouldn't be possible without the hard work and dedication of the trained physicians and doctors. 

I had meant to write more about what it all means to me, but a part of me didnt want to acknowledge the journey I was embarking on. A lot of it is too hard to think about. I did my best to stay strong for my family, with only a handful of breakdowns. But through it all, I tried focusing on the future and trying creating the best memories possible.

I have a lot to celebrate on this day, but the current state of affairs has got me feeling very helpless and vulnerable. It seems the dam is about to break where I live and everyone fed up with the lockdown is defying stay at home and refusing to wear masks. I hope for nothing more than this crisis to pass, but I really hope people don't have to start losing their own loved ones before they start taking it serious.

380,Feeling terrible for not being more excited,"Last September my mom was diagnosed with Pancreatic cancer. On Friday her doctor informed her she is cancer free and done with chemo. Instead of being elated, I'm feeling extremely anxious because this means she will be living with me again.

Due to finances, I have been living with my mom for the past few years (the last two I have been attending grad school). I do love my mom but she is VERY needy. Depression, childhood trauma, and two failed marriages have really taken their toll. She sees me as her closest friend still while for years I have felt like the parent in the relationship.

When Covid hit our state, my mom moved in with her mother because I still had to work. It was a blessing as she is a retired nurse and the company was good for both of them. My grandmother is a natural caretaker and was on my mom about exercising, eating, taking meds, etc. Not only do I work full time, but I'm trying to finish my degree. Honestly, I don't know if either my mom or I would have survived lock-down together!

These few months have been the first time in ten years I have not lived with my mother, and it was so nice! We would usually still talk once a day, but I loved the freedom being by myself- no one to explain things to, not having to compromise activities because of someone else, just me and the animals. 

At her last doctor visit, not only was she declared cancer free but they said it was safe for her to return home. I don't know if I even felt a second of joy before the dread hit thinking of her coming home. I am terrified of returning to life with her here and feel like I am headed towards a wall at full speed and there is no steering wheel.

382,Today I just found out my dad has Cancer.,"Hi I am new to this group and  I never in a million years thought I would be here or thinking about my dad's mortality so soon, he is 65 and just about to retire next year. 

I got the dreaded phone call this morning from my mom. I knew this week her and my dad would find out the good or bad news of his endoscopy that yielded an unfortunate discovery of why he was having months of chronic acid reflux and indigestion. Last week they found a tumor, only 7mm in between his stomach and esophagus. It is cancer of the stomach and esophagus, is what his gastroenterologist said when she personally called my mom and dad on the results of his biopsy.  I heard the fear and worry in my mom's voice when she told me the news. Deep down I had feeling it was not going to be good news but I am trying to be positive for my mom. The scary part is what stage he will be diagnosed at with his cancer. I am really praying for 1 or 2. The thought of chemo, radiation and surgery for my dad and what he will have to endure is the hardest part to think about. I know he is a strong man and stubborn. He has my mom who is a rock to make sure he doing what he is told and keeping is diet in check with nutrition and making sure he does what the doctors want him to do.

Also, I am an only child, adult, and live 500 miles away from  my parents with a little family of my own. I have no siblings to lean into for comfort or support for the tough decision making that may come later.. It is just my mom and dad.  This is why I'm scared and worried he is going to leave this planet too soon and leave my mom on her own living far away.  But I know I can't think that way. 2020 is such shit year.

384,"Please, think before you ask...","I’m an on again off again lurker here. Some of the stories are painful and dig up some bad times and I snapped a bit today. 

This sub and the people here are to support each other in what I’d argue is one of the most difficult things a human can endure. They are not here to be your personal reassurance bots. 

I understand that in this moment you might be scared and having intrusive thoughts, but please, please, PLEASE think of the audience that you are soliciting advice from. NOT ONLY can they NOT give you any real medical advice aside from saying go to a doctor, but you are asking people who are dealing with so much more emotional trauma than you could ever imagine. 

If you think you are sick then please go ask a medical professional.  Get the proper tests done. You don’t have anything until you have been diagnosed. 

I don’t want to speak for anyone here, but I know that there are probably some in here who wish their biggest problem right something might be wrong. 

The people in here giving and getting support are fighting for their lives, the lives of their loved ones. They are here to help and be helped in this daunting journey and the last thing anyone needs is to talk someone in a state of panic and anxiety bombarding them with subjective questions about their health. 

If you absolutely need to get the advice of strangers I strongly suggest visit r/askdocs or more appropriately r/healthanxiety 

r/healthanxiety is specifically a support community for people who uncontrollable anxiety towards their health and is a place to vent your fears of undiagnosed symptoms and what they might be.

387,"Delirium, slurred speech... is this the end?","Hey guys, it's been very helpful to read some of the threads that you have posted. My mom almost two months ago was given a month to live. I'm wondering if it's the end, I'd love some opinions.

Obviously for the past few months she has been getting weaker and weaker, she can still eat/drink/swallow, and even gets out of bed to go to the bathroom (with either a walker or wheelchair). Yesterday she had a good day, being wheeled around the house while my dad and I cleaned/decorated for her. Two nights ago she was confused in the middle of the night and was slurring her words, it got better in the morning, but it returned last night and has not left (it is now almost noon and still slurred words and confused). She still gets out of bed to use the bathroom and sits up in bed to eat cereal. 

Her cancer is in the brain and liver, and I know both brain mets and liver failure can cause delirium/slurred speech, but so can being in the last few days of life. It's so difficult that we don't know how much longer she has. Obviously the most I can do to try and figure out how much longer she has is to read stories from other people who have gone through this. I just hope that she is not in this state for several more weeks or months. I would hate to see that. 

Before her symptoms were controlled with meds she was confused as well but it quickly turned to being scared/paranoid. I don't mind if she is a ""happy confused"", asking me about my fishing trips (I don't fish) or about going on a limo ride (huh?). I just hate to see her suffer.",3.0,"['delirium', 'slurred', 'speech', 'end', 'hey', 'guys', 'been', 'helpful', 'read', 'some', 'threads', 'posted', 'mom', 'number', 'months', 'ago', 'given', 'month', 'live', 'I am', 'wondering', 'end', 'id', 'love', 'some', 'opinions', 'obviously', 'past', 'few', 'months', 'has', 'been', 'getting', 'weaker', 'weaker', 'eatdrinkswallow', 'even', 'gets', 'out', 'bed', 'bathroom', 'either', 'walker', 'wheelchair', 'yesterday', 'had', 'good', 'day', 'being', 'wheeled', 'around', 'house', 'while', 'famrel', 'cleaneddecorated', 'number', 'nights', 'ago', 'confused', 'middle', 'night', 'slurring', 'words', 'got', 'better', 'morning', 'returned', 'last', 'night', 'has', 'not', 'left', 'now', 'noon', 'slurred', 'words', 'confused', 'gets', 'out', 'bed', 'use', 'bathroom', 'sits', 'up', 'bed', 'eat', 'cereal', 'cancer', 'brain', 'liver', 'know', 'both', 'brain', 'mets', 'liver', 'failure', 'because', 'deliriumslurred', 'speech', 'so', 'being', 'last', 'few', 'days', 'life', 'so', 'difficult', 'do not', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'longer', 'has', 'obviously', 'most', 'do', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'much', 'longer', 'has', 'read', 'stories', 'other', 'people', 'gnumber', 'through', 'just', 'hope', 'not', 'state', 'several', 'more', 'weeks', 'months', 'would', 'hate', 'see', 'before', 'symptoms', 'controlled', 'meds', 'confused', 'well', 'quickly', 'turned', 'being', 'scaredparanoid', 'do not', 'mind', 'happy', 'confused', 'asking', 'about', 'fishing', 'trips', 'do not', 'fish', 'about', 'going', 'on', 'limo', 'ride', 'huh', 'just', 'hate', 'see', 'suffer']",delirium slurred speech end hey guys been helpful read some threads posted mom number months ago given month live I am wondering end id love some opinions obviously past few months has been getting weaker weaker eatdrinkswallow even gets out bed bathroom either walker wheelchair yesterday had good day being wheeled around house while famrel cleaneddecorated number nights ago confused middle night slurring words got better morning returned last night has not left now noon slurred words confused gets out bed use bathroom sits up bed eat cereal cancer brain liver know both brain mets liver failure because deliriumslurred speech so being last few days life so difficult do not know how much longer has obviously most do try figure out how much longer has read stories other people gnumber through just hope not state several more weeks months would hate see before symptoms controlled meds confused well quickly turned being scaredparanoid do not mind happy confused asking about fishing trips do not fish about going on limo ride huh just hate see suffer
388,So Tired,"I (F47) almost told my father (66) to f\* off and get out of my house today.  I need a break and my vacation with my sister on Friday to Cuba cannot come fast enough.  


My father was diagnosed with angiosarcoma Jan 2017 in his two cheeks and brow areas.  He is one of the rare of the rare with this cancer (which is rare in itself) as the majority of those who get it are other cancer survivors (radiation induced)...his just happened after a large garbage can hit him in the face and left a bruise.  


My father lives with me and for the most part we get along, I learned to ignore his constant negativity (i.e you can say ""look dad there's a blue jay on the veranda"" and his comment would be ""great, he'll probably shit every where"") over the years but it is getting so bad that I hate being around him and talking to him as it just brings me down.  


I am losing my empathy because of his attitude and constant negativity - I feel horrible in saying this but I with the cancer would just hurry up and end it because I am not sure how much longer I can live with him and it is only getting worse.  


He did chemo in 2017 - did really well with it but in June had some kind of heart or stroke issue and after one more month of chemo removed it from it.  They let his body heal until Dec 2017 when his face started up again and they put him on doxil (an infusion that lasts 3 weeks and then you go back and get another) but in a week he landed in the hospital with no white blood count for a week.  No more chemo for him.    


Radiation was started March 2018 until May 2018 - he almost made it through all planned rounds (22 of 25) of his cheeks but cut short the radiation around his eyes (9 of 15) as he couldn't take the eye pain anymore (his eyelids looked like crispy bacon).  It took him a good 6 months to heal from that.  

  
He has opted for no more treatment, and he goes to a palliative care doctor every 3-4 weeks and a nurse visits every other week.  His face is getting very angry and with it his moods.  He is on many pills (steroids, antibiotics, probiotics, metformin (started today), etc, etc and blew up at me just now when I brought the new med home about how many pills he is taking and what does he call this one and he has to take it two times a day and then proceeds to read off the side affects, getting angrier and angrier.  He goes on about the two times a day WITH food and I couldn't bite my tongue and said, well...you do eat twice a day so I'm not seeing a problem.  I had to walk away because I was about to blow up at him.  Not just because of that, but 5min before I had walked into the house after grocery shopping and no sooner than I closed the door he was complaining about my robot vacuum (""tired of hearing it so I just picked it up and put it back to its home and it better not decide to continue!"") and then I got ""my face found a new place to leak"" and he shows me the bridge of his nose and ""how the hell am I suppose to sleep now?"" and he continued on that ramp...then the metformin...  
It has been non-stop for a good two weeks now.  Thursday as I left for work in the morning just as I closed the door he yelled out ""I'm going to talk to the doctor tomorrow about assisted suicide"" and then that was on my brain all day.  And of course he didn't (I went to his appointment with him) and he was jovial and nice (the doctor calls him an excuse for an excuse right to his face as my father has excuses for everything of why he cannot do what the doctor asks him to do).  


I really wish my Grandma was alive (his mom) as he's always been like this and she always helped me with his moods.  But now it just me (all siblings live over an hour away) and it is getting worse every.single.day.  He doesn't want treatment, so it is just going to get worse.  His decision!  I have all these horrible thoughts in my head, I just want it over, please don't let this go on and on.  I want my life back.  


Thank you for letting me rant.

389,"She's not gone yet, but I miss my Mom so much.","3 months ago. My mom was perfectly healthy. She never got sick, and if she got a cold or something she'd drink some tea and be okay again. I was finishing up school and my Mom was so excited for my summer vacation, and my Dad was the only sick person of the family, with glaucoma and diabetes. Mom always took care of him. 

My Mom's urine started turning yellow, and she'd never had yellow urine. Her entire life it'd been clear, she was always hydrated. She went to the doctor, after not having gone for maybe 6 years. Her eyes started turning yellow, and she got extreme, extreme itching. I was so scared seeing her in pain. 

If any of my classmates saw this they'd make fun of me, but I've always slept in the same bed with my Mom. I know it's weird. When I was 6 I slept in the same bed as my Dad and my Mom, but then Dad got glaucoma and we were scared of hitting his eyes or something. And then I never really grew out of it, no matter how many times I said I would. The comfort of having my Mom near me, especially when I was scared of my Dad going blind, was so nice. She'd tell me stories from her kindergarten days to her college days and we'd just laugh until we fell asleep. I'm so close to my Mom, so when she was itching, it hurt me to see her in pain. 

That's also left me with adjustment issues because once she started having extreme itching, she couldn't be in the same bed as me and I could never sleep on my own. 

Maybe around June 10th she went to the doctor with my Dad, and they immediately sent her to the ER. I was terrified. They sent her to a hospital and she liked it there! I would stay with her in the day, while my Dad had work. Mom didn't work though, she's always been a housewife, so it was easy for her to take a break, but not for me and my Dad. Hell, we didn't know how to use our dishwashing for a little while. 

Then she got diagnosed with cancer, and my world fell apart. I couldn't eat at all. Just looking at food made me want to vomit. Never had I imagined a world without my Mom.

God I did so much research, but it's in the worst place, it's not operable, she can't get a transplant, and she doesn't wanna do chemo because her mother had a bad experience doing chemo for lung cancer. I cried so much. The doctors said she only had 1 year. She always tried to tell me she was gonna live for 5 more years, with the aurvedic medicine that she wanted to try. We're Indian, but we live in the US, by the way. 

She had a surgery to put what I think is called a catheter in her right and life bile ducts. Her blood pressure went down, and she was put in the ICU. She was depressed. I had never seen her so depressed. She could barely eat. And the doctors said she had 3-6 weeks. (It's been like 7 weeks after this and my Mom's still alive) My Dad was debating putting her in hospice. I was broken. I didn't think I could ever live without my Mom, especially not at my age. I'm only 14. 

We somehow got her to go to India. My Dad went with her in business class seats on a flight, which cost him a lot of money, but was most definitely worth it, because she's doing better there. Surrounded by friends and family, and is eating a lot. 

She's in some hospital in India, and I've been able to distract myself from the scary word that is cancer, because every adult is telling me she has like 5 more years, and because it's want to hear, I believe them naively. I still video call her every day though. But, I was hoping maybe they could operate on it there, and cure her, but even there they can't do it. I don't know why I thought it'd be any different. Now they can't do chemo though, she's apparently too weak. She wants to try aurvedic medicine, but that's no replacement for chemo and radiation I don't think. I just don't wanna lose my Mom. I love her so much, and god I hate sounding selfish. Is it selfish to want more time? 

I still can't sleep on my own. It was so much easier with her. I could fall asleep easy then, now I stay up till late hours in the night, I'm literally writing this at 1 am. I really miss my Mom. And I'm such a baby, needing to be in the same bed as her Mom but everything has gotten harder since she hasn't been here for me. 

My Dad has had to rewrite everything, like his will and stuff. He tells me about what'll happen if he and my Mom die, and god that's one of my greatest fears. He was sure of the fact he would die first, but now we can't be sure of anything. I've also debated therapy to cope with everything, but he thinks it'll cause more problems. 

I just want everything to go back to the way it was, but it's too much to ask for. I hope I don't sound selfish. My head is pounding just thinking about her. Everything is so overwhelming. 

I've wrote on this sub-reddit before, this exact same story, but this includes much more detail, and I really needed to get this stuff out, I'm feeling hopeless right now. If anyone knows anything about bile duct cancer that could possibly help my Mom it would help greatly. Or how to cope, that would probably help me.

391,Cancer sucks,"Earlier this year, my grandma got diagnosed with breast cancer. Stage 2, but progressed to 3. She started aggressive chemo treatment, and the tumor was also aggressive, but that made her super sick and super weak. There was a point in time when she didnt think she wanted to continue the chemo. 
She eventually continued to fight, and finished chemo and went to surgery then radiation. Lately she has been in and put of the hospital with supposed pneumonia. Only to find out today that she actually has cancer spread to her liver and one lung. She also has a mass pressing on her brachial tube.  She is not getting chemo this time,but wants to be kept comfortable for as long as possible.

394,My CT scan came back clean,"Just wanted to be able to share the news with others who can understand scan-xiety. Had triple negative breast cancer March of last year and underwent 7 months of chemo, surgery, and radiation. 

I was experiencing shortness of breath so I had a chest CT done 3 months ago and two new nodes lit up on my cancer side. 

Still too small to biopsy my pulmonologist ordered a scan in 3 months time to reassess.

395,Dad is dying and can barely speak,"My dad was diagnosed with an extremely rare and aggressive cancer called thymic carcinoma in March of 2019. It metastasized to his brain in November and was treated with surgery + radiation, but returned last week. He's been given 4-6 months to live, but he can barely whisper due to the paralytic effect on his vocal cords. I live far away and visit when I can, but I just had major surgery and am unable to travel. He's in a nursing facility because my mom is too physically frail to take care of him, and she's visiting as often as she's able, but she also has to take care of all of the bills and everything else in his absence. I'm just struggling to conceive of him continuing to suffer like this, and how it could have any meaning if he's alone and voiceless and depressed most of the time. What's the point of being alive like this???  We managed to have a special last Christmas, but it's been downhill ever since. I just feel so helpless knowing that he's so helpless.

396,How to cope with the uncertainty,"How do you cope with the uncertainty of a family member’s imminent passing. My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer in early December and discontinued all chemo and moved to hospice care this week. I’m a wreck but I can’t find peace with any decisions I make that don’t end up with my traveling back home to make sure I spend every possible second there. How do you balance living your life with spending quality time so you don’t put your life on complete pause but don’t regret not spending time before it’s too late. After hearing from the hospice nurse took a weekend for my own personal mental health and already feeling guilty about it. Had traveled to be there the last 2 weekends and have plans to be there the next 2 weekends. Any tips on how to manage this? The oncologist said to expect a timeline of weeks to months but I feel uneasy to guilty of taking time for my well being knowing his days are limited. Any suggestions would be appreciated. I feel like I’m falling apart completely and emotionally, physically, and mentally exhausted. 

Already in therapy and on medication to help deal with it but after this week and the decision to discontinue chemo it barely feels like it takes the edge off.

Edit: I keep hearing about someone’s cousin’s uncle’s friend’s sister’s acquaintance who made it 7 months on hospice but that doesn’t seem to be realistic at all.

397,So fast. So fucking fast.,"My mate, he was only 36. He started feeling unwell 2 months ago. A cough that wouldn't go away. Tired with no effort. No appetite.

We used to work together as bouncers a bit over a decade ago. Forged a friendship out of conflict. Backed each other. Trusted each other. Fought against all odds together.

Smartest guy I ever knew. I went to him for all my tech related conundrums. He taught me calculus while we were drunk because why wouldn't you do maths while you're hammered?

I went with him to his initial consults to give him support. I'm a university trained paramedic, so I have some insight into the medical jargon he's faced with.

He's started staying at my place. We live 120 Km apart but he's home by himself and clearly needs some support. I've got a front room doing nothing so it's his as long as he needs it.

Last Wednesday they confirm it's a carcinoma, not a lymphoma like they were expecting, since the first indication was his enlarged lymph nodes. He's rattled but still physically looking okay.

He comes to stay with me and my other mate. The three of us are as close as brothers. We watch him deteriorate in front of us. No energy. Short of breath the whole time. Eventually he starts to struggle and my other mate has to take him to hospital in the middle of the night.

I didn't even pick it. I knew he was unwell. I encouraged him to go to the doctor. He had no acute signs until well after he got to the ED.

He went into heart failure. I got there about 20 minutes before he died. My other mate was on his way from work. His estranged partner has a long drive ahead and was twenty minutes out.

He told me to tell her he loved her.

He arrested.

I had my blinders on.

Clinically I knew he was dying.

Optimistically I knew he was going to be fine. I stepped out of the room to let the doctors and nurses work. I've run arrest scenes before. I know the last thing you need is an emotional bystander messing it up.

Our other mate had just arrived at the ED. I'd go down and get him. We'd go  up and they'd give me the good news. They'd managed to successfully resuscitate him.

The doctor told me he'd died. It didn't make sense. I was just there and he was alive. He'd spoken to me and he was alive.

When his partner arrived I had to tell her. Longest 20 minute wait I ever had to endure. She arrived hoping for the best. She's a doctor. She knew he'd be fine.

She had her blinders on.

We lost the most intelligent, insightful, analytical crazy arsehole who wound people up because he could. The guy who was smarter than the next three people you could line up, but couldn't be comfortable opening up to anyone.

The man-mountain whom I once saw physically hold back an entire mosh pit, earning him the nickname; Obelix.

The man who refused to wear his glasses and so mistook a 50 foot Jesus backdrop while watching P.O.D as a support band for a gigantic portrait of Jimi Hendricks.

The guy who decided to go for a swim in the local lake at 02:00 prompting a visit from the police, who I was able to convince I was going to get him home safely.

You fuckhead.

I'll always miss you.

My mom was supposed to live into her 90s, like her mother; she won’t make it past 61.

There were supposed to be options to treat the cancer palliatively and slow the cancer growth; the oncologists day my mom is too weak for chemotherapy, and that the chemotherapy won’t do anything. 
This cancer rarely spreads to the brain; the MRI from a few days ago shows potential brain lesions.

400,An update on my cancer.,"Hi Everyone I've been a member of /r/Cancer since my diagnosis in June of 2019 and I completed my 'this is me' post. I have tried to be a good lil redditor and be there for people and answer questions to the best of my ability. 

I've been fighting cancer nearly a year now (Low Rectal Adenocarcinoma T3 N1 M1) and I can for the very first time come here with good news.

I don't know why I got to be so lucky, but I just got my scan results back after completing 28 sessions of chemo-radiotherapy and my primary tumour, the bowel lymph, bowel wall and systemic cancer in my right seminal vesicle is gone.  
It cannot be seen on my MRI or CT scans at all. Gone... Nada!  


It is bitter sweet though, my lung mets have shown a ""small, but significant increase"" bringing the total number of mets to 5 from 1.5 from the previous rounds of Irinotecan (5FU) chemotherapy late last year.

So after putting the phone down to my oncologist, I am going back on 5FU with Irinotecan again and this time I am on Avastin. It should be starting in the next 5-6 days. I am currently on Cloud 9, both me and my finacée are just over the moon. It's just not sunk in yet.

I blog about this and you can catch it [here](https://cam-mortimer.com) if you wanna have a read. You can read the whole cancer story [here](https://cam-mortimer.com/cancer/) also.

488,"Diagnosed in June, Dead in August","My wonderful husband was diagnosed with cancer in June. In August we did 10 days of radiation. Then Monday, August 19, we took him to see the surgeon about having a port placed for chemo. We knew the cancer had spread to many areas, but the oncologist thought that chemo would help extend his life. He couldn't stand up long enough to get from the car to the wheelchair. We had to get staff from the surgeon's office to help us get him into the wheelchair and into the doctor's office. The surgeon looked at him and sent us to the ER.

The ER staff moved us from a regular room to the trauma room. They found fluid around his heart. A few minutes after they went in to drain it, people started running into and out of the room. Literally running, not just walking fast. They got him somewhat stabilized and told us that we needed to get him to a hospital in the city (about 90 min by car). It was a rotten way to get a helicopter ride, and I am sure he didn't even get to enjoy it. The hospital had to intubate him to give him pain meds. He had been moaning and whining when they tried to drain the fluid from his heart. We heard it from outside the rood. So having him sent by air ambulance to the city was NOT good news. If it had just been his heart, his cardiologist could have handled it at the hospital at home. But his kidneys were not working, and we don't have a kidney doc at out hospital.

By the time I got to the hospital, he was in the ICU. The nurses and doctors were AMAZING. So caring, and not just about him. I finally managed to get away to find a hotel at about midnight. The next few days were a whirl of hospital, hotel, my mom and kids coming up to visit and/or stay, and my inlaws and his sister coming to visit. It was awful but also good.

On Wednesday we decided to let him go on Thursday afternoon. He and I had our 28th anniversary on the 10th, and on the 22nd I had to say goodbye. It just is so awful and painful.

After they took the tubes out, our sons read him to sleep. He spent many years reading stories to them, complete with all the voices. So our boys got a copy of one of my husband's favorite book series for kids (Hank the Cowdog) and they read until the end. It was the sweetest thing I have ever seen them do.

562,Good News Today,"After finding a tumor in his rectum on July 7, Dad completed his pet scan on Friday to see if there was any spread. 

Radiation Specialist confirmed that there’s no cancer present anywhere beside the 8cm tumor, only a small spot in a lymph node that is too insignificant to consider concerning.

I am so unbelievably relieved. At this point, he’s looking at 3 months of hardcore chemo/radiation to shrink the tumor and then surgery. 

Every doctor keeps commenting on how healthy he is and that he should be able to withstand this aggressive treatment. (62 yo smoker, used to do a fair bit of hard drugs in his younger years, and definitely doesn’t eat well). I don’t necessarily believe in God but there’s something/someone watching out for him. 

I hope the treatment goes as well as the team thinks, hearing how hopeful he was today was amazing.

563,Bad things keep happening :/,"3 years ago my father passed away due to alcoholism. Not too long after my grandma was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, she went into remission and not long after that my grandfather was diagnosed as well with ageo sarcoma. Back in April of 2018, he passed away and today we found out my mother has breast cancer that has spread into her neck (cervical 2,3 and possibly 1) also to 2 ribs all on her right side. I’m asking for prayers as my family and I can’t handle any more bad news 😢 

Update: moms in Roswell now, all loopy, slurry and tired. Super worried about her. They had to do another biopsy on her neck because the first wasn’t done in a right place I guess.

564,It's like the whole world is against me,"I just needed to talk about it.
My mother has Stage 4 Lymphoma and it has already gone terminal. It has spread all over her body and now she is experiencing immense pain. It is extremely hard to watch. We can't do anything but to give her painkillers. I'm just 19, all throughout childhood, I had watch how my family became broken with so much anger and hatred due to my parents' marriage. My mom directed her anger at my brother and I which has deeply damaged us mentally however, I understood why she did it and beared with it. Even if I found it so unfair but I can't do anything about her own character. I know that she still loves me and I still love her despite everything that has happened in my life. We don't have a proper mother and daughter relationship due to a language barrier which caused misunderstandings as well as my mom's dictator like personality. However, I still have respect for her because I know how much she has sacrificed for her family. I knew she herself is dealing with alot like me and my brother. But then, she has cancer for 3 years and when I just recieved the news, I was devastated. She didn't deserve this! I just don't understand why she had it in the first place. I begin to think that we were cursed and that we deserved it. I became less religious when I was younger due to my troubled childhood, and to me, I think God is just a creator and doesn't perform any miracles. You need to earn it through your own hard work and if miracles did happen to you, I merely thought it was just coincidence and luck. Please don't preach at me. I don't need anybody to talk to me about God. I have people coming up to me and tell me that it could be karma. It could be. But I don't want to think about it. I just hoped that my mother would be there for my wedding and meet her future children but that wouldn't be possible.
I feel like what's the point in all this. Is it to test me on how strong I am? Well I've lost and you won whoever is messing up with my life.

565,Teen (13F) embarrassed of my cancer (33F).,"I was diagnosed with leukemia Aug 2019 and had a BMT Dec 2019.  Spend a good 4 1/2 months in the hospital due to complications. 

During that time, my daughter refused to let any of her friends know what was happening at home, and when they found out, she was extremely embarrassed. She said she ‘didn’t want to be known as the girl who’s mom has cancer’. It was quite upsetting to her when the news circulated her school, even though the feedback was sympathetic and supportive.  

Now I’m home and doing well. My hair is just now growing back, and I have dar circles under my eyes, but i no longer scream’CANCER PATIENT!!’ When you look at me.   However, my daughter refuses to participate in any outside activities with me if it’s close to home (walking, riding bikes, etc).  She states it’s because she doesn’t want people to know the sad story of her mom having cancer and she’s embarrassed .  I’ve tried to reason with her by offering to wear a headscarf or a wig, but no luck. She doesn’t want to be seen in public with me. At home, indoors, she’s fine. If I drive 20/30 minutes away to go hiking or whatever with her, she’s fine as now one knows her’. 

She has been in therapy this whole time and her therapist just said to ‘give it time’, as she’s young. 

I know this whole thing has been hard on her and she’s only 13, but Jesus, it absolutely kills me my child feels this way. I don’t really know how to resolve the situation and now that it is getting nicer out, I’d like to be able to go do stuff with her without driving 30 minutes away.

596,My dad is going to pass away soon and I really don't know how to handle the whole mess,"I'm 21m, mum is 59 and dad is 57 just FYI. 

So may dad has been fighting cancer for a few years now, his first being penile cancer, then lymph nodes, now it's in his liver and bones. Before he was diagnosed with the bone and liver cancers I moved out to be with my bf, little under an hr or so away, so my mom has been handling it herself really with me trying to help but not really wanting to be involved that much. I don't want to be really involved because I don't want my last memories of my dad of him suffering and unable to be independent of anything.

I don't really know, even now as my mom going to be talking with a hospice nurse, how to comprehend the whole situation. I know it's bad, and it's hard for my mom, and obviously my dad, but I've just been attack from the rest of my family for not quitting my job and moving back in with my parents to be with my dad. Anytime I go on FB messenger I always have some shit from my mum or grandma about how I don't do enough, or i don't understand the situation, or just blaming my bf for controlling me.

598,How do I find support?,"My mom is the caregiver for my dad (glioblastoma patient) and she needs help.

What I want to find is a local support group, not one over the phone, but something in person I can take her to so she can just listen and know she's not alone. And, when she's ready, a group she can confide in without worrying about burdening her children (her concern, which of course is not legitimate).

600,"Difficult situation, would appreciate help from those also with incurable cancers","Hey. So I've posted here a few times before. General gist is I got diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer a couple months ago, aged 23. It's in my lungs and it's pretty bad. Right from the start they said that it was incurable and that I'd be getting treatment for the rest of my life. I started on a round of chemo (which was light and thus did not impact my life much at all) but a recent CT scan shows that this chemo has had little effect. There is an option of massive surgery but my surgeon only wants to do that if my life suddenly becomes at risk, it wouldn't be healing me, it'd be keeping me alive and since it'd be so intense they only want to do it if its absolutely necessary. 

So. My difficult situation. My doctors said that I could try a further round of chemo, but this would be the intense, hair-removing, highly destructive stuff that would impact my quality of life a lot. My doctor also said that this last-ditch chemo option had a less than 10% chance of actually working. It might just make my last few months extremely horrible with no reward. My other option is to do nothing and simply enjoy what time I have left, with my doctors working to alleviate pressure from symptoms. I'm currently doing pretty good so far, you wouldn't even think I'd caught a cold this past year.

I am aware that this is the sort of situation where this is no right answer. There's simply picking the option that is best for you. But I really don't know. I want to live more than anything. But chemo is terrifying, and I hate being sick, I just want to be unconscious when I don't feel good, and I wouldn't ever finish chemo and go back to my old life. It'd just be accepting being very ill as a stage of life before I die. And that's if it works. It's more likely that it won't work and I'll just add more misery onto my life before I die. But I say that and I still want to do it because I don't want to die even though I'm gonna hate life the whole time. The option of doing nothing is something I am considering, because I know I can't cheat an early death, but I find the thought of just sitting there and not doing anything to combat the illness inside me extremely difficult. I genuinely would try doing essential oils or something just as a little sanity-restoring thing if I went with that option. So far with my treatment I've been... holidaying, essentially, I've been seeing friends and watching a lot of tv and spending time with my family. I've really enjoyed this break from adult life in a weird way. I don't want to give that freedom up for chemo. I read a blog from a woman in her thirties who was diagnosed with incurable cancer, fought it with chemo a bit and got a few more years that way but eventually called it quits. The fact that she tried makes me feel like I have to try. I feel like there's this pressure on me to fight (everyone everywhere tells you to fight cancer and that's great and all but I already lost my fight guys) and it goes against a lot to just say, no, I'm not doing that. 

My one vague compromise is to do nothing, enjoy what time I have left, and when I get hospitalised or ill enough that I can't enjoy my life as I did before, then I try the chemo. Because at that point I won't be getting better no matter what I do. I kind of feel like I'm just being a coward though. Too scared to consent to the chemo that realistically will not work. But truthfully, the kind of life that a cancer patient lives - going through chemo with limited strength and no hair and a hundred horrible side-effects from treatment - I don't want to live like that. Idk. I know there isn't really a question here but it's just a bit sad. I would really appreciate hearing from others in my position or from those who are familiar with this sort of situation. The classic cancer story is ""I had this disease and I fought it and I won/lost"" there isn't really any discussion around people who have already lost. 

Edit: I guess, and this is me just being vaguely curious, what would you do if you were in my position?

601,times are tough,"In early March my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. it’s a rare type that starts in the adrenal glands or something, anyway it is now in his lungs, brain, spine, and pancreas. because of how rare this cancer is and how little information there is on it it’s nearly impossible to say what his life expectancy is at this point, but the good news is it appears to be very slow growing.

The only symptom he had before his diagnosis was decreased mental clarity and increased memory loss, but this developed very gradually over the course of like 2 years before he decided to get it checked out. now that he has been through radiation and is starting chemo, however, he is like a totally different person.

He was on high dose steroids for a few weeks, which sent him into a full-blown psychosis that made it impossible for him to stay at home because he was so aggressive with his immediate family (me, . he’s been staying with his sister about an hour away and since then his psychosis symptoms have slowly decreased, but now the chemo has him lethargic, nauseous to the point of not being able to eat at all, and he’s very depressed.

602,Alive and kicking 30 months on.,"Roughly 30 months since I stumbled into the ER back in March 2018 with what I had spent the last year thinking was severe allergies or flu and in agony from pinched nerves/sciatica/a slipped disc and got told I had 4th stage lung cancer (later confirmed to be ALK-related) and that I had 3-6 months to live.

Thanks to my oncologist, to Alectinib, and to my best friend morphine I've made it five to ten times longer than that. I'm also pleased to learn that they're developing new drugs for my condition all the time, so when this one stops working entirely, I can still cling mercilessly to the remnants of my life.

I don't know if I deserve to live as long as this, considering people who've accomplished more than I ever will are worse off than me, but I'm greedy for every second I can get.

604,Double mastectomy unknowingly turned to brain cancer four years later....,"It’ll be three years on April 17th that I found out the worst news of my life. I was sitting at home and the small business that my mom worked for called me. It was her boss on the phone, he proceeded to pass the phone to my mom. She said “Hi” and everything after that was a mumbled mess.. she passed the phone back to her boss. 

-side note-

(I have worked for this small business so I know the owner personally. And when I say small business, I mean small. The town we live in has a population of over a little of 500 people)

He then went on to say what had happened. She couldn’t remember anything. Their names, how to work the till, computer, etc. After our phone call ended I immediately left to drive where she worked. -I only lived about 20 minutes from here-
After I left I called the nurse hotline and told the gal her symptoms. She told me that I should call 911, because the symptoms I gave her basically said that she had a stroke/seizure. 

When I arrived at my moms work place she snapped out of what she called an “episode”

My boss and I asked her if she would, please, go to the hospital and get checked out. She reluctantly agreed.

We made our way to a Mayo Clinic. I’ll spare some boring details, but I left, came back and saw my mom in tears with the nurse beside her.

The first thing the nurse said was.. “Do you want to tell her or would you like me to?”

My mom broke down in tears and I was told she had brain cancer. 


There is a lot more to this story, but as of right now I cannot bring myself to write anymore. 

I will share the rest of my story to those who are interested.

610,End is near,"My father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in May of 2018. It had spread to his small intestines which led to a blockage, and a bypass surgery. Symptoms were apparent since December of 2017. He was not eating well and had abdominal pain once in a while. We thought it was just stress getting to him since his mother was ill. When his mother, my grandmother, passed away in Feb of 2018, he took a trip to ER due to abdominal pain. Again, we thought it was just part of grieving. Maybe, if we had taken him for a proper check-up. Maybe, if the doctor at ER had ordered a CT scan. Maybe, he might have had a chance. We could have had more time to prepare.


So for the last 6 months, he has had 2 rounds of the strongest chemotherapy which did more damage than good. After 5 rounds of the mildest chemotherapy, his body gave up. His bloodwork showed that chemo was working, but he just had no energy left in him. He spent most of his days sleeping, lost over 30 kgs, and couldn't handle the 30 min trip to the hospital anymore. 2 days ago, he got admitted to hospice because doctors don't see more than a couple months left. I promised him I would take him to Okanagan for stargazing and camping. I promised him a trip to Seattle to watch a baseball game. Everything he wanted, or I wanted, seems impossible now. For my graduation, my wedding, the birth of his grandchildren, and the rest of my mother's life, he will not be there. All I will be able to do is go to his memorial, put down flowers, and cry. 


Dad, 

Thank you for all you have done for me. If we meet again as a family, I will make sure your happiness comes first before mine. Let's make sure we are even next time. It was great 23 years of knowing you. Your body may be gone, but I know that you will always be with me for the rest of my life and my mother's life. And don't worry about mom, you know she's a strong woman. I know how good of a husband you were to her. I will try my best to fill your empty space. And please say hi to grandmother. Tell her I am sorry I couldn't visit her more often and that I miss her so much. I know you missed her too. She might be pretty pissed that you found her too soon, but let her know my mother and I are gonna be fine. 


By the way, I'm going to a cemetery tomorrow to pick out a spot for you to rest. I hope you don't mind whatever I pick. 


Good night,  

Your one and only son

614,Update on Dads Esophageal Cancer,"About a month ago or more we found out my dad was diagnosed with Esophageal Cancer. At that time we didn't know the stage or prognosis it was scary not knowing. It was an emotional rollercoaster to say the least. Then several weeks later after a CT scan, we were told it was  stage 2/3 adenocarcinoma because it had been found in two of his nearby lymph nodes. I thought okay that's not so bad. The team of doctors said 5 days of radiation and then chemo once a week until surgery. Well then another week goes by my dad has his endoscopic ultrasound to see the tumor depth. They find the tumor has grown through into outer muscle of his esophagus. 

 Two weeks ago on my birthday I get a text with results from my dad's ultrasound, my  mom says his cancer has been restaged to a 4! WTF?!  This time I am balling my eyes out. My dad's team of doctors adjust his treatment plan accordingly, 28 days of radiation plus one day of chemo per week for three hours. Then 6 weeks of rest and surgery in December. My dad goes to an appointment to talk about the surgery with his thoracic surgeon, he gets another bomb shell,  they are going to completely remove his esophagus and move his stomach up to basically take it's place. Two weeks in the hospital. He is already having difficulty swallowing and is eating less as a result. My mom has already modified his diet to fit with his eating issues and his loosing his will to eat because it is difficult for him. He cannot loose a drastic amount of weight. His doctors need him to eat to keep up his strength to make it through chemo and radiation.

 Today he started his treatment. I honestly wish they had started it weeks ago. I am scared he will not want to keep fighting especially when the chemo and radiation side effects kick in. They say everyone is different in how their bodies handle it. I pray my dad is strong enough and stubborn enough to push through the difficult days that will come.  I am grateful that my dad has a huge amount of support from his family. My aunt came to stay with mom to help her out when my dad starts to get sick from his treatments. This is easing my mind a bit that my mom has help and support when I can't be there because I live pretty far away. But now the battle has begun and I need my dad to step up to the plate and fight.

616,how do you address/handle the guilt associated with changes in lifestyle/plans for a loved one battle cancer?,"
Hi there! I have found out recently...well, the family found out, that our beloved mother is fighting stage 4 breast cancer that has spread to her pancreas and liver. The degree in which it is spread, I can't say I understood everything I was told as my older brother and dad are the dedicated medical info repeaters to keep our extended fam in the loop. This diagnosis came last week, though my mom had been going through some tests a few weeks before and I sensed something could be wrong.

Long story short, there are a lot of feelings in the air from everyone. Me, particularly, am the only sibling that lives outside of our home state of California. I grew up there but moved to NYC two years ago. I am currently not working , as I took time off to travel and live off of savings, but the topic has been approached of me moving back to help out as my older siblings have families of their own (though we've all been helping out with emotional support - esp grand kids keep my mom happy!). Me, on the other hand, I am a solo bird. No family of my own, youngest child growing up in the family, all that. 

I'm so saddened by this news of the cancer. What's worse is my mom feels guilty for making a ""burden"". In fact, the day before she officially found out, I had booked a multi continent solo trip and she insisted I still continue or else it would upset her if I changed my plans. This breaks my heart. Even at her worst, she puts others before herself.

A part of me thinks moving back home will help out. But a part of me is mourning also the loss of this life I built in New York City. Please excuse me for sounding petty and childish, perhaps even insensitive. I don't dare share these feelings outloud with the family but they are feelings I can't seem to get rid of. I feel like the ""right"" thing to do is to move. I'm in between jobs, and I've lived most of my life back in Cali so adjusting to life back there wouldn't be a problem. But on top of feeling sad for my mom, and my dad, and our family, I am feeling guilty FOR feeling sad to leave New York City.

My siblings having their own families, something that is ""theirs"". For me, i've never really had much I could call my own except for decisions and a life I've carved out for myself, esp starting over in NYC. Super cliche I know.

I feel extremely guilty for not wanting to leave NYC. And then I go into cycles where I wonder if things like that even matter. I should drop everything for the woman who raised our family, who never thinks twice to put her children ahead before herself. 

This may be more of a vent but feedback is appreciated. You can say I am selfish too, maybe that's it? Or is this disease simply the catalyst of an unplanned journey for everyone involved? Maybe these feelings are OK? I feel like I am mourning the loss of my mom, and our normal life as we know it. Our plans (collectively as a family and also individually, i.e. my parents living it up retirement lifestyle).

621,Cant find the words,"Not sure what my whole purpose is in talking about this but finding this page(?) makes me feel less alone with what I’m going through. This is probably going to be all over the place but it makes me feel better to hope that someone feels like reading all this. I apologize also if the punctuation and/or grammar isn’t on par.

My dad (66) and I (21 F) have never had the most ideal relationship. He suffered significant emotional, physical, and mental abuse from his parents his entire life and despite being nothing like him towards us, his temper and abusive words and tendencies have created tension and issues between us for years now to the point where I don’t really have conversations with him unless we both happen to be home or I need money for something (unfortunately). I can only imagine what he had to deal with during his child-adulthood living with them when he had because he still has very much open wounds from the treatment. He’s very stuck in his own ways and has a very “my way of the highway” attitude about literally anything. He’s been verbally and physically abusive towards my siblings and mom to the point where the cops have had to be called several times in the past, is extremely sensitive, and doesn’t like any kind of disrespect whether it’s intentional or not. In short, my relationship has been quite strained with him and my siblings and I generally rely on our mom for every other parental support. With all of that being said though, I wouldn’t trade him for anyone in the world. He’s extremely smart and was a very successful physician in his earlier years. Ironically though he has a very large distaste for the healthcare world as a whole. 

He was diagnosed with colon cancer in June of 2018 but unbeknownst to all of us, he’d actually had the tumor for well over 2 years before he bothered look further into what was going on. Up until May of 2020, other than counting for the days where he’d spend the days sleeping off his chemo and radiation treatments, he was fine. To us at least. He’d still run errands, drive himself around, handle all of the big bills in the house, he was working...And then he had the surgery. 

Almost immediately (the evening he got out of the surgery) it was clear my dad wasn’t prepared for the realistic recovery time from this operation. He’d never been operated on before and this was a 6 hour surgery to have a temporary Colostomy bag placed on him that we’d hoped would be removed in another 3 months after the surgery, things didn’t go as planned though. He was only supposed to be in the hospital for 4 days tops but he ended up being there 3 weeks, this is early June now because his surgery was on the 11th of May. When he finally came home the weight loss was very hard to miss. He’d gone from 185 lbs to what looked like 160, and my dads 5’10 so it was eerily noticeable. He only continued losing the weight after the fact.

Fast forward to July, he still hasn’t walked, is barely eating or even drinking, and my mom has become his primary care taker; feeding him, bathing him, sleeping on the couch to not have to disturb him but to still be able to hear him if he needs water or something, just everything. He’s now closer to 140 lbs and slowly losing more and more mobility and energy with every day he decides not to eat. He’s throwing up bile and blood, getting mini looking seizures, and had developed diabetes but hadn’t been taking his meds. He’d slipped into a full on depression and had pretty much given up on himself (he’s always struggled with on and off depression) while also refusing to get medical care. At this point it’s hard even coming upstairs to say hi or ask if he needs anything because the person I’m seeing and attempting to talk to looks nothing like the man that has watched me grow up.. he finally agreed to being taken to the hospital though on the 14th and since then there’s been slight improvements but not much. 

I went to see him in the hospital the 16th and the entire time all I could do was get him water when he asked, answer his random questions or statements that’d often have nothing to do with what was going on, and cry silently as I watched him writhe in pain and shake as he tried drinking his own water. It was only when I was about to leave when he looked at me, smiled, and told me how beautiful I’d grown up to be. I’m crying as I type this now because that’s probably the first and only time I’ll ever hear him say that... It hurts seeing him in pain and knowing there’s nothing I can do to reverse time and take away this fucking disease, it hurts feeling like I’m probably going to walk down the aisle without him when I’m married, it hurts envisioning his absence at my graduation, it hurts knowing he probably won’t be able to be repaid for all he’s done for me and taught me... I can’t even think about how my mom has been able to handle everything. The last update I heard his BP is low enough for him to slip into hypertension and possibly a coma and that his tumor has now metastasized to his liver. I’m terrified of losing my dad...

622,I lost my wife today,"A few months ago, she was let go from her job and in the middle of the fight with the school board, she got her diagnosis. As if the job loss didn't already upset her, she was diagnosed with stage 3b colon cancer. She has been getting more depressed as the days go by. 

And today, on Christmas, in front of our young kids, my wife announced that she was leaving us. She said she was thankful to spend Christmas with us, but now that it's done, she doesn't want to be a burden to us anymore. She doesn't want the children to see her getting more sick. 

No matter what I said, or the children crying, she refused to listen. She already had two bags packed, and she walked out. I am completely lost and shocked and heart broken. I don't know where she's going... she won't answer her phone.  I tried calling the cops and they told me that since she left on her own, there's nothing they can do. I'm going to keep checking the bank account to see if she's buying anything anywhere. 

 The kids and I are just so confused. 

UPDATE: She withdrew $1000 from a bank branch this morning. While she has money to survive, she just made us short on money for the mortgage and other debts. I'm hoping my parents can help with that.

623,Cancer is back. I’m so frustrated. Kind words please.,"If you’ve seen any of my posts before then you know the whole story, but just in case: I was diagnosed with cervical cancer in June 2015, went through 8 months of chemo, internal/external radiation and was in remission come February 2016. The cancer came back May 2017 in my abdominal lymph nodes. I had surgery then more chemo and radiation but it was unsuccessful. I found that out in February 2018. My doctor actually told me that I had 6 months or less to live, that I should go home and get ready. As a last Hail Mary they tested my tumor for a specific protein that immunotherapy could help. I was a GREAT candidate, so I decided to go on that route. I started on Keytruda (an immunotherapy) in April 2018 and have been on it ever since. My initial CT showed that 3 of 4 tumors were gone and that there was a mass but it hadn’t grown at all. My doctor told me he suspected that it wasn’t even live cancer tissue and that, although we’d need a PET scan to be sure, I may very well be in remission again. I found that out in December 2018 and it was truly a Christmas miracle.  

Well, I just had my PET scan last week and got the results today. There’s a new tumor in yet another abdominal lymph node that, while still small, seems to be growing despite the regular doses of Keytruda. My doctor said that there’s nothing to do at the moment. We’ll just have another scan in a couple of months and see. He also told me that we knew the treatment was working but it was never guaranteed for how long. He actually called the report “a mixed bag” because my prior tumors have all disappeared. But this new one is small, 1.8 cm x 1.1 cm. I don’t know how to feel really. I’m disappointed but I don’t want to let on that I’m scared. My fiancé and my family have all been really supportive through everything, and we all had finally gotten used to the good news that I wasn’t going to die any time soon. But now this.  

I guess I just wanted to say it (er.... write it) aloud and keep you guys updated. Send me some love. I’m scared.

624,I can’t believe he might actually die.,"So it feels like we are nearing the end. My brother keeps sending me symptoms of the final days in a cancer patient and my father had every single one. He hasn’t eaten since Sunday other that 2 small bowls of soup. Hasn’t been able to get all his pills in, barely any liquid. He’s delirious, extremely fatigued, confused. If you’ve seen my previous posts, I’ve been complaining that he’s been a difficult patient, but I can’t believe it really is happening yanno. He went through all this just to suffer severely for the last 6 months of life and to turn into an asshole so our last memories of him are negative? Damn, what a system. I guess he was being a dick to make his passing seem easier, help us detach? People gave me the advice to detach when they start this bad attitude and refuse the help they need, so I’ve been trying. He has made it easier. I know it’s not easy. It’s not going to be easy. I’m going to cry a shit ton. I can’t help but he upset about all these medications. Like this is the fault of 20 medications. How could any human survive on this list of medications? Being in this sub, I know many of you are going through and have gone through similar things so my heart goes out to you all. Even those if different situations. Bottle line, this is all fucked up. Do I prepare for his death? Do I call 911? All he says is.. no matter what, I’m not going back to the hospital. The side effects of some of these medications are anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts. Is this the medications fault?

627,Husband Caregiver Feeling Lonely,"My wife is battling Stage 4 Metastatic Breast cancer since 2016. She's strong and determined to keep up with her daily treatments. As the chemotherapy pills do their job destroying her cells to prevent tumor growth it's also destructive to her body. I love and support her 100%. I am by her side when I am not working. Lately i've been dealing with depression and feeling alone. I have made an appointment to speak with a mental health therapist; I recognize that is severely needed. My current struggle is feeling stuck in ""Caregiver Mode"". Daily conversations with my wife are mostly about pain, discomfort, anxiety, sadness, fear and anger. I am very cognizant of how I have no idea of what she's feeling or going through. I purposely shift the focus to more positive aspects of life in an attempt keep us from going into a downward mood. After 2 1/2 years, I am finding myself in my own downward spiral. Feeling lonely but not alone, I am married and in love with my wife. Intimacy is sporadic when she feels guilty. I struggle to mentally bypass seeing her as a cancer patient. When we are successful the guilt is overwhelming watching her hold back the pain despite lubrication. All of this has resulted in my becoming more withdrawn and she's noticing. I feel as if I suffering in silence then remind myself; mine is nothing compared to hers. Guilt for feeling this way manifests followed by anger for being selfish. Crying alone happens next, then fighting with myself to stop. Telling myself this not my time to break down. I then find the strength to become engaged and actively love and support my wife. Looking back I realized, I am stuck in a cyclical pattern; basically rinse and repeat.

630,Quit Chemo,"One week ago my fiance was supposed to receive a round of chemo. Unfortunately, his oncologist recommended that he stop chemo and focus on palliative care. She said it as kindly and concisely as she could to a roomful of his loved ones (his mother, step-father, father, aunt and myself). 

It wasn't the news we were hoping to hear but, after conferring with the radialogist regarding his brain scan results, the oncologist said that there was no point in continuing chemo to treat the tumors in his other body parts when the cancer in his brain was not manageable. She said that he had days or weeks but not months. We all cried and hugged each other. 

The whole day was like a dream afterwards. The future I pictured for us was shattered. My fiance was kept for a few hours to get fluids into him because he was dehydrated and I drove us home after. Throughout it all he still refused to give up. Other than our initial cry session in the doctor's office he showed no other worry about the results. I asked him on the ride back home what his thoughts were and he insisted that he would still beat it. I didn't have the heart to do anything but agree and I still don't. 

Two days later we were packing up and heading to his father's beach house for some rest and relaxation. Two days after that it was decided that we would stay here from here on out and that I would receive some help with the caregiver duties (after his older brother walked an hour in my shoes when I had a particularly hard day involving several dirty adult diapers and called him for help). 

Now, he is snoring away in a hospital bed in his father's livingroom after a full day of festivities. However many days he has left I'm making it my mission for him to enjoy every single one.

I have always believed in natural treatments and prevention and have always disagreed with western medicine and their practices. It looks like my dad is literally in hell and I just don’t know how long a human should do this. It seems like cruel and unusual punishment to me. They’re saying even if everything goes 100% perfect and he does get better, recovery could be 2 years only to provide him another 3 years tops. Plus some of the issues he is dealing with could be permanent so he is just trading in one sickness for another. Is this worth it!?! Maybe something is wrong with my brain and my perspective, but imagining him going through this for the next few years just does not click in my head.

Maybe this is the way I was raised or my family dynamic, I don’t know. I just want to be clear headed and a good person, but my family has never been close. My dad has been single and living alone for a very long time so all he has is the damaged relationships with my brothers and myself. All three of us are there as often as possible and I quit my job to be his full time caregiver... but I can’t do this job for YEARS. This is AWFUL!!!!! Every day is awful and of course even more awful for my poor father. Does the fact that I’m not willing to sacrifice years of my life make me a bad person? So what.. he fights this for a year and then moves into a nursing home? What if he can’t function or live on his own again?

634,Father passed,"About 26 months ago, my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer. We caught it early, and he was doing good. Unfortunately, hindsight reveals things got worse last year when it migrated to one of his vertebrae. Back in February, he had a form of spinal surgery after said vertebrae collapsed. He went to rehab for two months, came home, and was doing good until he had a stroke in June. Back to rehab for that for a month, he came back home. We had various physical and occupational therapists from the VNA (Visiting Nurses Association) come by to help him with various forms of therapy. I moved back in with my parents from my dorm to help my parents last week. On Tuesday this week, the physical therapist suggested he go to the hospital after a PT session because his oxygen levels were low and blood pressure was high, which the doctors where reasonably certain was pneumonia. Doing good until early yesterday morning he had what the doctors called a massive stroke, and my mom and I started planning for the end. That came just about an hour ago. My mom spent the night at the hospital while I came home to hold down the fort.

636,F. Brain cancer,This morning I woke up to find my mother in law laying on the floor wearing my pants and peeing herself. I'm not mad. She had no idea what she was doing. But (can I cuss I really want to cuss a lot)  seriously this is hard! My siblings in law are more concerned with cleaning the house and taking whatever possessions they want. I feel like I'm the only one who cares how she is doing and making sure she is loved in her last few weeks.  I would rather they just left and let me handle it all but they have to have control.

637,caregiver stress,"Hi everyone. My aunt( 72 years old) was diagnosed 6 months ago with small cell lung cancer with metastases to the liver and lymph nodes(stage 4). Doctor gave her 6 months to live without treatment and 8 with. Now my aunt is terrified of anything that has to do with hospitals and doctors and needles and everything medicine related so she never got herself checked out. She never got married so never had children either.

She was started on chemotherapy and she did 4 rounds with good results showing that the tumors she had, had shrunk and others were so small that they weren't visible or were completely gone. Then sh\*t hit the fan: She had a cold and they put her on antibiotics but then the antibiotics did nothing so she had to take other antibiotics. Her cold went away but she had a heart attack in december, which means that she had gone 2 and a half months without treatment. Her doctor told us that she needs to get a ct scan of her head, thorax(lungs & heart), upper and lower abdomen. Turns out that during those 2 and a half months without treatment cancer had a party and some tumors grew again and now she even has a new one in her right lung. Her doctor decided no more chemo so now he started her on immunotherapy.

Last weekend(around the 17th) she developed a cough so I had a doctor come to the house because my aunt is scared sh\*tless of hospitals and since my father died of cancer in 2012 she hadn't seen the inside of a hospital until August when she had to stay in the hospital for 2 weeks. He gave her 10ml of dexamethasone and tomorrow I have to get her to the hospital for immunotherapy(once every 21 days).

My aunt even without her diagnoses is a horrible human being. Last year she wouldn't even give water to our other dying aunt. She's extremely mean and constantly insults you and she makes the type of jokes that nobody would even consider them to be a joke if they heard them. I can't stand being here any more. I gave up my life for the past 6 months to take care of her and not even a kind word or a thank you. 

My brother recently got married and became a father, my cousin lives on an island with her family so I can't expect any help from her and my other cousin also has a family and works 13 hours a day so I'm basically on my own. My cousin who lives an hour away, doesn't even call. The last time he called was for Christmas. His sister the last time she called to check in on our aunt called somewhere in late August/ early September.  My brother does visit us at least once or twice a week and brings food sometimes and calls every day.

I do everything for my aunt since I live in her house: cook, clean, bathe her, pay her bills, take her to doctor's appointments and her therapy, find doctors to come to the house to check her out. My only break from her is when I go shopping for food or coffee to bring back to the house. I can't stand this much longer. I've had more than enough and the end is nowhere in sight. I don't know if a job will be waiting for me when I go back to my city since the last time I worked was in August. I'm 35 years old and am completely isolated. I have no friends here. I also have to deal with her f\*cked in the head neighbour who thinks that I'm isolating my aunt from her because she doesn't get the fact that it's f\*cking flu season and my aunt even with the flu shot she had, has a weak immune system and a simple cold can kill her but no I'm the asshole here. My aunt also used to buy her neighbour cigarettes and give her money from time to time so since I've been staying with her and since I haven't allowed her visiting my aunt she hasn't been getting any money. I could write a book but I guess that's all for now...If you want leave me a comment here or message me so time passes by a little bit faster.",3.0,"['caregiver', 'stress', 'everynumber', 'famrel',

638,I’m tired.,"Hi. I’ve posted here before several times. My tumor’s been growing since November and I’ve been an even worse nervous wreck than usual ever since. 

Life updates (in stream of consciousness [?] form):

- I just had another MRI on Monday that I don’t know the results of. 
- I’ll likely be able to do another 10-15 doses of radiation, according to Dr. Gardner.
- I’ve had nightmares about my tumor spreading to my brain stem. I start to dissociate and/or feel sick every time I walk into a hospital, see/hear anything associated with an MRI machine, or think about calling my doctors/getting a phone call from them. I very recently started using CBD oil and that helps with the anxiety some. I think I might have PTSD.
- My New York visits are now every six weeks. 
- I desperately want to have surgery at some point. I want more time. I NEED more time.
- I’ve got a new therapist. I see him again tomorrow.
- My mom’s looking for a better job. 
- I applied for and got SSI in less than 2 weeks. 
- I received a dream from my local Dream Factory chapter that just got fulfilled. I’m turning 19 later this month (March), so it had to happen before now. I got a shopping spree to redo my bedroom because I’ve never had a nice, beautiful bedroom w/new furniture. We could never afford it. My stepdad is helping me put the furniture together now. 

I’m in hell, but I’m lucky enough to still be here, so that counts for something.

641,New tumor. Feeling hopeless.,"Hi,
To preface: My Fiancé has a non hodgkins lymphoma that is a Subtype of Diffuse Large B Cell called Primary Mediastinal B Cell Lymphoma. Diagnosed in august 2017 with a tumor the size of a softball pressing on his heart and Lung. 
We were all thinking his post chemo PET scan was going to be great. After 1 round of RCHOP Alec's tumor was decreased by 70%. After round 4 it was decreased by like 90% and was likely just scar tissue. PET after 6th round showed the original mass most likely dead (SUV of 2.2) and a new mass to the left of his heart the size of a cherry tomato (high activity and SUV of 9.9) 
Doc let us know he needs R-ICE and BEAM + SCT and that his chances have decreased by 30%. 
I feel like someone sucker punched me. I feel like there is a very real chance I will have to live without the love of my life. He means more to me than anyone. He is my best friend. We are so young and no one  understands and just says ""dont worry he will live and make it through this"" and I know they mean well but what if he doesn't?? I'm just supposed to live without the best person I have ever met??? this isnt fucking fair. I am so scared of what is to come. What if he gets an infection when his white count is low? What if he gets sepsis and dies? what if all this chemo fucks up his organs and he dies of something else? My mind is spinning and for the first time since this all started. I feel like I am going to lose him. I looked at him today and I tried to remember the exact way he looked in the sunlight in the car on the way home. Thinking to myself; I never know which moments with him are my last. Feeling pretty broken. Sorry for ranting.

644,The end,"This is a different take to a lot of the posts here and I apologise if it takes the wrong tone for what is intended but I am currently struggling with a situation and I need to vent.

It's not me that is going through the cancer but my stepfather. He might not be my biological father but he has been in my life for as long as I can remember and he has probably been one of the most positive influences in my life.

In February of this year he was diagnosed with an operable bowel cancer (no symptoms, just went in because a friend had bowel cancer). 3 days later he was in surgery and it was removed (quick shout out to the medical staff at St Vincent's Hospital) and was given a scan to verify it hadn't progressed. 5 days later he was informed it had metastased to his liver and he had 2 months with no chemo or up to 12 with. Fast forward to 16 days ago when the doctors gave him 2-14 days and I rushed home from my holiday in Europe.

My dads wish was to pass away at home so for the last 8 days I have been feeding him, administering medication, bathing him, and helping him relieve himself. For the last 48 hours he has been unable to speak or awake unless I move him to change his nappy.

My post isn't to highlight how fucking horrible this disease is but rather to vent about how he wasn't given the legal option to take his own life at a time of his choosing with the level of dignity we would all like. It has been consistent medication, confusion, embarrassment, and humiliation for him and I do not understand what we as a society are afraid of when it comes to death.

I will be calling and writing to my local member of parliament to remind them of the impact their decisions have on ordinary families and encourage him to push this agenda.

My most genuine and sincere apologies to anyone who reads this and it brings up negative emotions as that is the last thing I want to do.

For those of you with cancer or supporting someone with cancer, please keep up the good fight and as always FUCK CANCER!

645,My dad has stage 4 melanoma and I regret not being able to give him grandkids...,My dad was misdiagnosed for about 2 to possibly 3 years. For 2 of those years he was going weekly to a doctor because of a toenail fungus. My dad went each week and they just told him it was nothing and to come back next week. They checked several times for cancer on the toe and then one day after two years it finally popped up as stage 3 melanoma. Went on immunotherapy for about a year to find out it did nothing to stop the spread of the cancer and has passed into the blood and his liver. I am an only child to my dad and mom. I am a 22 year old guy still in college and never had a major relationship. My one regret is that I want to give my dad grand kids before he passes but I am not ready yet. This may be his last Christmas and I am hating myself for not finishing college on time and not being able to have him there for my wedding and children whenever they may come.

646,"Yep, it’s cancer","TL;DR - got cancer, it sucks, it hurts, what should I do?

It’s been ... not great for the past weeks. Biopsy came back and my oncologist was spot on: myxoid liposarcoma, stage IV, already tiny bits in the spinal connectivity tissue (not the proper spine?).

It’s been a few days. Diagnosis was delayed because trying to get the radiation mapping done took forever because it hurt the absolute living shit out of me. Finally, I had to refuse treatment again, and the radiologist said we should focus on other avenues of treatment.

Only thing that makes me mad is that we had a clear plan on breaking out the pain meds to get me to the end, like planned to the minute, and none of the radiology team followed through. This was Friday evening, so haven’t had a chance to talk to them about it, but do you all think it’s something to pursue?

Also now have a really big cavity in the back of my thigh, near to where my tumor was/is, oozing lots of blood, not bleeding out, just oozing. They’re keeping it stuffed with gauze right now. Needs to be changed at least twice a day; doesn’t *hurt*, but is rather unpleasant. And also prevents me from continuing my chemo. So now that’s sitting in the back of my head and pit of my stomach.

Emotionally, I think I’m doing OK. Need to make some plans, want to visit with extended family and old friends, but stupid dumb virus is screwing that up. One thing I want to do is setup something for my two nieces, no idea what it would look like, but a couple of presents or something in the mail every year, birthday and Christmas? Don’t know if there’s something like that on the Internet.

By the time my doctors could find out what as going on, it had already exited my thigh and ""landed"" in my spinal column. One part in particular, the L5, was enlarged enough to seem to block at least some of the treatment, so my doctors tried to focus on shrinking that tumor in particular to alleviate the massive amount of pain I have experienced. My doctors' have determined that shrinking the L5 via radiation is not the best path to go on, and will be meeting on Monday to determine a better way.

Also I have already done two rounds of chemo, one on ATM, the latest on trabectedine. Three more I think? Latest plan was to continue on with the trabectedine, but that might have changed.

At the same time, in the back upper part of my thigh, a cavity developed that won’t embolize. So far, the only way to stop the bleed has been to wipe out the cavity, then stuff it with kerlix gauze and the put in a few sutures or tape to hold it together.

I know that I probably don’t have a lot of time, and I need to start making plans for visiting family and friends for the last time, right? But I can’t do that with this thigh thing hanging over me. So, what can I do?

Please people of Reddit, help me.

649,My dad passed away,"My dad passed away Tuesday morning just after midnight. Exactly 6 months into the year. 6 months after the stage 4 diagnosis. It was in his prostate and spread to the lymph system and bones. He fought so hard to the absolute last second. 

It was so peaceful and it happened exactly the way he would have wanted. In his home, hooked up to no machines, with my sister and my mom, the only woman he has ever loved though they have been divorced 20 years, holding his hand. I said my goodbyes and told him I would be in the other room as it happened. I know it happened and I know it’s real. But I still feel like I need someone to make sure. 

I haven’t cried as much as I thought. Going back to his house, the house I was brought home to after I was born and grew up in, was comforting. He was suffering so badly. But I just miss him so much. I know these are normal feelings of grief but I just can not believe he is gone. Talking about it helps for now. I have moments of anger. I just don’t know what to do with myself. 

I’m a daddy’s girl. Always have been. We just understood each other and he was a man that was not understood by many. He was a loner and liked it that way (his words). But he loved his daughters so much. He taught me everything. I am impressed by what I’ve accomplished because he was pushing the bike the whole time once the training wheels were off.

655,I hate the fact that I just joined this forum... but I need to blow some steam.,"Cancer has been horrible. My mom was just diagnosed with Stage 4 Breast last week, after ignoring a lump for 3 f*cking years. Both my dad and her have been in denial about the growth for a longggg time, and the only way I could get actually get her to go to the Doctors was by threatening to call 911 and have her escorted there. I was about the burn house down.

Anyways... after a few days of some serious grieving and the typical wave of emotions one goes through when they come to terms with the finiteness of the humans they love—I’m coping by researching, I think in a healthy way? I’m researching success stories, diet and nutrition, ways we can now treat it and prevent it from getting worse. I want to SAVE my mom, and I have hope we CAN at least make this easier through the power of knowledge and positive outlook!!! No matter what happens!!!!!

However, I’m the only one in my family who is coming at it like this. My little brother, mom and dad are ALL acting like this is an automatic death sentence, and she’s already dead. I’m trying not to let it anger me, I just desperately want to convince them otherwise and get my mom on a healthier diet, have the house inspected for mold, get a water filter... nothing too extravagant, I don’t think??? 

Problem is, I know I can’t help my mom alone. It has to be a team effort, and ultimately has to be her decision... and I think she’s coming around. But my dad has been awful to me. He can’t stand hearing my positivity, my suggestions, or the resources I’m trying to show them. I know he’s stressed and scared and just angry with himself for letting it go for years and is displacing it all and pointing fingers at me... But it’s been horrible. I’ve only ever known him as a kind, loving and supportive father towards me and today we talked on the phone after going over some mold inspections plans (which he doesn’t want to do) and told me I “would be a terrible doctor” (a life aspiration of mine) and that I have been “the source of all his stress in this.” It cut me like a knife, because that’s the opposite of what I’ve been trying to do for everyone.

I hardly EVER feel anger... but right now I just feel like I’ll never be able to look at my dad the same, if I’ll even be able to look at him at all. 

I guess right now I’m just asking for some encouragement, BECAUSE THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST THING IVE EVER EXPERIENCED AND I WOULDN’T WISH THIS ON MY WORST ENEMY. I’m desperate to hear from someone who can relate, or just get some kind of resource that can help me navigate all of this, because obviously it’s not going to be my mom or dad this time.

657,"""Currently, you no longer have cancer cells in your body"" is one of the best news I've ever heard in my life!","I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer stage 2b and a rare cancer, pseudomyxoma peritonei, last year. Having cancer at a young age, or at any age for that matter, is an awful experience.

I was afraid of surgery but I had no choice but to undergo a major one to remove my right ovary, appendix, some omentum & lymph nodes. I have also just finished with my chemotherapy this year.

And when my doctor told me, ""Currently, you no longer have cancer cells in your body,"" I wanted to cry.

F*ck cancer! It ruined my life. I don't understand other people who say ""cancer is a gift."" No way! Cancer will never be a gift. Or maybe it is, but it is a bad gift. I have missed so many opportunities because of it. And the COVID-19 pandemic makes it worse. I still can't go back to my usual life. 

But hearing the phrase, ""you no longer have cancer"" makes me feel invincible again. Although there is still a risk that cancer might recur. 

I am very grateful to my supportive family & friends. If not for them, I would be suffering more. I am also indebted to the medical team for their support. 

I hope everyone here who has cancer will also hear the beautiful words, ""you no longer have cancer.""

658,Everybody is telling me that the hard part is almost over but I still feel like the world is about to fall apart (long post- I don’t know where else I can put this),"
I am 21, my fiancé-to-be (24) has a nonseminomas retroperitoneal  germ cell tumor at stage IIIB.  His tumor was the size of a cantaloupe before treatment, pressing on tons of nerves, and they originally thought it was starting to wrap around his aorta (it wasn't thankfully).
The month he was diagnosed I was about to sign a lease to an apartment and he was about to make a 630 mile move to live with me. I live in Pennsylvania but have spent a little over a year in North Carolina being the sole caregiver to my partner outside of of the occasional ride to the hospital from his father.
He was misdiagnosed for around five months and the doctors told us that had he not started the treatment when he did he would have been dead within a month- the cancer was very close to spreading to his lungs and brain. I still don’t understand how they know that and have been to terrified to ask and worry about the “what ifs” for his cancer.
After four five day cycles of cisplatin and etoposide over four months he was scheduled for a Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in February of this year. His team told me to go homes, and start planning our lives together, the hard part was over, he was stable.
I started college and took a week off to go and be with him the week of surgery.
His tumor markers skyrocketed in between this last round of chemo and the surgery... So I went on medical leave and again became his sole caregiver.
Three rounds of carboplatin and etoposide each round followed by autologous stem cell transplants. As of two days ago he had his RPLND surgery and they were able to remove the whole tumor without needing to do valve replacement or reroute anything like his team had anticipated needing to do. The tumor was the size of a baseball after all the treatment according to his surgeon. They were able to remove all the lymph nodes and entire tumor.
We get the pathology report back in a week to start figuring out the next steps.
Today was the first day in well over a year he was in unbearable pain in his back and abdomen and he was able to get up and move to the chair, is hungry, and drinking all things vital to his recovery. I am ecstatic for him, how well he did and he's not as terrified now. His father tried to tell him he was cancer free now but I corrected him. The tumor his gone but the doctors have Not told him or even mentioned him being cancer free at this point in time... He told me he wants to move and just pretend all of this was just a horrible dream which would be nice! I am working with his team to coordinate with a transplant center where I live so he can get his shots, labs, scans, and other appointments he needs without having to travel back and forth every few months.
The tumor may be gone and his pain is much better but everything in me is still bracing for the next thing and every older adult I have spoken to told me that likely will not fade until he hits the five year mark. I am exhausted. I love this man more than anything in the world and dropped out of my life twice to do everything in my power to help him through this but I am SO TIRED. Tired and sad and angry at everything even though it was nobody's fault.

660,How do I help my family watch me die?,"I'm 36 years old, mother to a beautiful 5-month-old baby girl, loving wife of nearly 12 years to my amazing husband and soulmate, and I've just recently been diagnosed with colon cancer that has spread everywhere. And I do mean everywhere: my brain, spine, lungs, ovaries, liver...there's nowhere it hasn't touched.  The only symptoms I had were a slightly sore back and narrower stool. There's nothing the doctors can do, and I have only weeks or days to live. 

Somehow I've been coping semi-okay...at times feeling something like a peace that passes all understanding (though also at times feeling futile anger and sometimes even hope that I'll be miraculously healed, even though I know it's not rational). I've written letters goodbye to my loved ones, made arrangements for after I'm gone, and in general feel ""okay"" about what will happen after my death (despite feeling immense and inexpressible sadness that I won't be there to watch my beautiful baby girl and my amazing nephew grow up and to take care of my husband and family. But that's not the plan for my life, so I have to accept it and move on.)

What I'm having a REALLY hard time with is how my parents and husband and sister will handle my actual dying part. I know that once I'm gone it will be terribly difficult for them (we're all such a close-knit family), but I won't be around to help them deal with that, and just have to trust that God and family and friends will see them through. What I will be around for (presumbly, if I'm not completely unconscious) is watching them deal with my actual death process. My wonderful mom was a nurse for 41 years and my mother-in-law is also a retired nurse, and they want to take care of me as I die at home with the help of hospice. My mom has seen MANY people die in her line of work, but I know that watching her own daughter go through the process will be immeasurably more difficult. And of course my darling husband will take it extremely hard too. :( 

Is there anything I can do to make this whole dying process easier on them? I've read about the things that hospice provides and the care that's required at the end-of-life, and it's terrifying. Oh how I wish I could just pass away peacefully tonight in my sleep!!! Why can't euthanasia be a legal option? I'd so much rather take it than allow my loved ones to suffer needlessly, with no hope. I'm sorry this post is so negative. I don't want my last thoughts and actions on this earth to be that way. But it's unbelievable and incredibly ironic that just five months ago my mom, mother-in-law, and husband were in the delivery room with me while I was in pain waiting for my gorgeous daughter to be born. Now they will have to watch me die, and will get no bundle of joy out of the deal--only a dead daughter and a dead wife. I just wish that I could somehow spare them this.

663,Stage IV Colon Cancer w/Mets - Ouch,"It has been a week since my Lower Anterior Resection (LAR). It was supposed to be Laparoscopic but the Ghost of Christmas Future visited my surgeon the night before and he decided we were doing the Full Monty.

So now I am dealing with 20 staples in my belly, a drain, and a poop bag. I must admit I am a big fan of the epidural. Other than the fact my left thigh was uselessly numb. But that stood me in good stead as they kept sticking me with heparin and I couldn't feel it.

But OMG the food. No wonder 20% of cancer patients starve to death. On the 3rd day after surgery the meal was so bad I burst into tears (which hurts like a mother fucker with staples in your belly). 

Then I called my favorite restaurant near the hospital and the boss ran me up my dinner. I hugged and cried on him too.

But I did get to leave on the 4th day. The poor weekend doctor came in to examine me to see if I was able to go home. I was dressed, packed and waiting for my T3 prescription to be written. That young fella had quite a funny look on his face but didn't attempt to stand in my way.

I couldn't understand why my nether regions felt like the aftermath of an '80s orgy but apparently, I got a bonus colonoscopy and lady bits exam. Yeah, me.

But the good news is Artie the Ass Tumor is no more. He was completely encapsulated and hadn't gone where he shouldn't.  Plenty of margins so my poop bag is temporary (and not as bad as you would think - don't be scared of it just don't eat hard-boiled eggs).

While the surgeon was in there he took a look-see at Larry the Liver who was looking great. The Daryll Tumors are still there of course but you couldn't tell by looking.

6 more weeks and we do it all again. Wheeee!!!

665,Cancer Survivor or Not?,"Hi,
I don't know where to start, so I will make it short:
was born with optic nerve glioma. Got chemo for a while. It helped, but the tumor was inoperable due to his location direct at the optic nerve (so he's still kinda there, but veeeery small and inactive, dead?).
Had to go to MRT and some other stuff ever year for 19 years.

Now I am 19 years old and fortunately the disease didn't come back, but recently I wanted to gain more information about it, because my parents and I didn't and don't speak much about it.

I found out that only malignant tumors are called cancer (mine was *benign*).
So I am totally confused, angry, and sad(?) right now.

All the years I thought that I had cancer. I identified myself as a cancer survivor and I was proud of it.
It helped me through hard times, to motivate myself again. And now I found out that it wasn't cancer?!?wtf...

Don't get me wrong: I am really happy that I ""only"" had a benign tumor instead of a malignant one and I know that benign ones can also be very dangerous and life-threatening/-changing.

So: Are tumor survivors considered cancer survivors or are they their own thing?
I don't get it...

666,Cancer is about to win,"As I mentioned in other posts my dad has metastatic kidney cancer and was just put in hospice care 9 days ago. He thought he would have at least 6 more months and was active and just like himself. His cancer spread to his lungs where it rapidly took over. Friday night he started acting out of it and Saturday he stopped eating or drinking anything.  He has been sleeping since Sunday only to wake up confused and hospice said he is in the active dying phase so I’ve been sitting in the home I grew up in just watching him.  When I got here and went to tell him hi and I’m here for him he didn’t even know who I was. I am not ready to lose him.  He has been there for me my whole life and I feel like there’s nothing I can do for him. I am exhausted and haven’t been able to sleep but 4 hours since Sunday.

667,Metastasize Already!,"I (F47) been my father's (M66) caregiver now for 2 years 8 months.  He has a rare cancer (Angiosarcoma - a 1% kind of cancer) and of the rareness of the cancer it is 1% of the group that has it on his face.

Jan 2017 was his diagnosis, then chemo until Jul where his heart was damaged (bundle branch block) and neuropathy became too much, so they stopped it. In December they started another chemo and within 2 weeks of his first infusion he was in the hospital with no white blood count.  January 2018 they decide to move to radiation and that started in March and finished in May when he said no more.  

So while the chemo and radiation helped keep it at bay (too invasive for surgery before or after these treatments to remove any of the tumours), the tumours are now quite active and he has leaking wounds in his face (brow, both cheeks, nose and now a new one which has bored it's way from cheek into his mouth.  He also appears now to have sores across his bottom gums (he has no teeth).  Add to that, that in January/March he had cataract surgery and then and three weeks ago he required a cornea transplant which has been another complication in his life.

All of this to say...he's an angry, depressed, very pessimistic man.  Back in March I almost told him to leave (he lives with me) as I could not deal with him anymore (my first post here).  In April, 1 week after coming back from a Cuba vacation with my sister, I did tell him to get out.  The support system we have here in Ontario (LINH support) was tried to find him a place to stay but during their search he changed his mind (though I didn't remember asking him too, lol).

End of  May one morning as I am just about to go to work he tells me he definitely wants to go to a Long-Term Care facility and I tell him okay, he should call his support worker and then he freaks out asking me why he should have to do that (um, you're a 67 year old man who can use a phone?)...but I do that for him.  This ends with him being admitted to the hospital as he tells them that he wants out of my home because he cannot care for himself anymore (forgets when to take medications, etc - but in reality he doesn't forget he was actually mad as they had just changed his meds and there were even 'more' pills) and so he stayed there for a week.

After putting himself there, wouldn't you know it, that night I get a call that he doesn't want to be there, he knows nothing, they won't talk to him, etc.  This call happened every day, sometimes twice and he wanted to go home, but they were not having it.  What they were trying to do was get his medications under control and see what worked, what didn't, etc.  He was released a week later, his medications are now bubble packaged to help him remember if he has or has not taken them etc.  Meanwhile, LINH support was still trying to find a place for him and they come out talk to him about some options and he decides he doesn't want to go there and he's staying.

It's now August...his wounds leak around the clock - he is understandably upset about it, his eyes (which were never the same after radiation) are not playing nice (cornea transplant one is still healing and almost sewn shut to help) and he's just been so negative that I really just want the cancer to move from his face and hit somewhere that will kill him.  I know that sounds so bad and evil, but when you hear your father say he just wants to end it...constantly (just heard it 15min ago when helping him with his eye drops), I just want it to be over. 

He's angry all the time that no one is doing anything for him (he has a daily nurse visit!), but he doesn't associate his wounds with his cancer which astounds me.  I try to calmly talk to him that they really cannot do anything if he's not opting for treatment...palliative is where he placed himself and it is only going to get worse. I am just so tired.  I love my father, I do, but this man has been like a child instead of father to me off and on since my early 20s with one mental or health situation after the other. 

Thank you for listening.

TL:DR I've been my father's caregiver for almost 3 years and his constant complaining, negativity and grumpiness is killing me and I want it to end.",3.0,"['metastasize', 'already', 'fdigit', 'been',

668,Dad just died,"Hepatocellular carcinoma, with the perfect storm of kidney and heart disease. He was diagnosed with the cancer in July. Brought him home with hospice in mid December. It finally got to be too much for him. I am sitting with him now waiting for the funeral home to come and take him. The hospice nurse fixed his face so he looks like he is peacefully napping. I’ve been waiting for this moment for a month by his side and now that it’s here it’s fucking surreal. It’s just me and dad and his dog and cat who are both so sad it’s painful. Can’t believe I’ll never see him again after they take him.

I am having surgery to remove the large tumors in my lungs and that will more than likely be it. 

I haven't had a good night's sleep in 3 years and the pain is becoming unmanageable without zombie inducing pain killers.

678,My dad has cancer and I am so worried,"I am 23 years of age and my dad has been diagnosed with throat cancer that has spread to his lymph node on one side of his face. He did radiotherapy for 2 weeks of a 6 week treatment whereby it was considered too dangerous in the UK to have chemo so they were going to try without. They’re worried his lymph node cancer is getting bigger so they have said they want him to do Chemo and is booked in from Thursday onwards. My understanding is that the radiation was focussed on his primary throat cancer which had yet to change in size in 2 weeks.I am really feeling numb about this all and I just want him to be okay. My mum is crying a lot and I just want to know, is there anything I can do? I make him cups of tea and glasses of water all day and I try to talk to him as much as I can as I am worried his throat cancer. Or even has anyone ever gone through something similar?

680,Almost a Year After My Sister's Diagnosis,"As I've been trying to figure out my travel plans to go home for Thanksgiving, I've realized I don't want to. Part of the reason is that I have finals the next week, but that's not really the issue. I can work at my parent's house – there's plenty of space for me to find a quiet corner and study. I don't want to go because last year, as I was packing to go home for Thanksgiving is when we found out about sister's cancer diagnosis. I called my mom trying to figure out what exactly I needed to pack and she just blurted it out in the first minutes of our call, ""your sister has cancer. She's a year older than me, diagnosed with breast cancer at 24 and within 3 months was classified as stage 4.

I don't want to go home for Thanksgiving because I don't want the reminder. The reminder of fear, hopelessness, and of the time where I had to be there for everyone. I allowed and encouraged my parents and sister to lean on me in ways I couldn't handle, especially two weeks before final exams. I allowed myself to be driven into the ground trying to hold everyone's feelings for them.

I don't want to go back this year and really feel like I can't if I want to stay focused on my exams.

681,"both parents w cancer, school, help","Hi. I am pretty new to Reddit, but I just have been feeling overwhelmed. I am 20 years old, and both of my parents have cancer. My dad was diagnosed with colon cancer when I was a senior in high school and my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer three months ago. I only have one sibling, but she is special needs. None of my friends have ever had to deal with this, and they don't understand. I know they try, but it is hard to explain to someone who cannot comprehend the entirety of the situation. I feel as if I have sacrificed so much. I wanted to go to UT Austin for my undergrad, but I never even applied because of my dad's situation. So I go to the local university, and now that it is my last semester here. I was preparing to go to law school or grad school, but then my mom was diagnosed. And I feel like I need to stay, and I am just so trapped. I can't talk about it with anyone close to me, my sister doesn't even know my parents have cancer. And it's so hard, I feel like my entire life I have worked so hard for my education and I keep doing things I don't want so I can be close to my parents and I am so mad at myself for feeling angry about that, but I can't help it.

690,In search of some kind thoughts after my dad passed away.,"3 months ago, my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer and everything since then my life has taken a big turn. He've been in incredible pain because he was already in the terminal stage of the disease and his body was invaded with it. One night he couldn't breathe and we called to the hospital. In the ambulance, on our way to the hospital, they told us that one lung was completely sick and the other one had only 5% left to breathe. Just before they arrived to the hospital, he passed away. (2 weeks ago) 
It is so hard for us now.. I see him everywhere and I miss him, I cry every night because he was so young..

Now it is just me mom and my little brother, my mom is devastated and my brother is just too little, I still believe that he doesn't truly understand what just happened. I kinda feel like I must be the person to cheer them up and bring things together but I just can't find the strength to do it.

I was always ""daddy's girl"" and now I just don't know what to do or what to say.. I dream at night that this is just a nightmare and I find myself looking for him after waking up.

697,Losing my brother,"My brother was diagnosed with anaplastic astrocytoma 6 years ago when he was 24, and over the last 6 years he’s had 2 surgeries, but the cancer never seemed too aggressive and we thought his medical team had it under control.

After his last surgery in October, he started to have no short term memory and constantly throwing up. He had to take time off his job as a wills and trust lawyer, which he hated. Right before Christmas, after his local doctors dropped the ball over and over again, seeming like they were just waiting for him whither away, his wife and our family had him moved to Mayo in Phoenix, where they discover his cancer had turned to glioblastoma and had taken over most of his brain. They told us we would have 2-5 weeks with him.

I switch between so many emotions daily. This ducking disease is stealing my brother, who can no longer walk and can hardly speak. I hate seeing him in pain, but I’m not ready to lose him. I know no one is ever ready to lose the people they love, but he’s 31 with 4 young children. It’s not fair. 

I’m heartbroken for any family that will have to go through this. I’m angry that our local hospital stole weeks from us when they weren’t treating him because they had no idea how to deal with his rare cancer.

700,Granddaughter with grandfather with returning cancer.,"Hey all!
First time posting here.
I'm 24 years old, and I discovered 3 years ago my grandfather had cancer. He went through the chemo treatments and for a while he was cancer free. The cancer in particular is Folliculer Lymphoma. He's quiet about it, but what I do know is that it's in his hair follicles on his head. 
Just this year it came back. So tomorrow he is being admitted to the hospital for 2 months to go  through stem cell removal, then strong chemo. And then those stem cells put back and more strong chemo. It's a 99.5% success rate. But I have anxiety, and all I think about is that .5% and it's tough. I know I have so many positives placed before me but all I see are the negatives.
I'm honestly not sure if I'm looking for advice or just need to get this off my chest. But this really is a breath of fresh air. The months to come will be difficult but I can only hope they are successful.

It doesn't feel right because I still feel like she is a part of my life, the best part really.  She didn't ask me to do this, but I am sure that she would have wanted you all to know what happened because this community meant a lot to her.  

She always said it hurt when voices here went silent with no explanation.  She decided in October to stop pursuing treatment.  The immunotherapy drugs were only slowing down the growth of her cancer so Hospice was brought it.  They met with her at our home and decided that they wanted to bring her to their center to manage her pain.  I didn't know that would be the last rational conversation I would have with her... I would have thought of something better to say.  The level of morphine needed to manage her pain made it very difficult to communicate.  She became confused, unable to speak, and slept a lot.  She wanted to come home... she said as much by getting up and packing her bags.  She died here, in our old bedroom. It was November 4th. She was surrounded by family and friends.  Her last words were, 'I love you Andy'.  That's me, by the way.  I am sorry that I didn't  do this sooner.  This group helped her a lot.

703,I am officially Radioactive,"So today was my first radiation treatment for Squamous Cell Carcinoma. All I have to say is that I am glad the other 32 treatments will be shorter. Before the treatment actually started they had to put me in my mask and run a test run through the treatment and get final clearance from the doctor. This made my time twice as long. One of the problems I have is that with my tonsils being swelled up I have a hard time breathing through my nose. When I am lying on my back I find that I can breath In through my nose but not out. This made my mouth dry and uncomfortable. Other than that it pretty much sucked. I will take the suckiness over cancer any day though. Here is to one treatment closer to cancer free!

705,Leukemia,"A little over a week ago, when my dad went in for a check up because his strep wasn’t getting better, he was diagnosed with leukemia, CLL to be exact. A few days later we found out he was misdiagnosed and has a pretty devastating subtype of AML. It has absolutely crushed me. I have just recently repaired my relationship with my dad and knowing that he is so sick is extremely difficult for me to process. I live 11 hours away at college and cannot get time off to go home, even though there is a high possibility they will need me for stem cell transplants. I’m scared to death of the financial crisis we are in and the fact that my father, who would do anything in this world for me, may not be around for a whole lot longer. I am taking out more loans for school to help my family and have picked up a second job. 
What else can I do to help them? What should I send my dad to brighten his day and his stay in the hospital?

708,My dads cancer came back,"This will be a long story, so I am sorry I'm advance. 

I am 18, and when I was 16 my dad fell ill. He went on a golfing trip with his buddies. Just a fun little getaway. When he got back, he felt a bit sick, just nauseous. So for a few days, we just thought it was the beer and wings he ate with his friends. Lol. 

But then those days turned to weeks, and we were getting concerned. He wasn't eating much. And he was starting to turn yellow, like his eyes and his skin had a tinge. I was worried, but thought it was nothing bad.
My mom took him into emergency, just to make sure everything was ok (we live in a small town). His blood work was all out of wack, and he has lost quite a bit of weight from not eating. 

Because of his blood work results, they did more tests (CT scan). Of course, since we live in a small town, our hospital does not have the materials for more complex testing to be done. So they referred him to the hospital in the largest city close to us, and he had more appointments.

They found a small lump completely blocking his gall bladder duct into the duodenum. There was no bile being secreted, so no oils could be broken down. That is why he was nauseous. They took a biopsy of it.

Of course, me being fairly innocent, thought it was an easy fix of just going down through his mouth to remove the lump (kind of like a gastroscopy, I guess). I was wrong. The doctors were unsure of whether or not it was cancer, so they scheduled him in for the Whipple surgery. They put a stint in his gall bladder so he was comfortable until they could do the surgery. 

My parents left me and my brother and travelled to the bigger city (about 3ish hours away) for the surgery. I was so scared. I guess that is normal, but I felt terrified and scared. I felt like my mind was like a skipping cd, if that makes sense. I was filled with worry for my dad. This was during exams, so I found it difficult to study. Of course, I felt so sad that my dad had to go through this. The whipple is not a small surgery. 

They removed 40% of his pancreas, his gall bladder, and a section of his duodenum. But, when I saw him, he was very much himself. He seemed ok, but thin. 

 he was doing very well. At home, running around, driving. The doctors said his recovery time was remarkably fast. We got the biospy results back, and the lump turned out to be cancerous. I felt so scared, but I remembered ""hey, they got it all out with the surgery. We're good."" They did put him on chemotherapy once a week for three weeks, then off for a week, for 6 months. 

Unfortunately, this made his kidneys sort of crap out, and he needed a urine bag that went directly into his right kidney. I was sad and scared, but they stopped doing the chemotherapy, so I guess that made me feel better. To anyone who has gone through chemo or has had a loved one go through it, I am very sorry. It's a really sad thing using poison to fight cancer.

But, after a while, his kidney function improved, and despite needing a stint in his urethra, the bag and tube were removed.  We were all so happy. He was finally back to normal. He started work, I started graduated and started university, everything was great.

My dad went to get a stint change, which usually caused a UTI. So no surprise when he felt a bit shitty after his latest stint change. But then he got worse. He was taken to the big city hospital, and his liver was not draining properly. They put a bag and tube there to drain it. Then we found out his cancer came back . He stayed in the hospital for a week, then he went home.

He was taken back because the tube got kinked. They fixed it, but he's still in there.

That's what's happening. I am really scared. Uni students know it's finals time but I can't get my mind off my dad. I am worried and I don't know what to do. I live 3 hours away from home, but I just want to see him. He is meeting with the oncologist tomorrow to make a plan of action. I don't want to just skip my finals but I can't seem to do any effective studying. I don't know what to do, and I just want my dad to be ok?  

I'm very hopeful that he will be

711,Best Easter news of all... STILL CANCER FREE AFTER STAGE IV DIAGNOSIS!!!,"Hi everyone!

I've posted on here quite a few times about my dad. You can look through my posts if you want more background. But king story short, my 50 year old dad was diagnosed stage IV colorectal cancer in May 2019. He had extensive chemo, then liver surgery in November, then more chemo (last one on christmas eve!)

Now, we are 5 months COMPLETELY cancer free and we are hoping for him to be cured forever. Stage IV is unbelievably heartbreaking. But we are some of the lucky few that have gotten through this. I hope this can be encouraging for others on this same journey.

Is this a common feeling? 

Edit: thank you all for the support. I feel a bit better sleeping on it. I'm still sad I wasn't there but I have to realize she wasn't alone.

My partner has been so good but I can tell he is at the end of his tether. He said I need to accept it and I'm not helping myself and he's finding it hard to deal with the constant sadness.

I don't know what to do, I'm grieving a life I thought we were going to have, I'm exhausted from chemo, about to lose my hair. I feel the most unattractive I've ever felt in my life and I don't want him seeing me that way. Reading all your stories is heartbreaking I don't want him to go through any of that, I love him so much. I'm constantly consumed by guilt about what he's going to have to go through and wonder if it's best just to let him go.

718,"Struggling, don't know if I should avoid my dad? Anyone deal with angry loved ones with cancer?","I believe I've posted here about my dad already once a few weeks ago.

Things have gotten worse and I don't know if the cancer he has is actually beatable like my family originally thought. So far, all we have is speculation courtesy of the doctors keeping their lips tightly shut. All they managed to say was that yes, he has cancer. They haven't said what kind yet (with the exception of one \[not the normal GP my dad sees\] guessing it could be something like bone cancer; some other kind of cancer, etc). They also haven't been helpful when it comes to kicking the oncologist in the ass; since they should've called us already some time ago. We're stuck with a shitty governmental one. We don't really know how to 100% contact this said oncologist (since the GP doc keep the info on the computer). Nobody's offering any help when it comes to treatment, since he hasn't seen an oncologist yet. I feel like by the time the oncologist thinks of us, he'll be fucking dead.

He possibly has more issues than any of us thought. An example of this is the fact his gut actually hasn't disappeared. He's lost 20 pounds (due to not eating) and is actually close to where he should be (ideal weight/height ratio wise). His gut should actually be gone; but his gut is still the same (think beer gut style; without the beer). So he might already have a tumor in his stomach. They're also worried about lung involvement, since he's been having trouble breathing particularly as of late. While his breathing already wasn't good (courtesy of COPD), it's gotten worse. 

I'm admittedly stressed out due to this and a little more sensitive. Everything hurts a little extra. I was already a super sensitive person before this whole thing; now I'm even more super sensitive (which I didn't even know was possible since I thought I was already at max sensitive mode). 

This is a problem, since my dad's in pain. His lower back is essentially obliterated for all intents and purposes (since they saw one vertebrae literally gone; one fractured and a few others that were equally fucked up). So naturally, he's a grouchy, super depressed and angrier since he's been in agony like this for nearly a year. I imagine his anger's originating from the depression (especially since my dad's had shit luck for these past few year and he thinks he's pretty much a dead man walking \[and he may be right or wrong \[it'd help if the oncologist fucking CALLED to confirm or deny that he's a dead man walking\]).

This doesn't help, since I'm already a crybaby by nature. I know he's literally not in his right state of mind (since I imagine he's stressed to the most possible max any human can be \[courtesy of not even knowing if he'll survive or not\] + in agony, since the pain meds seem to only help about 50% of the time). So I try not to take things too personally, but it's nearly impossible for me.   


I still take every little edgy and mean comment he says to heart. I can't help it, as much as I wish I could. It's making me wonder if I should avoid him possibly or not. I don't really want to bring up the fact he hurt my feelings yet again (since it's over something I consider super stupid). But I want to spend as much time with him as possible like I always have. I already know my parents aren't going to be around forever (due to cancer or some other unforeseeable event \[at this rate I'm just waiting for a meteor to hit us all since our luck's been just that shitty for the past few years\]). I want to make as many happy memories with them while I can. But it's hard if I'm constantly feeling hurt by every little mean comment he says.",3.0,"['struggling', 'do not', 'know', 'should', 'avoid', 'famrel', 'anynumber', 'deal', 'angry', 'loved', 'numbers',

722,The day I shaved my wife's head,"I stood behind my sobbing wife, who was seating in a chair in front of me in our bathroom with a towel around her neck. Next to me was the stool with a razor and a can of shaving cream and a towel. I was holding the buzzing clippers in my hand and it finally hit me, how real this was. I mean of course knew it was real but I finally excepted how sick she really was.

I shaved right down the middle per her request to just get it over with. It felt like a blur as I shaved the rest of her long hair off. I finished her off with a smooth razor shave. 

She turned around and I saw in front of me a bald woman who had shown so much courage the past few weeks. Bald but beautiful. I couldn't help but plant a kiss her newly bald head after kissing her soft, tender lips.

When she saw her new bald look in the mirror for the first time, she laughed hysterically. It was the first time I had heard my wife be genuinely happy in the past few weeks.

724,A son coming to grips with the loss of his mom,"Mom died. 

Actually, more than a year ago. May 4, 2017. 

In September 2015, she was diagnosed with Stage IV adenocarcinoma, a 7-centimeter tumor in her left lung and small specks of cancer in her right. She was only given eight months to live. 

By God’s grace, genetically she was a candidate for a clinical trial drug called Tarceva that stabilized the cancer for many months. We had all hoped the drug would shrink the tumor, but it only stopped it for a while. “Stable is a positive in our world,” the oncologist had said. 

In summer 2016, Tarceva stopped working and she began traditional chemotherapy. We were back on our eight-month timeline. I was at many of her infusions.

But there is no cure for Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Treatments only give you more time.

Mom had time to go on one last trip with each of her kids. My two sisters went to Mexico with her. My brother to Colorado. And I, at the final hour, in February 2017, went with her to San Francisco and Yosemite.

I was there with mom at the hospital for many of the downturns. When she had her needle biopsy and they staged the cancer and mom found out it was going to kill her. When Tarceva didn’t shrink but only stabilized the tumor. When the oncologist said all the treatment options had failed and the best chance for quality of life in the time she had left was to go home into hospice care and let cancer go.

I asked him how much time she had. He said, “Weeks to months.” If you’re counting, that’s two to eight weeks.

Mom lasted six.

I remember the first day she was home in hospice. One of her girl friends come over to visit. Mom talked with her for an hour, going on about this and that. I sat in a room off to the side listening to her talk, not the words, just the sound of her talking, and it was so pleasant remembering all the times as a kid growing up and listening to her talk on the phone with her friends.

She lost a lot of weight. She made it to her sixtieth birthday. In the end, she was a breathing skeleton. She started hallucinating. And in the last two weeks, she became less and less responsive. She spent her last three days sitting in a padded recliner with her arms folded on a desk in front of her and her head down. I think it was the only position that opened up her chest cavity to allow her to get enough Oxygen. 

An hour before her death, her breathing changed to a series of brief sniffs.

A minute before she died, I heard the sniffs catching in the back of her throat, and I knew the air wasn’t getting to her lungs. I told the rest of the family, “This is it.”

The five of us were there. I held her two hands in front. My brother was on her right. My sister was on her left. My dad and my other sister huddled over her further to the left. It was hard to tell when she took her last breath, but at some point, one of my sisters said, “I think she’s gone.”

When she died, everyone cried out loud; I remember specifically my dad and my brother, though.

But I didn’t. I went for a walk around the lake and my legs buckled beneath me every few steps.

I loved my mom.

All the people who knew and loved my family, some knew better than others, that there’s a sadness among our family that’s deeper than death and cancer. And the hurt is this: Decades of not-talked-about hurt and coldness and distance and missed conversations and lost time between my dad and mom. Loss of husband-wife warmth and relationship, all lived out under one roof but never reconciled. It was the bigger tragedy.

I was sitting beside my mom, just us two, when the oncologist told her it was time to go home into hospice. Dad came in and mom told him. I remember he audibly choked back a sob, then he kissed her on the forehead, choked back another sob, and kissed her on the forehead again.

After all the years of him keeping his emotions inside a fortress, I was shocked, *shocked* to see him cry.

I wish none of this had ever happened. I wish mom and dad had loved each other and been truly happy. I wish mom had never gotten cancer. I wish she hadn’t died. It never had to end this way.",8.0,"['famrel', 'coming', 'grips', 'loss', 'mom', 'mom', 'died', 'actually', 'more', 'than', 'year', 'ago', 'month', 'digit', 'digit', 'month', 'digit', 'diagnosed',

They have been a great support to each other these past 6 months, understanding what each other is going through compared to other friends. His mom and I have also been supporting each other. We both have great family and friends but having someone get it is amazing. Then 10 days ago he got a fever turned out to be pneumonia and he passed away yesterday. With the Chemo and radiation he was getting his body couldn’t fight it. My heart is breaking for his family and my daughter is taking it really hard.

727,Struggling with letting my boyfriend in more about my moms terminal cancer,"I am struggling with how to let my (23f) boyfriend (25m) in more regarding my moms (57f) terminal illness. I am sorry if this is long, but i feel like I have so much I need to air out and I don’t know where to turn.

 A little under a year ago my mom was diagnosed with late stage breast cancer. My mom has had cancer twice before in the past decade, but had 4 good and healthy years before this terminal diagnosis. 

Up until early September, my mom had very few symptoms. She maintained a rich social life, walked the dog every day and was mostly feeling herself. It was easy for me to remain positive when my mom was seemingly doing great. But in the last few months her condition has worsened. In the past few weeks especially, she has had severe pain, major loss in appetite and has been basically bedridden. We are awaiting further diagnostics and answers but this a very bad sign that the end may be closer than we anticipated. Her visible symptoms make the nature of her life ending feel way more real which is forcing me to come to terms with things in a bigger way. 

I think I have somewhat accepted the nature of the situation, and I remain somewhat positive. I am super grateful for the 23 years I have had with her, I feel like we had a bond that many people can’t cultivate in a lifetime. My mom has the best attitude. She lives in the moment, she has an unmatched love for life and appreciation for the little things. It’s tough to see this side of her fading away in recent weeks. She’s my biggest fan, and I admire her so much. She and I are best friends. My mom and I have discussed that when she passes we truly will not have anything left unsaid because we understand each other and are bonded on such a deep level.  But that still doesn’t make what’s happening any less sad, and I still am experiencing anticipatory grief, helplessness, anxiety and uncertainty. 

For more context on my relationship- my boyfriend and I have been officially dating for 4 months but have a closeness that makes it feel like I’ve known him for a lifetime. We are more in love with each other than either of us has ever been with previous partners. We have spent lots of time with each others friends and families, we talk about everything, and have so much fun in each other’s company. He makes me feel so loved, we are so comfortable with each other, and I have so much faith in who he is as a person. I trust him immensely. He is genuine, easy to communicate with, humble and emotionally mature. But this doesn’t change the fact that the relationship is relativity new, even though I truly believe that he is going to be in my life for a long long time. 

My boyfriend is well aware of the situation with my mom. I have explained things in an in-depth way initially, and expressed some of my grievances along the way. But recently as my moms condition has worsened I’ve noticed I’ve pushed some of the emotions to the side and tried to throw myself into my social life, my job and my classes. The positivity of falling in love has made it somewhat easy to do so. But this past weekend while with my boyfriend something triggered feelings about my mom in the most unexpected way. I am usually very together with my emotions so it was tough to accept how out of control I felt. I cried in his arms on and off for a few hours while barely being able to say more than a few sentences. I usually do not feel comfortable enough to allow myself to do that with anyone but he gave me a very safe space to feel things out. I still went right to explaining away my emotions, things like “I am sorry I don’t know why I’m like this.” Or things like, “I think there is so much certainty and that’s scary”. But really didn’t give him much to go off of. I never really fully recovered for the rest of that day. He was immensely supportive. He asked a few questions, comforted me, listened to what I needed, and expressed empathy in such a huge way to the point that he was pretty much tearing up. He held me, gently asked if I wanted to go for a walk or go for ice cream, and showed me some of his favourite songs he listens to when he is sad. When we parted ways the next day I held him close and told him how much I appreciated him, and how I want to talk to him but sometimes it’s hard. 

He has told me many times if I need someone to talk to that he will be there. I can tell that he wants me to let him in more, and keep him updated on things too. I really want to be able to get into depth with all of the little things I am feeling about this and open up about the messy, intricate details about what my family is going through. But it’s tough because I feel like that’s a huge burden to put on someone. I don’t want him to feel badly because he doesn’t know the right thing to say. I also have my own baggage that if I let all of this messy stuff out too heavily that it can take away from all of the positive, fun and funny things I like about my personality and make me into someone who is “too much”. I know this is all in my head but it’s scary.  I don’t know if it’s inappropriate for me to put all of that on him, or if this is better suited for a psychologist. I feel like I really need someone to talk to who isn’t one of my immediate family members. Being completely vulnerable isn’t easy. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to or when to approach this with him or handle what I’m going through? I really want to be able to let him in more but I don’t know what the healthiest or best thing is for the both of us. I’ve never been this close to anyone I’ve dated so I am not used to this territory.

728,Yesterday’s scan results,"My cancer is stage 4 melanoma. 

Last year I had a tumour in my groin and it spread to my lungs liver and brain. I was told if I didn’t respond well to treatment I could have only months left to live.


Yesterday my brain scan came back all clear, liver clear, just very tiny mets left in the lungs which have shrank since my last scan. Biggest lesion just less than 2mm

I work full time go to the gym and have started dating a really nice woman after I had a fling with a work colleague that didn’t go well

So I’m just living a normal life.

To those of you that are very ill and treatment ain’t going well, or those that have loved ones I’m sorry.

732,"I feel like a total b*tch, mad at cancer","My 14 year old daughter was recently diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma and is going through chemotherapy treatment. We have received zero support from her school, not even an email/card wishing her the best.  They even dragged their feet getting her work so she could begin home hospital school, I had to send repeated emails for them to give us the work.  The school has not been helpful or supportive at all.  But I feel like a bitch because I got a late notice on a library book today, so I went to return it.  The librarian said we owe $10.  I said “I don’t understand, if she’s been on home hospital and is unable to come to school why we would receive a late fee?” The librarian said “It’s your child’s responsibility to turn things in on time”. I then said “Well she can’t because she is being treated for cancer!”  I could tell the librarian was taken aback and then I felt horrible for blurting that out.  I’m just so frustrated and sad at the lack of support from the school.  But maybe I’m really just pissed and mad that my daughter has cancer.  Thanks for listening

734,Looking for hope,"Hi all, 

I’m 15 years old, and i was diagnosed with osteosarcoma in May of 2019. I did 18 rounds of chemo, a limb salvage surgery on my right leg and was given the all clear in February. I recently found out I have relapsed after only three months in remission. 

My oncologist gave us another treatment plan which will involve 6 cycles of a different kind of chemotherapy and surgery to remove the nodules in my lungs.

This time around I feel really scared and discouraged. I can do treatment again, i’ve done it before but I understand this time that the prognosis is much poorer especially with how fast i relapsed. I had so many things planned for my life after treatment, i’ve been getting stronger in physical therapy and this just feels so unfair, i’m scared for what my future holds and i want to be a long term survivor so badly but I honestly feel cautious to be optimistic with the numbers my oncologist gave me. 

I’m not really sure why i’m posting this, i’ve never posted before but i think i’m just looking for reasons to keep going and stay positive from others in this community even when the odds are against me

I was ready to move. I was saving money. I am working nearly every day and than.. it happened. My father had an accident at work and can barely walk. His legs are completely swollen and he can't breathe through the pain. He just takes painkillers and tries to sleep. My mother can't breathe, her lungs are filled witg fluid once again, and she has to go to the hospital. 

I now have to take care of my household once again. He can't go to work and he doesn't want to go to the hospital right now. I can't move out, I have to stay arround and help. Idk anymore. Every time I take a step forward life knocks me down. I don't know anymore. I have to with my mother back to the hospital were we'll probably have to stay for a couple of days. I always go with her and stay with her to make her feel safe and because I help the nurses and her (with things like showering). But now my dad is telling me that he can't move and that he is going to need my help aswell. And I also have to work everyday to try to take care of everything. I feel like I can't breathe. 

My mother had some trouble sleeping these couple of days and I stayed up with her, and I'm just exhausted if life. I don't like this life. My whole body hurts. My way out, break of life, has been working out and last time I did that I fainted. I can't keep up with every thing. I even forget to eat, unless I'm working (cause than I atleast get a 30 minute break). 

I can't do this. I can't keep doing this. I've been slacking at home and I've been slacking at work and at everything in my life. I feel like I'm going crazy. All day I'm smiling at customers, while inside I'm breaking down. I can't do this. I've had a conversation with my therapist about it and he said that I had to talk to my mother about it all to see if she really did expect me to work, go to school, go to my internship, go to appointments at the hospitals, financially take care of the house, clean and cook and all of that. And I did. She does expect me to do most of it. She tells me that I don't have to go to the hospital if it's to much, but how can I not go to the hospital?

She's fucking dying, this is her last possible treatment. She's dying. The doctor said that I'd be lucky if had her for one or two more years. How can I just not go to the hospital when every day could be her last? How can I focus on class when she's dying at the hospital? It's not realistic. And that's the only thing that she doesn't expect from me. The rest I should do. Idk. She's also reached a point were she tells me how badly she wants to go. To just end it all. Wtf am I supposed to do? I can't breathe.

Ofcourse she's depressed the only time she leaves the house is to go to the hospital. What kind of life is that? She also doesn't want/isn't able to leave the hospital if she's not in a wheelchair, because she reached the point that she can't walk more than a couple of steps before not being able to breathe. She doesn't want a wheelchair though. And my dad doesn't want to go to the hospital. And both need to be cared for. I'm trying to not care for my piece of shit brothers (23 and 20) who refuse to help out in the house, financially or my parents. My brother doesn't want to bring my dad to the hospital. I have to. After I make breakfast, clean the house, and work an 8 hour shift, I'll have to bring him to the hospital. Than go back home to get my mother and bring her to her hospital, I'll have to somehow travel 45 minutes back to his hospital (idk why they don't go to the same one), bring him home, make dinner, go to her, sleep there (?) And get ready to go to work again. 

I don't know anymore. My mental health is already a fucking mess, but I guess that it's just all dumb. Life is stupid. It gives you people to love and than threatens to take them from you, not offering you a cure. and as the person you love more than life is fading away right infornt of you, you see the people who they loved become self involved monsters who only care for themselves. There aren't many good people, and all their friends get sick and tirwd of seeing your loved one being sick and tired. It happens to often so they call less and less, barely visir, apologize and say that life took over. And it did. Because they still have their life. But the truth is that the people who see their loved one die and care for that person are dying to. Every second they see them in pain, they're hurting. Every  sedond the person dies more inside, it feels like they're dying. But they're not. They're life goes on. They still have work and school and bills and people they know and will get to know. As THEY are dying, they also have to live. Life goes on, and you're expected to go on, strong. You've been strong for so long, when will you drop all the weight? 

When will you stop dying along their side and live your life? Will you ever stop dying along their side and just live your life? She's my meaning. My reason to keep going. My reason to breathe. Don't make others your reason. I made her mine, but now she's running out of time and I need another reason. She has other reasons. Why couldn't her cancer be mine. That makes me selfish. I want to take her cancer pain, but it will replace her pain with the pain of losing a daughter. I'm selfish, I'm still young I could fight her cancer better. I am physically strongee than her. I wouldn't mind being there instead of her. Because life would stop. I don't mind if life just stopped. 

I'm selfish and I know that it would hurt a lot less for me to lose myself than to lose my mother. I know my mother, I don't know myself. I love my mother more than I could ever love myself. I would just fight for her. And she'd be by my side and I'd be alright because she'd be by my side.

This is killing me and I selfishly want to die before she does cause I'm so tired. 
I'm tired of life everyone in my life. I'm tired of fake smiling and taking carw of everything and everyone. I'm tired of working everyday and barely sleeping and feeling sick and hospitals. I'm tired of the sound oh her coughing desperately trying to breathe. I'm  tired of hearing and seeing the changes in her as her lungs fill up. I'm just tired of fighting and trying to be strong. I'm tired of crying and trying not to cry. I'm tired if everyone at work finding out that she's sick and them looking at me with pity. I'm tired of not recognizing the woman who have birth to me. She may still be alive, but the cancer killed her. It killed her smile, her joy, her innocence in the way she looked at the people she cared about, it killed her love for life. And she told me she doesn't want to fight death when it comes for her. 

I can't talk to my immediate family cause no one is there for her, no one seems to care or accept her reality. I can't talk to my extended family, because part of them just shout at me that I should get married, because than she can see me get married before she dies. The other part cares about her so much, that she told me to lie to them about how she's doing. So I'm alone. She's not with me anymore. Her cancer is all she can think about, it has consumed her. How could it not when it took her hair, than her energy, her ability to breathe normally and her ability to walk more than a few steps.
Every thing about her screems cancer. 

So I just go to work and take care if every thing and every one. 

You know what I'll say it. I'm mad at the world right now. I never thought the world owed me anything but fuck it. I'm mad at the world. I'm mad at by brother's for being bad people and hurting my mother and not helping and being selfish! I'm mad at my dad for acting like everything's fine and ignoring the fact that my mother has cancer and ia dying! I'm mad at my father because he'll never choose my side and if he had raised men instead of little boys thinga would've been different. I'm mad at my father because I warned him about my little brother and told him many times that he is never going to get an education and he's going to.hang out with the wrong people and get himself in some trouble with the law, and he didn't believe me. And now my little brother has been dropping out of schools like it's his job, when he doesn't have a job he steals money from us or sells out stuff. He owes the government and his ex schools a lot of money and he's getting worse. I'm mad at the doctors for telling us her cancer was gone and than later telling us that it wasn't gone and that it has spread and became worse. I'm mad at the doctors of ignoring her pain and claiming that it was a side effect. I'm mad at myself for believing and trusting in them because they're doctors. I'm mad at my personal trainer who told me that I was just trying to make my mother's illness about myself. I'm mad at the people who come visit my mother without telling us first and than expecting me to serve them drinks and foods the whole time that they're here. I'm mad at cancer for being cancer. I'm mad at life for sucking. I'm just mad. I'm also just mad cause I'm sad. I'm also mad because every time I cry I get a migraine, which is like life telling me ""oh you're sad, here bow now you're also in more pain! You're welcome!""

I'm mad at myself for complaining, cause there are people out there dying. But than I also remember that so is my mother so that makes a little sense. I just wanted to get that off my chest and be a little bi*ch just being mad and sad and upset.

739,How to Ask For Help...,"Caregivers who have been successful in delegating tasks and asking for help - how? My husband was diagnosed over 7 years ago (although technically his first tumor was 10 years ago). People aren't actively offering to help anymore because things have been stable for a while now. 

Things have gotten a lot worse the last couple of weeks. He's going through radiation and all of his symptoms have gotten worse. He is currently running a fever and we're back and forth with the hospital to see if we need to drive down to the ER. He is more exhausted and having to take pain meds occasionally that knock him out. This means a lot of the housework stuff that he was doing is falling to me.

We're blessed that his dad is retired and is able to drive him to things and my parents offer to drive as well. I could use some help. though. I'm working full time and in grad school full time.

740,My drs have never given me a time left to live. Never once. Today I found I have “12 month left” in my MYChart online and feel sick.,"UPDATE 2: talked to the dr. He said it was only in my chart so that I could get into the pain management dr. He did say I may not make it to 40 but bet me. I’m 31. I got time to prove him wrong. That’s way too long of a time to be guessing. So I’m not gonna worry about it. My husband and I have reservations next week for a fancy dinner with my best fiend and I am just looking forward to that far out. Thank you everyone who has commented and been so supportive 


UPDATE 1: I called the office the morning and told the nurse what happened and she look at the chart at the office and says there’s nothing in there that reflects what the online chart says. Says it may be some algorithm crap he had to write in there for my referral. Doctor will be calling in about an hour or so so talk to me. I will update again then

My mom is currently dealing with breast cancer. She's doing radiation now. The problem is she has no appetite except for unhealthy foods. She barely consumes anything and when she does she asks for milkshakes and sodas or something else that's sugary.

750,New Cancer Rules?,"I have been coming to this sub for a while now & use it primarily for my own support dealing with my recovery, & supporting others who have to deal with loss of a loved one or a new diagnosis, or their ongoing issues with their own illness. 
I am not an angry person, but find myself becoming enraged lately at two different types of posts.  The first, is the ""Is This Cancer?"" post by paranoid hypochondriacts or people who have not been to a doctor for even a preliminary finding.  How many times must we tell people we don't diagnose, to see a doctor if they're suspicious, & to obtain health insurance if possible, especially if they are worried about cancer?  Can we take a vote to ban these posts?  I want our sub to be inclusive, but seriously, this is getting old.  The second type of post is the ""Obvious Hoax Cures All Cancers"" post.  If lemons & baking soda cured cancer, do we really believe those of us who suffered through chemo, radiation, surgeries, transplants, etc... would have done so?  
I know we can somewhat control content with our upvotes & downvotes, but this is a small sub so even the zeroes show up.  Even seeing these posts are like a slap in the face to those of us suffering through REAL cancer & REAL treatment, be it us or a loved one.  This sub shouldn't be a home for science deniers or conspiracy theorists, we have r/conspiracy if you want to believe that big parma is interfering with cancer cures.  
So, I propose a vote to ban these posts.

751,Any who has experience with this type of cancer?,"Hello, I've been recently hit with the news my dad actually has cancer. In particular his type seems to be metastatic disease (or multiple myeloma? \[not entirely sure, since my brain 100%  legitimately shut down after getting slapped with the word ""cancer""\]). We don't know how far it's spread or anything, since we were only talking to a chiropractor that has access to my dad's MRI scans (and the scans were strictly only focused on his spine, nothing else).

I'm just wondering if anyone else on here has experience with this type of cancer; so I can figure out what to expect survival wise. I'd especially like to at least get a semi-realistic guess on his chances of surviving this thing. It feels like the chiropractor friend who gave us this heads up may be blowing smoke up our asses a little bit to make us feel better; and I feel like the doctors are going to give us the dark, ""you're going to die from this 100% guaranteed"" version.

752,It's over.,"My dad passed this morning peacefully at age 55.  I'm 20 and now own a cat, an apartment full of stuff, and a business - which thankfully my mom is running for me. I go away to the school of my dreams in September. I've been very calm, and am relieved his suffering is over, the only thing to spike my emotions was the awful breathing in the last days even though I knew he wasnt in pain. His cat is also unusually affectionate to me, (shes always play fought with me as affection) and she keeps turning the corner looking for him in his room, which got me pretty bad. Last night he went non-reponsive and I had a conversation with him. I told him I know he loves me and everyone, and that we all love him so much that we want him to be comfortable, and that it is his choice if he wants to go. That he raised me to be a fighter and although I'll miss him, I'll be okay and I'll make sure his cat and his mentally disabled brother are okay. This morning I was woken up by the call, so I hope he heard me. I'm spreading his ashes in a cemetary/nature reserve in an area he loved in the morning before the funeral, which will be held on April Fools Day. I know he would find that hilarious. I have no doubt that there will be hundreds in attendance from AA and other communities he touched with his humor and divine kindness. I don't know if this was the right place to post this, but thanks for reading anyways. Fuck cancer.

777,Coping mechanisms and media,"Hello everyone

I just wanted to share a wonderful experience I had while watching a TV show.

To preface. My mother was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer exactly a year ago.  We have for the most part been well and adapting to this new life.  But we have struggled with communicating with each other our deep feelings about the situation and what will come.  Mainly facing what life means without each other.  
I was watching a show on Netflix titled ""The Midnight Gospel."" and found an episode that I think really helped myself, my mother and anyone else currently struggling with this. For those who are unaware it is an adult animated series adapting real interviews from a podcast hosted by Duncan Trussell. 
Duncans mother passed away from cancer and before she passed he had a long in depth interview with her. And his interview with her was adapted into Episode 8 ""Mouse of Silver.""
It was really beautiful.  So I shared it with my mother.  And while it is not something my mother would normally watch, she did and since then we have had better communication and it has put in her a place of ease. 
I want to encourage others to watch this episode (or all the episodes!) and maybe share it with loved ones.  If the animated effects are too much, then just listening is enough. 

I'd also like to ask if there are any other forms of media people have found that have touched them and helped them through all this.  Books, movies, shows, articles.

778,Life after caregiving / what to expect,"Hello everybody (I’m new to this). 

I’m Brandon, a 17 year old lad, in late September, my grandad got diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and given only around 6 months to live. He lives on his own so I visit him everyday to help do daily tasks, shopping, clean, help with medication etc, and others visit maybe once a week or at a weekend to help sort paperwork and appointments out. 

I am writing this on here because he has gone downhill in the last few weeks , meaning the final stages are approaching faster than expected.

This may sound strange but I haven’t showed much emotion, I feel like this is because I am constantly thinking of things I could help him with next. The way I have not showed emotions have really concerned me and I feel once he does pass, I will go off the rails. 

What I am trying to ask, is what happens after? 

I only see my friends once a month, if that and I am really scared that I won’t feel a connection with them.

779,This is my story I am now cancer free!!,This is a really good time to tell everyone the news that I have to tell. So not everyone knows about this but the summer of 2018 I was diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma and this was the worst thing that truly has ever happened to me and I was honestly so devastated. So that summer I was in the process of moving already and this just made everything so June 12 I went on a plane to Boston and no joke that day we met with the doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital and they confirmed what I had. So that entire summer I was busy kicking cancers ass which I took like an absolute champ and then I moved to Northfield Vermont and started school at Montpelier High School those who know military kids know that making friends is not the easiest thing to do but there are a few kids that welcomed me and to them I say thank you so much it actually means so much to me. So throughout the school year it was quite hard to not only keep up with all my classes junior year but also trying to get into school as often as possible was quite difficult as well. I also met probably one of the best person ever and that is my Girlfriend Savannah Tedder I have kept out relationship pretty private but I just want to say that she has helped me out this last 7 months so much and she means so much to me. I have also had many many awesome opportunities this year including meeting David Ortiz and some world champion Red Sox players as shitty this year has been I’m glad I have had some once in a lifetime experiences. On May 10ish I finished the final stretch of treatment and up until that point I had finished both chemo therapy and radiation treatment. Finally on June 21 I had the final full body scans and everything had come back positive with absolutely no signs what so ever of any evidence of and indication of cancer cells so it’s official I am now cancer free!,9.0,"['story', 'now', 'cancer', 'free', 'good', 'time', 'tell', 'everynumber', 'news', 'tell', 'so', 'not', 'everynumber', 'knows', 'about', 'summer', 'digit', 'diagnosed', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'worst', 'thing', 'truly', 'has', 'happened', 'hnumberstly', 'so', 'devastated', 'so', 'summer', 'process', 'moving', 'already', 'just', 'made', 'everything', 'so', 'month', 'digit', 'went', 'on', 'plane', 'boston', 'no', 'joke', 'day', 'met', 'doctors', 'massachusetts', 'general', 'hospital', 'confirmed', 'had', 'so', 'entire', 'summer', 'busy', 'kicking', 'cancers', 'ass', 'took', 'like', 'absolute', 'champ', 'moved', 'northfield', 'vermont', 'started', 'school', 'montpelier', 'high', 'school', 'know', 'military', 'kids', 'know', 'making', 'friends', 'not', 'easiest', 'thing', 'do', 'there', 'few', 'kids', 'welcomed', 'say', 'thank', 'so', 'much', 'actually', 'means', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'throughout', 'school', 'year', 'quite', 'hard', 'not', 'only', 'keep', 'up', 'all', 'classes', 'junior', 'year', 'also', 'trying', 'get', 'school', 'ofnumber', 'possible', 'quite', 'difficult', 'well', 'also', 'met', 'probably', 'number', 'best', 'perfamrel', 'friend', 'savannah', 'tedder', 'kept', 'out', 'relationship', 'pretty', 'private', 'just', 'want', 'say', 'has', 'helped', 'out', 'last', 'digit', 'months', 'so', 'much', 'means', 'so', 'much', 'also', 'had', 'many', 'many', 'awesome', 'opportunities', 'year', 'including', 'meeting', 'david', 'ortiz', 'some', 'world', 'champion', 'red', 'sox', 'players', 'shitty', 'year', 'has', 'been', 'I am', 'glad', 'had', 'some', 'once', 'lifetime', 'experiences', 'on', 'month', 'digitish', 'finished', 'final', 'stretch', 'treatment', 'up', 'until', 'point', 'had', 'finished', 'both', 'chemo', 'therapy', 'radiation', 'treatment', 'finally', 'on', 'month', 'digit', 'had', 'final', 'full', 'body', 'scans', 'everything', 'had', 'come', 'back', 'positive', 'absolutely', 'no', 'signs', 'so', 'any', 'evidence', 'indication', 'cancer', 'cells', 'so', 'it is', 'official', 'now', 'cancer', 'free']",story now cancer free good time tell everynumber news tell so not everynumber knows about summer digit diagnosed ewing sarcoma worst thing truly has happened hnumberstly so devastated so summer process moving already just made everything so month digit went on plane boston no joke day met doctors massachusetts general hospital confirmed had so entire summer busy kicking cancers ass took like absolute champ moved northfield vermont started school montpelier high school know military kids know making friends not easiest thing do there few kids welcomed say thank so much actually means so much so throughout school year quite hard not only keep up all classes junior year also trying get school ofnumber possible quite difficult well also met probably number best perfamrel friend savannah tedder kept out relationship pretty private just want say has helped out last digit months so much means so much also had many many awesome opportunities year including meeting david ortiz some world champion red sox players shitty year has been I am glad had some once lifetime experiences on month digitish finished final stretch treatment up until point had finished both chemo therapy radiation treatment finally on month digit had final full body scans everything had come back positive absolutely no signs so any evidence indication cancer cells so it is official now cancer free

786,My cancer is back,"I was cancer free for over a year. Now it’s back. I don’t even know what to think. I feel numb.


Update:
So I posted this about exactly a week ago. Since then a number of things have happened.

My original cancer was a freaky, super rare type of sinus cancer, with metastasis to lymph nodes on my neck. I underwent a massive round of surgeries last year, as well as radiation and chemo. Since then quarterly checkups have shown no signs of it still being there.

This summer I noticed the tiniest red bump on my shoulder/back. Like a mosquito bite, and that was what I thought it was for a long time. But it never went away, it was itchy and I had a history of cancer.

I showed it to three different doctors, including my ENT, who all said this was nothing to worry about, but they removed it and sent it to histology just in case. And guess what, it was cancerous... That was the bleak message I got on Sunday/Monday a week ago.

So this Wednesday I got a call from the hospital, where they had already set up both a «scanning day» and surgery for me. Thursday I did several scans and had physical checks by plastic surgeons. Friday I had surgery where they removed a huge chunk of skin around the bump that I had already removed, all the way down to the muscle as it went deep. They also took out a lymph node from under my arm. They are going to check it for metastasis, and I will be notified in a couple of weeks. If it is cancerous I’ll need further treatments and more surgery.

The thing is, they say this is a new type of cancer, not even related to my first! Apparently it’s an atypical malign melanoma, with cancer cells that are hard to define(?)

So I’m sitting here like... I’m not even out of my 30’s, and I’m getting two (atypical) cancers in two years? What the hell is going on?

I do feel completely defeated at the moment. Last year I had the will to fight, and I fought it. I’m somewhat traumatized by the experience, but I fought it even though I knew my odds were low. This time it feels different. I’ve struggled with PTSD and depression since last time, as well as other aspects in life have hit me pretty hard. It’s like I don’t even care what happens to my body, or if I even survive. Even if this time my odds are a lot better, it just feels like I have less to fight for.

I guess I’m still in shock, and shouldn’t be so hard on myself. Hoping it gets better. Heavy painkillers are probably messing with my mind as well.

789,A hero,"Today, 

Standing messy haired 

And rumple clothed in the supermarket

I felt the eyes of a stranger

Dissatisfied with my appearance 

And I thought 

“Are you a hero?”

I think this often

Everyday 

When a customer is annoyed

That they have to wait so long at the bar 

And now I’ve poured the wrong beer

I think

“Are you a hero?”

When I’m not replying 

To an enquiry made online 

And the acquaintance seems angry 

I think 

“Are you a hero?”

When I look worn and dishevelled

And I make mistakes 

When I forget simple things 

And all it does is frustrate 

I think 

“Are you a hero?”

My mother is dying 

And I cannot save her 

I am no hero

Maybe that’s you? 

And if you are a hero 

Can you save me too?

790,My dad has stage 3 lung cancer,"So my dad went to urgent care for a cough that wouldn’t go away and after a few scans later he was diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer. It’s in his left lung and lymph nodes in his chest near his heart. 

My dad is 72 and I think he’s been struggling with depression for a few years. He has never seen anyone for it or been treated for it. My sister brought up his mental state to his primary physician recently before his diagnosis and he was prescribed anti depressants. 

We’re scheduled to see the oncologist on Friday but just today he said he is done and just wished to die. He doesn’t want to see the doctors. This upset me on so many levels. Is it wrong of me to try to convince him? How can he decide to quit when the fight hasn’t even started? I know he’s scared and anxious, but what can I say to convince him to already hear the doctors out about what can be done? 

It’s such bad timing with his state of mind to try and fight cancer. He hasn’t been exercising for quite sometime and his muscles have slowly atrophied. He struggles to walk. 

I’m not sure his body or mind will let him do chemo. Is radiation just as tough? Targeted therapy? Immunotherapy?

I’m all over the place. I’m venting but also asking for suggestions. Please help.

794,A complete failure of my duty,"I take care of my grandmother who has been battling lung cancer since January. Her health has been in heavy decline since October, which has lead us to a partially collapsed lung last week, but she has been determined to be as self sufficient as possible. My grandfather also moved in temporarily while we all endure this as they live 2 hours away and my home is minutes from her oncologist and chemo center. Today she drove my grandfather on a 1 hour each way trip for his veterans hospital check up and when I got home she and he had already gone to bed. 

I had been up since early today and took a nap when I got home, I was awakened by my grandparents dog barking and my grandfather rushed in to tell me my grandma had passed. I went to her room and she was cold and contorted, pulse was extremely weak and breathing was not present. I had my gf call emergency while I went to my godparents home next door for a defibrillator, running across the yards in socks. 

I was told by my grandfather to not touch her as he believed she was gone. I broke down crying in my kitchen as my godmother and her son came in ( they run a daycare out of home and have emergency training), they relented against my grandfather and moved her flat on her back and with a couple compressions she started a hoarse breathing pattern. 

Emergency services arrived and now I'm in the hospital waiting room. I deferred to others against my better judgement and entered a panic state, which could have cost her life.

795,Cancer is such a lonely journey,"Im a relatively young (25) adult with ovarian cancer, after telling my friends about my diagnosis I've noticed they become more distant, anyone ever experience this?

It doesn't help that people my age are usually busy with their lives (career/socialising) , I can't join them for the usual outings anymore (eating out, bars, physical activities, normal 25 yo stuff etc) because I'm still having treatment. Its been months since I've seen anyone in person. 

They use to check in and hang out with me after the first few sessions but as time went on I notice they didnt even bother asking anymore, maybe because I always told them I was fine after the first few chemo sessions so they kinda assumed Im still fine now?

But it still kinda hurts that nobody bothers to drop by/check in anymore, worst thing is I know everyone still hangs out with each other occasionally just without me (they're open about it so its not behind my back). I'd have mixed feelings if they threw me a party for completing my treatments because I can't shake this feeling of abandonment. 

Am I just overthinking this, can't help feeling Im being selfish :/

Ps. I have a very supportive family so it's not all bad.

799,My (19) mum (54) is in her last days with an aggressive brain and lung cancer,"It has all happened very fast, she was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer that spread to 2 areas in her brain just 1 year ago after she went to the doctors with some twitching and pain in her shoulder and it has been a gradual decline since then. 

She is in a type of coma now and has been for about 5 days, just breathing very shallow and very fast, no food or liquid at all we just wet her mouth with a swab throughout the day. 

Is there anything I can do to make sure she is as comfortable as possible? She doesn’t groan or frown and there is good air circulation in the room, the doctor said was all good news but I really want to make sure she isn’t in any discomfort.

We don’t want her to be alone when the time comes for her to go, me and my sister (23) sleep in the same room with her but how will we know when the time is close? Do all patients have the death rattle at the end of life even if she is already on medication to reduce the fluid buildup in her lungs and throat? Are there any other signs in the last days/hours?

800,The pain of losing a parent to this disease,"I remember when I first found out my father was diagnosed. He hid a lot from me to protect me from the bad news. I don’t blame him. I remember he would go days without talking to me because he didn’t want me to see him going bald from the chemo. He didn’t want me to watch him die. He loved me so much. 

I left for California for a few weeks and came back to him in the hospital. I never would have went to California if I knew that was going to be the last time I saw my father outside of a hospital. I didn’t see him for weeks. When I came back, I got the news that he was jaundice. I ran to the hospital and he was so yellow, so skinny, throwing up, and just angry at the world. 

The damn doctors came in and started talking about hospice right in front of him. I was the only one who had faith he’d get better. 

My family tried to talk some sense into me, but I refused to believe he was dying. He’s my father, he raised me, he’s not dying. 

I remember trying to let loose at the club, but was just always constantly looking at my phone. I started crying in the club and just lost it. 

The morning before he died, I gave him a speech, he was so high off drugs but I knew he could hear me. I told him how much I loved him and how I promised to take care of things. My nose started to bleed from crying so hard. I told him to wait for me for when I got out of work. He did. I held his hand and watched him take his last breath. 

Everyone was crying, but I just couldn’t. I cried in my car and screamed on my way back home. I didn’t want to cry in front of anyone. Even at his funeral, I just refused to cry. 

But I just always want to cry. The pain is still there and I miss him more than anything in the world. He made sure I was well taken care of before he left. And I will always be thankful for that. 

I wish I could cry about him to someone, but I just can’t. I want to cry in someone’s lap and just have my head rubbed. But I just can’t.

He was always so proud of me. When everyone doubted me, or thought I wasn’t capable of doing something, he was the one to support my every decision. He knew I could reach the stars. 

And now that I am, he’s not here to see it. I finally got a job that he would be so freakin proud of. I left my toxic relationship which he knew I deserved better. He always knew I deserved better. He would talk about me to his friends as if he was my biggest fan. 

My life is changing and I’m happy, but he’s not here to say “I knew you could do it”. 

Why did it have to be him? I hold no anger towards people who successfully beat cancer, but I get envious of hearing those stories. My father tried, until he just couldn’t. The chemo killed him. 

I know many people feel the pain I’m feeling - which comforts me. I’m not alone.

805,"Does anyone else feel left out when their loved one is feeling ""good""?","I've been talking to multiple people about this and I'm really struggling to feel better.

My boyfriend has cancer and has been doing treatment since April. Things are going very well and he may be getting surgery soon. We have been friends for years and started dating November of last year. He was not feeling good for a long time and finally got diagnosed in March of this year. So I've been by his side through all of it. 

What that looks like is talking to his team, helping with his parents, and helping him as much as possible. I'm also still working full time as my job hasn't been shut down. I've also been doing school and now studying for a licensing test. I've moved in that time too. So it's a lot.

What's really hurting me is days like yesterday. He got chemo on Thursday and usually he feels like shit for the next week, of course. I saw him on Friday night and brought him Lego (I do that after every round), then took him to the store so we could get something to make for dinner. Everything was good and I told him I would come over Saturday (yesterday) to be there for him and study for my test on Wednesday. We've been talking about that for the past couple weeks since I scheduled it. He was supportive of me studying with him there and bouncing things off him because that helps me remember the things I've learned. Of course I would not bother him with it if it ended up that he felt like shit and couldn't handle that.

So yesterday I go for a run in the morning/early afternoon thinking he's probably sleeping and not feeling well. When I get back he tells me he's gone out of town for a drive and to walk around another town. I was extremely hurt and upset that he would do that without me and that he just pretended to forget that the plan was for me to come over and study and then watch a movie together. I told him it feels like I am always there for him when he feels like shit and then when he feels good I'm left out. He also works on the weekends he's feeling good. So the last time we did anything fun out in public was weeks ago. 

He got really defensive, said I ruined his day, made him feel like shit, etc. I am trying my absolute best to support him at all times. I know I'm doing a pretty good job. And I do support him doing things he enjoys when he feels good. He has every day of the week to do things without me and the days I have off that he feels good he goes and does something that I have wanted to do with him since the whole thing started. 

I told him how I felt and he semi apologized. I also apologized that my first reaction wasn't that I was happy he was feeling good but honestly it wasn't my first reaction. I am still struggling not to feel underappreciated and unloved by this. He tries to tell me I need to do my own things too. And I do, but I want to spend time with him when he's good too and I don't think that's unhealthy. I really, really don't want to feel this way. 

Any help really appreciated. I'm just sad and I'm scared for what our relationship is going to look like when it's done (God willing) and he's better.",5.0,"['does', 'anynumber', 'else', 'feel', 'left', 'out', 'when', 'loved',

I haven't ever really had any experience with cancer before. My dad is quite shaken and is getting depressed. He's lost 30 pounds in just under a month from feeling sick.

I have no idea how to help him. Or my mom. Or how to tell my son what's happening, should it get worse. I guess for now we wait to find out what stage he is and to get the mass removed.

Sorry this got so long. My brain just feels like it's going to explode, and I just needed to get this out. Nobody else in my family really knows outside of my brother, and my husband.

810,Not at 35,"""They found a mass in my colon, the doctor says that it's likely cancer.""  The words rang through my ears and I felt everything around me reeling for a moment.  Not at 35.  We have children, two boys who are just aged 6 and 1. Our plan was to have another baby when the youngest went on to pre-k but slowly I felt that dream slip away.  We had been putting off a vacation to Europe to see some of my husband's family there for when the kids are older, because we thought that we'd have the time.  I slowly mulled over a dozen things that we planned to do once our children were older and now....I knew.  I felt it in my gut that it wasn't an early stage.  I can't explain how, I just knew. Two days later we planned an impromptu family outing to have a little quality time before the chaos of appointments,  surgery and chemo began. We never made it, on the way the vomiting began and the loss of blood. 4 days in the hospital and a few appointments later my fears were confirmed, stage 4 cancer.  

I can't explain the dread that I have now.  I am typically the person who sees the bright side of any situation, who doesn't realize that things were really hard until I reflect back on what I've been through.  Now, I don't feel like we have more than a few years with my husband.  It's an overwhelming feeling that doesn't feel in anyway like pessimism but more like a premonition.  I don't dare share this feeling with anyone else and I constantly adopt a brave ""we're going to fight this"" demeanor; I feel guilty though, that I'm not blindly optimistic like my family and friends around us and I have a very deep feeling of dread for what the future holds.  Is this completely crazy?

811,"Cancer took my mom, now I’m overprotective of my dad.","Hi, I’m not sure if this post belongs here, if not can you direct me on where I can post to get advice. 

My mom passed away last month. She had stage four, gastrointestinal cancer and was just diagnosed in feb. The cancer was too far for any treatment to help. I lost my best friend and I’m struggling. 
I noticed that I have become very stressed over my dad’s health lately. I freak out over anything he has. I’m so scared to lose him too. A couple years ago, he had a brain tumor, but it hasn’t been a problem since his operations in 2012. He’s 49 years old, and been kinda healthy over all, so I don’t know why I’m stressing so much. 

I’m 26 years old. It’s just me and my dad living together. My younger brother moved out for work, and is leaving for the marines in a couple of months. I’m just worried. I’m a mess.

812,Do you have ways of coping?,"Bit of back story, my dad was diagnosed with myeloma 13 years ago, eventually he died of bowel cancer 17 months ago. My mum was diagnosed with breast cancer 10 years ago, fortunately they caught it quickly, she had an op and that was that. Last Thursday mum was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). I am an only child with no other family members around for support. So I'm having to take time off from work at the mo whilst she's in hospital recovering from an op to have a stent fitted. She had a biopsy of her liver which we haven't had the results back yet but I understand prognosis for this type of cancer isn't great (to say the least). 

My friends have been really good recently and I know I cannot always rely on them, but today I'm really down and no one is free, I've drank almost a bottle of wine to myself and I wish I hadn't, but also it's given me an opportunity for the first time since mum's most recent diagnosis to cry, which can only be a cathartic thing. 

I just wondered what everyone else does to cope? I should add I'm not at all reliant on alcohol, but maybe once a week I'll indulge in some wine, usually it's every two weeks. 

Mum was always sole carer for my dad, but now the responsibility is on me for mum, and I always feel like I have to maintain this ""strong"" persona. I also have a 6 year old that lives with her dad (because of my lack of family support when my dad was dying) and her dad and my ex-MIL have been really good about it all (we aren't together anymore) but I've not been able to see her like I normally would whilst mum has been in hospital which has made me feel such guilt, which doesn't help. Add to that the guilt of me not being able to work for the last week or so. I feel like I'm living a nightmare. 

Also perhaps I should mention that I have never quite gotten over the death of my dad, it still gives me nightmares and some things have happened in caring for my mum that have triggered me and taken me back to that time. So I'm not really sure how to deal with that going forward. 

Should say I'm in the UK. But yeah, how did you all manage to look after yourselves? Sorry if I'm rambling.

818,UNIFIED COVID-19 STUDY INVITATION,"Hello members of r/CancerFamilySupport!

During this unprecedented times the COVID-19 pandemic has brought tremendous challenges for individuals who need complex and continual care. People living with serious conditions may weaken their ability to fight infections, making them more vulnerable to COVID-19. These include individuals with cancer and those needing organ transplants.

If you know of anyone who has been diagnosed with cancer we invite you to share our study with your loved ones! We plan to survey and interview individuals with cancer to explore how they are receiving care during the pandemic. Please click on the link below to take our survey and find out more about our study! [https://www.unifiedcovid.com/](https://www.unifiedcovid.com/)

Our study aims to explore the following topics: whether public responses to combat the pandemic have caused changes to their treatment, and how current circumstances have impacted their mental health. Understanding these challenges will help doctors and decision makers optimize care delivery to these vulnerable individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

Thank you very much for your time and if you have further questions, please feel free to contact [louisega@mail.ubc.ca](mailto:louisega@mail.ubc.ca) or (604)-822-5697

819,Feel so alone - rant of feelings not expecting any responses just didn’t know where to post my pain,"My Mother has terminal PPC, has had surgery and lots of chemo to prolong and has been through sepsis and ICU stay in Winter 2018-  we thought we were losing her. She was dx in Spring 2018. Bowel obstructions have been her main issue. 
She has had increasing pains, that are thought to be cancer regrowing where it’s been shrunk before and she’s constantly sick and got aches- sometimes she’s alright and until the pain last week was painting walls and what have you.
She’s been shielding for 12 weeks, we haven’t seen her for 14. I had my first baby in January so she could be a Nan and I could have her around. Then covid hit and has taken so much precious time I’m utterly crushed inside. She’s met her twice in four months of her little life. We live too far for window waving and she got to the point it would break her heart to see us so far away. 

So she’s been moved to a hospice from hospital to symptom manage, hopefully for three weeks or less. She can’t manage at home. Oncologist has reluctantly agreed to a regime of Caelyx- if she can overcome this breakthrough pain.

I’m utterly heartbroken. She is a single parent, no other family. My sister is 18 and lives with her and the dog, and our other sister is 25 (doesn’t really make any effort and hasn’t since diagnosis to spend any time with her, despite nearly losing her and being begged by our Mum to spend some time together-). 18 yo doesn’t have a dad or other family she will be left alone.
Mine and our useless sisters Dad has helped a bit but through me texting and asking as he lives a few miles away.
His family is what I thought my family too. But my siblings haven’t even been in touch to ask how I am or any of us. In fact they’ve never bothered since Mum was diagnosed. Anyone will tell you ive tried loads. They have stayed at mine  and I always make effort. Never anything back. Self absorbed teens. My baby girl has come along and still nothing. Annoyed I wouldn’t allow photos on IG because clearly, my baby is all about their attention. My baby hasn’t been well on a few occasions and no one has been in touch. Now this is happening and I feel alone.
I have my Oh for support. We are executors of the Will and from the beginning I’ve had to do everything and face the realities, fight for her to remain on ventilation in ICU. I’m in oncology meetings, as a support. It’s as if people see me as some robot who isn’t allowed emotions.
Of us three girls I am closest to her. 
She loves her granddaughter and it’s painful to see her so sore and so sad on FaceTime.

Today my sisters were awful on Twitter- radio silence for months as usual (until they want somewhere to stay for a concert etc then they’re in touch as I live in a big city.) 

I don’t know why. This whole BLM movement is amazing but they’ve gone from not caring about anyone but themselves to performist activism and I feel like screaming “hello your eldest sister is lonely and sad in lockdown miles away with a new baby and mother in hospice?” So because I RT someone’s (fair) comment about social distancing not being honoured at protests and how this is upsetting those who are shielding and are frightened. A second spike will inevitably mean we can’t say goodbye or hold her. If we can’t see her and she passes in that hospice I might never recover from that pain.
I retweeted, I have no comment on the BLM I’m not fighting for that I can’t see beyond my day with my baby girl and this situation. 
She is 16 and commented a nasty comment, as if I didn’t care about the cause.
Now five minutes ago these teenagers couldn’t give a damn and had no idea or maturity to understand the gravity of institutional racism. It’s insulting to imply I don’t. The movement is happening- you can still see how social distancing being broken is a concern for people like us who will pay the ultimate price of not seeing shielded relatives.
I’m so upset I didn’t response and the other two siblings liked it. I deleted my twitter.
I already feel so lonely in this. I’ve been abused emotionally throughout this by one of my sisters.
It’s a mess. Friends don’t want to know. They text at first, offered a zoom chat today and i just wanted a friendly chat and said so, to take my mind off my sadness. No replies when I pushed. They’re bored of my depressing situation.
I put my baby down on Sunday with my partner and walked out. I was close to walking out in front of a bus. The thought of my baby brought me back round.
I can’t have these feelings aloud- My OH is amazing and if it wasn’t for him I wouldn’t have made it this far. His family don’t really ask after me or our baby, feels like they’re only interested in when she’s older or something. Not in her baby years it’s pretty irritating. They don’t ask my OH how he is coping. Now my own siblings who never cared before are actively against me? When all my life I’ve given up a lot, to spend time with them. Now they’re old enough to be rude they just are with no respect.
I feel very alone. I don’t know what to do. I will be taking up counselling this time to cope as it’s not fair on my baby but I know I’ll be left to pick up the pieces. 
I think the fact I’m so hurt, I feel sick with the pain inside. I’ve lost four pounds this week in weight. 

I don’t expect any replies. I need to get this off my chest, and just say how sad and frightened and bitter I am

I am hoping she gets out of there. But I’ve little optimism left when I’ve seen how vulgar people who you expect to support you actually are. Just no communication.

824,Some kind of support?,"I will probably delete this but just really needed to vent.

How do you deal with having a family member with incurable cancer but they were abusive to their family when we were younger? 

We’ve “reconciled” as in the rest of us just moved on and sweep it under the rug but it’s still hard to deal with the lasting impacts of the abuses while still feeling love towards them.  And I hate the fact that towards the end in the future, how much it’ll personally hurt to see them suffer and dying from cancer but still dealing with all the past anger and resentment towards them. 

I hate that they will have the control and power over me forever.  

And before someone jumped on saying it’s not right. Abused victims will never and can’t just “get over it” towards their abuser. We will always have PTSD and other mental repercussions from it. We just learn how to cope and deal with it, especially if it’s close family member we still maintain relationships with. 

Am I the only one feeling this way? I don’t even know if I’m expressing this correctly. 

And if I should seek out professional help, what methods and type of therapy should I look for or research?

826,It’s happening so quick,"It’s been a week since I found out my grandad has cancer. We suspected it, after he got sick incredibly quickly roughly a month and a half ago. On Tuesday, he had another appointment and we received a heavy blow - they won’t treat it nor will they carry out tests to find out what specific type of cancer it is. They believe it’s related to the early ship building industry. As he’s at such a high risk, they don’t want him in hospital due to covid. And if they did operate, he’s on blood thinners so he’d bleed a lot which is another reason for them not wanting to treat him. 

Yesterday my mother rang me to say she was getting my grandads prescription and that it was his end of life medication and I am heart broken. I haven’t seen him in a month because of this awful pandemic we’re in and now I’m terrified I won’t see him again. He’s not my biological grandfather, but he’s the only one who’s cared for me like he is.

827,"Caregiving and COVID (29, m)","A month ago, my wife (29) was diagnosed with breast cancer. We've already done a lumpectomy and sentinel lymph biopsy. They found cancer in one of her lymph nodes, putting her in stage 1B/2A. It's hormone responsive and HER2 negative. We just got oncotype and genetic results back that are leading us to do a 20-week chemo treatment and a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy. Because the chemo and impending hormone therapy are going to severely limit fertility, we're also starting the process of freezing eggs before starting chemo. All of this is to say I'm overwhelmed with the medical stuff currently. 

COVID is really making everything harder right now. We live in Nebraska and our governor is pushing hard for a rapid re-opening because he wants our college football stadium at 100% capacity by the fall. I feel trapped in the house. We can't really spend time with friends/family like we want (besides some back yard hangs, which - if I can be honest - are becoming rather unfulfilling). I just feel like a non-person right now, just a to-do list that I'm not writing. All my autonomy or any activity that was a pleasure for me is off the table. I dreaded waking up this morning because I know the most significant decision I get to make today is what i'm having for lunch.

843,I’m not ready.,"In 2016 I was diagnosed with stage 4 of a severely aggressive bone cancer after months of severe pain in my sacrum and left leg. I was diagnosed the month before I turned 16. 

Ewing’s Sarcoma. Rare, and even rarer to have it where I did. One big angry tumour in my sacrum, wrapping around all the nerves in my leg. 
I named her Shannon. 

So because it was an aggressive cancer, we needed to hit it with an even more aggressive chemo protocol. The protocol I was under would have killed an adult, but because I was/am a kid, it only severely harmed me. I was bedridden for the full year and a bit of treatment. 

I did 36 radiation fractions, and 11 rounds of chemo in my induction phase, and then a round every three weeks for a year. It was supposed to be every 2 weeks, but because it was hurting my body and threatening my blood counts so much, we had to add an extra week of recovery time. 

It was the most horrible year of my life. All my friends were out partying and dating and having fun, and I was so sick I couldn’t even go to school. I was barely conscious at all. A few of my friends were amazing during it all and stuck by me, doing everything and anything to help the stress on me and my family. They were bloody amazing, and i’m never going to be able to repay them for making my year that bit easier. 

Halfway through treatment, I was admitted to the ICU after a few scary low blood pressure readings. I basically lived in hospital all year so it wasn’t much of a bother. I couldn’t really grasp how sick I was for those 8 days in the ICU until I overheard nurses talking about how if I hadn’t have made it down there that night, I would have died. 

So a few major emergency surgeries later and another few months of treatment, I made it. 

I did it. I got my N.E.D (No Evidence of Disease, because there’s never a certain “you’re cancer free” with Ewings) January this year. I’d won. 
During my recovery, I went to physio and learnt how to walk again and got stronger. I even made it to school for a few days. 

And then the pain started. This time in my ribs on my right side. We treated the pain for a while, and then it was time for my 6 month check up scans. 
I lit up EVERYWHERE. 

I had a massive tumour in my spine, wrapping around my spinal cord and causing the pain in my ribs. 
There were tumours in my ankles and legs and shoulders and lungs. 
It was official. I’m terminal. 

There’s no way to stop it, and I’m currently on more treatment to at least slow it down and buy me some time. 

I’m dying. I’m 17 - 18 in a few months. I’m not ready to die. I can’t. I can’t leave my family and friends behind. 

My mum is my entire world. I love her more than anything and owe her everything I have and ever will have. She’s everything I could ever hope to be and I’m leaving her. She has to lose her daughter. I can’t do that to her. 

I’ve got an older sister - my best friend in the world. I can’t leave her either. We promised we’d grow old together. We promised we’d spoil each other’s kids. 

And then there’s my 12 year old brother - my baby. I’m supposed to look after him, to protect him. And I won’t be able to do that. He’s 12 for Christ’s sake he can’t lose his sister. I can’t do that to him - he should be worrying about not having enough v-bucks on fortnite for the new skin, not about how he’s going to deal with everything when his older sister fucking dies. 

And my half siblings, a 6 year old sister and a 2 year old brother. I love them more than anything in the entire world. My sister is my best friend and I’m hers. She looks up to me and I can’t leave her. I was supposed to watch them grow up and help her sneak out when she was older. I was supposed to be there to help them with homework and relationship trouble. 
And now I can’t. 

I’ll never see any of my younger siblings graduate or get their first girlfriends or boyfriends. I’ll never see them get married. I’ll never meet their kids. 

And the worst part is that they’re all so young that they’re gonna forget me. 
For the 12 year old, he’ll remember me, but over the years it’s gonna get harder and harder to remember the times we’ve fought or played or bickered. He won’t remember my mannerisms or the times we’d spend hanging out in my room. 
And the babies won’t remember anything about me. That’s what’s breaking my heart. 
All the games and the stories and the lullabies and the secrets - gone. They won’t remember anything. I’ll just be the older sister they never knew that passed away when she was a teenager. 

I can’t leave my family behind. I just can’t do it. I’m not ready. 

And my best friend. The friend that I was planning to move out after school with. The friend that has stuck by me the most. The friend that was ready to carry my children because I couldn’t anymore (thanks to the radiation). The friend that I was going to grow old with and bicker with endlessly. 
I’m not going to have her anymore. And again, I’ll just be the friend she had when she was young that passed away. 

I can’t do this. I don’t want to do this. But I don’t have a choice. 

My doctor said he’d be surprised if I made it to the end of the year. That’s 2 months. 
2 months to say my goodbyes and to make as many memories as I can with as many of my loved ones as I can. 
I’m not ready. Please god please I just don’t want to die. 

I just needed to vent to someone, anyone. I’m sorry. It’s 1am and everyone’s asleep, and I didn’t want to burden my mum by letting her know I’m feeling like this right now. She worries too much as it is. 


***UPDATE*** 
So I’m still here, as you can tell. I’ve been fighting like hell, and it definitely hasn’t been easy - but I’m okay. 
I’m doing well actually (head wise, at least). Pain is under control, nausea is under control and all that Jazz. 
I’ve stopped chemo, because towards the end it had just stopped working altogether. So for now we just zap any problematic tumours with radiation if they start causing too much pain / too many problems. 

I’ve recently had a fall, and really smacked my right foot. So it’s been out of action for about a week now, but i’m slowly recovering. 
I’ve also been on oxygen for a couple months now because my lungs just aren’t doing the job completely. Nothing too bad; as in I could technically go without the oxygen’s help - it just wouldn’t be too fun. 

Otherwise... I’ve really been okay. (Just don’t ask about my dad. Ugh. Lmao)
We all know my time’s coming, but if the time since I’ve made this post has meant anything - it means I can fight a little longer, as long as I’ve got my family and friends behind me. 

I appreciate all of you guys that have stuck by me and sent in your continuous support. It was always crazy sweet reading your messages and always really uplifting. So thank you. 

Here’s to this not being my last update, either!
