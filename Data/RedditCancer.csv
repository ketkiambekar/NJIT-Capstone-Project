I’m not ready.,615,9isza1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/9isza1/im_not_ready/,82,1537917201.0,"In 2016 I was diagnosed with stage 4 of a severely aggressive bone cancer after months of severe pain in my sacrum and left leg. I was diagnosed the month before I turned 16. 

Ewing’s Sarcoma. Rare, and even rarer to have it where I did. One big angry tumour in my sacrum, wrapping around all the nerves in my leg. 
I named her Shannon. 

So because it was an aggressive cancer, we needed to hit it with an even more aggressive chemo protocol. The protocol I was under would have killed an adult, but because I was/am a kid, it only severely harmed me. I was bedridden for the full year and a bit of treatment. 

I did 36 radiation fractions, and 11 rounds of chemo in my induction phase, and then a round every three weeks for a year. It was supposed to be every 2 weeks, but because it was hurting my body and threatening my blood counts so much, we had to add an extra week of recovery time. 

It was the most horrible year of my life. All my friends were out partying and dating and having fun, and I was so sick I couldn’t even go to school. I was barely conscious at all. A few of my friends were amazing during it all and stuck by me, doing everything and anything to help the stress on me and my family. They were bloody amazing, and i’m never going to be able to repay them for making my year that bit easier. 

Halfway through treatment, I was admitted to the ICU after a few scary low blood pressure readings. I basically lived in hospital all year so it wasn’t much of a bother. I couldn’t really grasp how sick I was for those 8 days in the ICU until I overheard nurses talking about how if I hadn’t have made it down there that night, I would have died. 

So a few major emergency surgeries later and another few months of treatment, I made it. 

I did it. I got my N.E.D (No Evidence of Disease, because there’s never a certain “you’re cancer free” with Ewings) January this year. I’d won. 
During my recovery, I went to physio and learnt how to walk again and got stronger. I even made it to school for a few days. 

And then the pain started. This time in my ribs on my right side. We treated the pain for a while, and then it was time for my 6 month check up scans. 
I lit up EVERYWHERE. 

I had a massive tumour in my spine, wrapping around my spinal cord and causing the pain in my ribs. 
There were tumours in my ankles and legs and shoulders and lungs. 
It was official. I’m terminal. 

There’s no way to stop it, and I’m currently on more treatment to at least slow it down and buy me some time. 

I’m dying. I’m 17 - 18 in a few months. I’m not ready to die. I can’t. I can’t leave my family and friends behind. 

My mum is my entire world. I love her more than anything and owe her everything I have and ever will have. She’s everything I could ever hope to be and I’m leaving her. She has to lose her daughter. I can’t do that to her. 

I’ve got an older sister - my best friend in the world. I can’t leave her either. We promised we’d grow old together. We promised we’d spoil each other’s kids. 

And then there’s my 12 year old brother - my baby. I’m supposed to look after him, to protect him. And I won’t be able to do that. He’s 12 for Christ’s sake he can’t lose his sister. I can’t do that to him - he should be worrying about not having enough v-bucks on fortnite for the new skin, not about how he’s going to deal with everything when his older sister fucking dies. 

And my half siblings, a 6 year old sister and a 2 year old brother. I love them more than anything in the entire world. My sister is my best friend and I’m hers. She looks up to me and I can’t leave her. I was supposed to watch them grow up and help her sneak out when she was older. I was supposed to be there to help them with homework and relationship trouble. 
And now I can’t. 

I’ll never see any of my younger siblings graduate or get their first girlfriends or boyfriends. I’ll never see them get married. I’ll never meet their kids. 

And the worst part is that they’re all so young that they’re gonna forget me. 
For the 12 year old, he’ll remember me, but over the years it’s gonna get harder and harder to remember the times we’ve fought or played or bickered. He won’t remember my mannerisms or the times we’d spend hanging out in my room. 
And the babies won’t remember anything about me. That’s what’s breaking my heart. 
All the games and the stories and the lullabies and the secrets - gone. They won’t remember anything. I’ll just be the older sister they never knew that passed away when she was a teenager. 

I can’t leave my family behind. I just can’t do it. I’m not ready. 

And my best friend. The friend that I was planning to move out after school with. The friend that has stuck by me the most. The friend that was ready to carry my children because I couldn’t anymore (thanks to the radiation). The friend that I was going to grow old with and bicker with endlessly. 
I’m not going to have her anymore. And again, I’ll just be the friend she had when she was young that passed away. 

I can’t do this. I don’t want to do this. But I don’t have a choice. 

My doctor said he’d be surprised if I made it to the end of the year. That’s 2 months. 
2 months to say my goodbyes and to make as many memories as I can with as many of my loved ones as I can. 
I’m not ready. Please god please I just don’t want to die. 

I just needed to vent to someone, anyone. I’m sorry. It’s 1am and everyone’s asleep, and I didn’t want to burden my mum by letting her know I’m feeling like this right now. She worries too much as it is. 


***UPDATE*** 
So I’m still here, as you can tell. I’ve been fighting like hell, and it definitely hasn’t been easy - but I’m okay. 
I’m doing well actually (head wise, at least). Pain is under control, nausea is under control and all that Jazz. 
I’ve stopped chemo, because towards the end it had just stopped working altogether. So for now we just zap any problematic tumours with radiation if they start causing too much pain / too many problems. 

I’ve recently had a fall, and really smacked my right foot. So it’s been out of action for about a week now, but i’m slowly recovering. 
I’ve also been on oxygen for a couple months now because my lungs just aren’t doing the job completely. Nothing too bad; as in I could technically go without the oxygen’s help - it just wouldn’t be too fun. 

Otherwise... I’ve really been okay. (Just don’t ask about my dad. Ugh. Lmao)
We all know my time’s coming, but if the time since I’ve made this post has meant anything - it means I can fight a little longer, as long as I’ve got my family and friends behind me. 

I appreciate all of you guys that have stuck by me and sent in your continuous support. It was always crazy sweet reading your messages and always really uplifting. So thank you. 

Here’s to this not being my last update, either!

"Diagnosed in June, Dead in August",437,cuo28h,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/cuo28h/diagnosed_in_june_dead_in_august/,49,1566644429.0,"My wonderful husband was diagnosed with cancer in June. In August we did 10 days of radiation. Then Monday, August 19, we took him to see the surgeon about having a port placed for chemo. We knew the cancer had spread to many areas, but the oncologist thought that chemo would help extend his life. He couldn't stand up long enough to get from the car to the wheelchair. We had to get staff from the surgeon's office to help us get him into the wheelchair and into the doctor's office. The surgeon looked at him and sent us to the ER.

The ER staff moved us from a regular room to the trauma room. They found fluid around his heart. A few minutes after they went in to drain it, people started running into and out of the room. Literally running, not just walking fast. They got him somewhat stabilized and told us that we needed to get him to a hospital in the city (about 90 min by car). It was a rotten way to get a helicopter ride, and I am sure he didn't even get to enjoy it. The hospital had to intubate him to give him pain meds. He had been moaning and whining when they tried to drain the fluid from his heart. We heard it from outside the rood. So having him sent by air ambulance to the city was NOT good news. If it had just been his heart, his cardiologist could have handled it at the hospital at home. But his kidneys were not working, and we don't have a kidney doc at out hospital.

By the time I got to the hospital, he was in the ICU. The nurses and doctors were AMAZING. So caring, and not just about him. I finally managed to get away to find a hotel at about midnight. The next few days were a whirl of hospital, hotel, my mom and kids coming up to visit and/or stay, and my inlaws and his sister coming to visit. It was awful but also good.

On Wednesday we decided to let him go on Thursday afternoon. He and I had our 28th anniversary on the 10th, and on the 22nd I had to say goodbye. It just is so awful and painful.

After they took the tubes out, our sons read him to sleep. He spent many years reading stories to them, complete with all the voices. So our boys got a copy of one of my husband's favorite book series for kids (Hank the Cowdog) and they read until the end. It was the sweetest thing I have ever seen them do. One of the most loving things they could have done.",2019-08-24 11:00:29

I went to the ER for me but ended up staying and sitting with my chemo buddy till he passed...,406,a9wgqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/a9wgqi/i_went_to_the_er_for_me_but_ended_up_staying_and/,29,1545918551.0,"I was in a lot of pain and ended up going to the ER. While I was there, I saw “Charleston Chew”. He was my chemo buddy, as we were close in age and had pretty similar schedules. 
In his very crude and sarcastic way, he softly yelled “Hello my delicious Korean BBQ”, his nickname for me. I smiled, as he tried to chuck an ice chip at me. I could tell something was wrong because he looked and sounded weaker than usual. I asked the nurse why he was there and she couldn’t disclose anything but said in short, things weren’t looking good. After I got looked at and discharged, I went over to him.
I asked him what was up and he told me that he went to spend Christmas with his family and he wasn’t feeling well but wanted to give them that. He flew back and straight to the ER. He looked at me and asked if I’d stay with him but to go if I had plans cause “a girl who looks as hot as you with cancer, should have plans and be getting laid”. Our humor is (was) similar. I stayed and I told him about my holidays and he struggled to tell me about his... I think I knew what was happening because it took everything in me to not start breaking down and cry in front of him.

He told me about the first time we met. I had already been a regular and he was a fish out of water. He had Stage 4 lung cancer and was given 6-12 months to live. He didn’t understand why he was doing chemo, as he felt his quality of life was going to be shittier. But he saw a “delicious Korean BBQ” girl with a sassy attitude who he could make friends with and it made going back, a little easier every day. I didn’t know that... 
We are (were) both in our 30’s and talked about our life being on hold, while everyone else was busy getting married, popping babies, buying houses — as we impeded doom, death, and debt. Haha. 
The reason I called him Charleston Chew at the beginning was because he had an affinity for that damn candy. When he couldn’t eat anything else, you could count on him sucking on those damn things at any hour. I’m pretty sure that was his only nutrition for the past 8 months. One time he smiled and it was just melted chocolate and nougat, I nearly peed myself from laughter. 
When things got hard, we leaned on each other. When we got fed up with this whole process, we understood it. We could confide in one another. When we got stupid depressed and suicidal, we could go to one another without judgement. We also binge watched all of The Wire, Gilmore Girls, and Marvelous Mrs Maisel together. (Gilmore Girls was his pick) We became real friends. 
His support system was flying in from out of town and there would be times when he was alone, so I’d FaceTime him. He would try and convince me he had friends but I knew he had a hard time asking for help—- as I knew that feeling all too well. He’d joke that if he wasn’t dying, that some would consider what we were doing as “dating”. Haha. 

The doctors were able to find him a bed upstairs to make him more comfortable. He asked me if it was selfish to not give his family the “last moments” as he could have stayed home with them and I honestly didn’t know what to say. They were called and on their way. And everyone knew there was a good chance he’d be gone by the time they arrived. He told me he didn’t want to be by himself and for the first time, I think I really saw him. He asked me to stay and to not let him die alone. He said he was scared and that’s when I lost it. I apologized for crying and he said his dying wish was for a blowjob. Hahaha. He really knew how to use humor till the end. But even through his crude humor, I knew he was being honest in asking me to stay. 
So I did. I held his hand and told him about all the plans I had for 2019, after I get the all-okay from my doctors. All the traveling I want to do, the places I want to see, the food I want to eat, and air I want to feel. And he said “You deserve it. Where ever you go, take me with you.” 
At some point he kind of stopped responding. The machines didn’t make a huge fuss but the nurses came over and I knew. Luckily the staff didn’t kick me out because I wasn’t family, they allowed me to sit with him till his family got there. I didn’t know I’d be so emotional... this person, someone that was a stranger less than a year ago, had become a dear friend because we connected over this sick disease and I just watched him die. His death wasn’t about me but I couldn’t help but think “cancer you bitch, you could take me too....” and I was both heartbroken and grateful for his death and my life. 

As his family arrived, I gave them their space. His mom knew who I was and just gave me a big hug. She said “All he did was talk about how his new friend, he made his last few months, were some of the greatest months. And more importantly, thank you not letting him go alone. For staying by his side. Thank you for giving that gift to my son.” I had no idea I had any impact on one’s life like that... his whole family kept thanking me for staying with him till the end. 

I literally went to the ER because I was in pain but call it fate, destiny, kismet, the stars aligning or whatever... but I was meant to be there for more and something bigger than myself. To show up for my friend Charleston Chew. 

May you RIP dear friend. Maybe in another timeline I’m giving you that blowjob you dearly wanted. Haha. 
Thanks for everything. Rest easy.",2018-12-27 13:49:11

"A small personal guide on how I deal with terminal cancer, if it can help anyone at all even a bit",381,aaabgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/aaabgx/a_small_personal_guide_on_how_i_deal_with/,54,1546032611.0,"I'm 30 and going to die soon. I've had a year to come to terms with it. Here is how I rationalize it if it can be of help to anyone.

I was lucky to have so much time to think this over, time really does help to accept the inevitable. We all know it's coming someday. It just comes sooner for some. People say I'm pretty zen considering the circumstances and I'd say it is an accurate assessment. I certainly wouldn't be this zen if I had just learned I had cancer AND a few weeks to live at the same time. I knew every step of the way my chances were very slim and my oncologists were very honest about it.

I'm not saying it's a walk in the park either, I have serious pain issues, I'm heavily medicated and I try to beat into submission that stupid feeling of guilt for making people who love me feel sad. No, it's not your fault you have cancer, but you feel like the bearer of bad news all the time and that can take its toll. I usually just tell my SO my brain is trying to make me feel guilty today and she makes it go away with a kind word and a hug. Which brings me to making a small list of what helps me deal with the situation. This is the internet after all and we like lists!

* **I surround myself with people who make me feel good.** Not all of your friends and loved ones will react well to your situation and that's ok, we all have our strength and weaknesses. Identify those who make you feel good when you hang out with them instead of those who will leech your energy without even meaning to. Let them deal with their emotions, they got plenty more time and energy to spend than you.

* **I feel blessed every day that I have the time to say goodbye instead of leaving everyone suddenly by surprise.** I'm a young adult, statistically, I should die of a suicide or a sudden car crash, not of cancer. I feel so blessed that I have the time to plan my funeral, to write letters to loved ones, to say the things that matter and offer loved ones that opportunity as well. I think this is much preferable to the alternative, but I've met others with terminal cancer who say they would have prefered to die instantly by surprise so maybe I'm the exception.

* **I've already been dead for a few billion years, and it wasn't too bad.** As you can guess from this I don't believe in an afterlife at all. For me dying is a return to the state I was in before my birth. The year 1900 isn't very scary to me even if I did not exist. The year 2020 isn't very scary to me for the same reasons. Non-existence is my standard state except for that small blimp of life I will have been blessed to experience over the universe's lifespan. Maybe this is a scary concept to some but it brings me comfort.

* **I accept I have absolutely no control over the progress of my illness.** I know some people have a need for the illusion of control, but the truth is that apart from eating well, sleeping sufficiently, doing you chemo/treatment, getting a bit of exercise even if it's just walking and making the effort to have a social life, all of these when possible, then you're already doing everything you can. Give yourself a pat on the back and try to accept that things will happen whether you like it or not, so try to enjoy the ride even if you're not the one driving.

* **I have little time, it is precious, but I must accept my energy is limited and I have the right to rest without feeling guilty.** I can't let the feeling that I'm somehow wasting time if I Netflix and chill take over. I have little time, yes, but I have a right to use some of that time to relax without feeling guilty. My body and mind need rest and I need a sense of normality.

* **I give myself small goals and projects.** If I just wait passively for death, then I feel like it's wasted time. Even if I probably just have a few weeks at most, then I'll find a small project to accomplish during that time that I can realistically accomplish and be proud of. In my case, it's writing one goodbye letter to every person I love and making a video montage for my funeral. For me, productive time is a happy time, especially knowing it will bring joy to loved ones.

* **I've lived making sure I'd regret nothing and I'm surrounded by loved ones.** Now, this part is the one that helps me the most but It can be too late for the first part and you may have no control over the loved ones part. I'm lucky that my grandfather told me on his deathbed when I was 16 that when I'd be dying I wouldn't regret my mistakes but instead the things I never tried but would have wanted to accomplish. I took that advice to heart and applied it every day of my life. Maybe it's too late for you to apply that advice, but it makes my incoming death a hell of a lot easier knowing I have no regrets and wouldn't change a thing in my life apart from cancer. I also understand you don't control if you have a good family and you may not have had the chance to develop good friendships, and I'm sorry if that's the case. There are support groups out there that may help you but I imagine it must be a poor substitute. Having no regrets and being surrounded by loved ones is simply what helps me the most through this.


There, I think that covers it. I wish you all the best and if a single element in this list has helped someone out there then I consider this post was worth it. Good luck everyone!",2018-12-28 21:30:11

I'm sitting by my wife right now and she is in and out of consciousness, with her awake times being full of confusion. She has stage 4 Cervical cancer, which started in her cervix last year, but was too large when we caught it to do surgery. After a successful radiation therapy treatment she was declared cured in November 2019.

May 2020 we found it had metastasized to her liver, and after 4 months of chemo that didn't work, and one round of immunotherapy that failed, we are now here. There are no eligible clinical trials, no other treatments. Her life, hopes and dreams, everything we said we'd do but never did, it's all over.

I can't say goodbye. Two weeks ago we were going for a night drive and complaining about the world, politics, breakfast burritos with fish. She was in pain but full of smiles and life. Now she isn't able to comprehend fully what is happening. She can't tell me it's OK. She can respond sometimes but she doesn't really connect to anything happening. I know this is probably for the best for her, but it rips me apart that I don't have a chance to discuss anything that's happening to us.

I am just as shocked and upset as everyone else is, given how young he was and the fact that no one knew he was sick. An untimely death from cancer is a very real and present fear for many of us who post here. My heart goes out to his family and loved ones.

I do want to remind the readers and newcomers here that this sub is a support sub for cancer patients, caregivers, and family. We are not able to diagnose anyone. We are all going through, or have been through, significant hardship. Please remember the rules of this forum, and please refrain from posting just regarding news of his death, questions about colon cancer, and asking if you could have cancer, having learned of his death.

Here are a couple of resources you can look at if you are concerned about colon cancer, any cancer, or want to know more. These resources are way more extensive and accurate than what the posters here can offer. Thanks for reading.

I used to read the sub everyday and write frequently. Now I just can't seem to have any words left in me.

My wife (/u/eternalthesiswriter) passed away on August 15th. She didn't use reddit much, but when she was diagnosed I told her about this place and she came here for advice. Everyone was very kind and gave us great tips that helped us through the beginning of her journey with cancer. Later on, I became an active member of the sub. Being here and sharing the experience with all of you helped me, helped us, so much. You showed me the power of community. I asked for help; I vented and freely expressed my frustrations and fears; I shared the good, the bad, and the ugly. I was never judged, my pain was never undermined, I received the support I was looking for and so desperately needed. I am so thankful to all of you.

My wife's last months were very difficult. She was in and out of the hospital since February until she died, she developed chronic pain and then opioid dependency, she was very depressed and exhausted. I watched her slip away day by day and I don't think I'll ever completely heal from that. We suffered so much through it. However, her last few days were beautiful. She had the chance to decide to stop all treatments that were not intended to give her comfort. She was able to decide when and where to die. I don't how I did it, but I hosted a horde of people at the hospital, sat with them in the waiting room and explained what was happening, gave them gentle instructions so she would still be comfortable around people while being so vulnerable, comforted them outside her room after they said goodbye to her, kept the spirits up by reminding everyone she lived a full life, was truly and fully loved, and was dying surrounded by me, her friends, and her family. I did it for her. I did it because I knew she needed to see all the people she had loved throughout her life. But it was hard and we didn't have much time together. I don't regret it, but still it hurts. She was at peace and happy at the end. She left with a smile on her face and that was a great gift. I knew then and there I had done a good job despite the circumstances. 

Yes, she died, but we had such a great time together and she was so loved. Not only when she was healthy, but also when she was living with cancer and then dying of cancer. I gave up my whole life to be her partner, her caretaker, and her unconditional 24/7 support through the disease, and I'm so, so, so glad I did it. I quit my job, I spent my savings, I lost many of my friends. There has been nothing else and there will be nothing else more important than those nineteenth months we spent together. I appreciate and cherish every second of the journey, even the horrible, traumatizing, painful parts of it because I had the honor to be with her and love through it.

She's gone and I'm slowly trying to rebuild my life. Doing this without her hurts all the time. I miss her so much. I have a lot of support: my friends and her friends have showered me with compassion, patience, understanding, practical help, and possibly too much food. Yet, I don't know how I'll make it without her, but I'm trying. I promised her I would be ok, so I'm trying. I hope she knows I'm trying. I hope wherever she is she has forgiven me for my mistakes and shortcomings. I hope wherever she is she knows I love her, I will always love her, I have always loved her. 

Thank you everybody for being there for us. I will be forever grateful to all of you. I admire you and respect you all so much. We are stronger than anyone else can imagine. Thank you for making the decision to live and love everyday in face of this disease. In the end, whatever happens, whether you or your loved one gets cured or dies, that's what really matters: the love you give yourself and the love you give others.",2019-08-25 22:16:16

I saw it someplace else and just had to share. I’ve never seen it here so hopefully not a repost.  Great read. 



What it's like to go thru cancer and treatment 
 

What’s it like to go through cancer treatment? 
It’s something like this: One day, you’re minding your own business, you open the fridge to get some breakfast, and OH MY GOD THERE’S A MOUNTAIN LION IN YOUR FRIDGE.
Wait, what? How? Why is there a mountain lion in your fridge? NO TIME TO EXPLAIN. RUN! THE MOUNTAIN LION WILL KILL YOU! UNLESS YOU FIND SOMETHING EVEN MORE FEROCIOUS TO KILL IT FIRST!

So you take off running, and the mountain lion is right behind you. You know the only thing that can kill a mountain lion is a bear, and the only bear is on top of the mountain, so you better find that bear. You start running up the mountain in hopes of finding the bear. Your friends desperately want to help, but they are powerless against mountain lions, as mountain lions are godless killing machines. But they really want to help, so they’re cheering you on and bringing you paper cups of water and orange slices as you run up the mountain and yelling at the mountain lion - “GET LOST, MOUNTAIN LION, NO ONE LIKES YOU” - and you really appreciate the support, but the mountain lion is still coming.

Also, for some reason, there’s someone in the crowd who’s yelling “that’s not really a mountain lion, it’s a puma” and another person yelling “I read that mountain lions are allergic to kale, have you tried rubbing kale on it?”

As you’re running up the mountain, you see other people fleeing their own mountain lions. Some of the mountain lions seem comparatively wimpy - they’re half grown and only have three legs or whatever, and you think to yourself - why couldn’t I have gotten one of those mountain lions? But then you look over at the people who are fleeing mountain lions the size of a monster truck with huge prehistoric saber fangs, and you feel like an asshole for even thinking that - and besides, who in their right mind would want to fight a mountain lion, even a three-legged one?

Finally, the person closest to you, whose job it is to take care of you - maybe a parent or sibling or best friend or, in my case, my husband - comes barging out of the woods and jumps on the mountain lion, whaling on it and screaming “GODDAMMIT MOUNTAIN LION, STOP TRYING TO EAT MY WIFE,” and the mountain lion punches your husband right in the face. Now your husband (or whoever) is rolling around on the ground clutching his nose, and he’s bought you some time, but you still need to get to the top of the mountain.

Eventually you reach the top, finally, and the bear is there. Waiting. For both of you. You rush right up to the bear, and the bear rushes the mountain lion, but the bear has to go through you to get to the mountain lion, and in doing so, the bear TOTALLY KICKS YOUR ASS, but not before it *also* punches your husband in the face. And your husband is now staggering around with a black eye and bloody nose, and saying, “Can I get some help, I’ve been punched in the face by two apex predators and I think my nose is broken,” and all you can say is “I’M KIND OF BUSY IN CASE YOU HADN’T NOTICED I’M FIGHTING A MOUNTAIN LION.”

Then, IF YOU ARE LUCKY, the bear leaps on the mountain lion and they are locked in epic battle until finally the two of them roll off a cliff edge together, and the mountain lion is dead. 
Maybe. You’re not sure - it fell off the cliff, but mountain lions are crafty. It could come back at any moment.

And all your friends come running up to you and say, “That was amazing! You’re so brave, we’re so proud of you! You didn’t die! That must be a huge relief!” 

Meanwhile, you blew out both your knees, you’re having an asthma attack, you twisted your ankle, and also you have been mauled by a bear. And everyone says “Boy, you must be excited to walk down the mountain!” And all you can think as you stagger to your feet is “Fuck this mountain, I never wanted to climb it in the first place.😳”

Initially her surgeons were only planning to sample enough abnormal tissue to get a diagnosis. When they got in there, i guess the tumour was more easily distinguishable than they thought, so they were able to remove everything that looked abnormal in her brain. Her post-op MRI didn’t show any remaining tumour either which is fantastic. We aren’t out of the woods by any means but this is the best possible outcome we could have had so far. 

Our next big hurdle is the pathology results. If it comes back as a high grade tumour like ATRT (which is likely) we will need to begin chemo as soon as possible to kill any remaining cells. 

Aside from all that she is doing amazing. she woke up within an hour from surgery and was talking to us, and she may be able to leave PICU and go to the regular ward today! It’s only been 24 hours so I’m surprised. She hasn’t complained not once, and she’s only on a very small dose of morphine. 

She blows me away with her strength and resilience. I never expected that my 4 year old would be able to breeze through brain surgery like it was no biggie. She is such a little fighter. 
Thank you everyone for your support on my last post. It’s great to have this community to check in with.

The best news of my life: Mom’s stage IV lung cancer has gone into complete remission.,253,f6ira6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/f6ira6/the_best_news_of_my_life_moms_stage_iv_lung/,76,1582180617.0,"Hey guys, 

I promised to keep you updated, so I really want to share that moment with you. About 5 weeks ago my mom had her first control PET scan after four cycles of chemotherapy and Keytruda, two Keytruda-only infusions, a metastectomy of the spine and IMRT of the spine. Her PET scan showed that all her metastatic sites had disappeared, all her lymph nodes had cleared up and her tumor had shrunk from 88x64 to 19x11mm. 

Her doctors decided to ablate the original tumor with SBRT so we returned to the hospital this Monday. The radiation oncologist did a CT scan and then some respiratory simulation. 

Today...my phone starts ringing in the morning, I see an unknown number. I pick up: “Hello, this is Dr.X, your mother’s radiation oncologist.” 

At this point my heart skips probably half a minute worth of regular beats. Her doctors have never called us before, so I fear bad news (more extensive disease than anticipated so no SBRT).

Next, Dr.X continues: “I cannot do SBRT because your mom’s cancer has disappeared entirely. My colleagues and I have been looking at the PET-CT scan and yesterday’s CT images and we literally cannot see a single dot of what was there 5 weeks ago. Congratulations, your mom has responded completely to Keytruda monotherapy and her cancer has fled her lung faster than we could manage to ablate it.” I probably say: “Are you sure?”, “Thank you”, “Amazing” and “How’s that possible” more times than I can count.

I am not even sure what’s going on right now. It seems absolutely surreal that in 4-5 short months my mom has gone from 6 painkillers a day, facing one of the deadliest cancers, to...my old mom, pain-free, happy, full of life, eager to return to work, take care of our home and her favorite dog, and travel.

Her doctors seem equally...pleasantly surprised. As I have mentioned before, mom’s PDL1 negative, so the odds of her responding to Keytruda were quite slim to begin with. A complete response...I was afraid to even dream of that.

She will stay on Keytruda for another 18 months. 

Thank you guys so much for the incredible support all throughout that uphill battle. I will stick around r/cancer for as long as I can help anyone out. ❤️",2020-02-20 06:36:57

She got onto the couch, felt short of breath, and asked my dad to rub her back to calm her down.

She then closed her eyes, leaned against him to rest, and passed. She died in the comfort of her own home, not hooked up to machines in hospice. She was beside the man who was the love of her life, her caretaker, and just went to sleep. She didn't suffer.

She doesn't have to suffer.

She lost mobility in her legs so she couldn't even use the bathroom alone. She absolutely hated it, having to wear adult diapers and not having any independence.

My mom is finally free from this disgusting, awful disease. I miss her so fucking much, of course. She was my best friend, after all.

But.. she's finally free from the medication and the needles and the captivity that NSCLC held her in.

She has her beautiful, long, brown hair back. She can sing with a full voice, her throat not aching. She can walk again.

I loved her until the end, and I still love her. My last words were, ""Love you, see you later.""

Also, for some reason, there’s someone in the crowd who’s yelling “that’s not really a mountain lion, it’s a puma” and another person yelling “I read that mountain lions are allergic to kale, have you tried rubbing kale on it?”

As you’re running up the mountain, you see other people fleeing their own mountain lions. Some of the mountain lions seem comparatively wimpy - they’re half grown and only have three legs or whatever, and you think to yourself - why couldn’t I have gotten one of those mountain lions? But then you look over at the people who are fleeing mountain lions the size of a monster truck with huge prehistoric saber fangs, and you feel like an asshole for even thinking that - and besides, who in their right mind would want to fight a mountain lion, even a three-legged one?

Finally, the person closest to you, whose job it is to take care of you - maybe a parent or sibling or best friend or, in my case, my husband - comes barging out of the woods and jumps on the mountain lion, whaling on it and screaming “GODDAMMIT MOUNTAIN LION, STOP TRYING TO EAT MY WIFE,” and the mountain lion punches your husband right in the face. Now your husband (or whatever) is rolling around on the ground clutching his nose, and he’s bought you some time, but you still need to get to the top of the mountain.

Eventually you reach the top, finally, and the bear is there. Waiting. For both of you. You rush right up to the bear, and the bear rushes the mountain lion, but the bear has to go through you to get to the mountain lion, and in doing so, the bear TOTALLY KICKS YOUR ASS, but not before it also punches your husband in the face. And your husband is now staggering around with a black eye and bloody nose, and saying “can I get some help, I’ve been punched in the face by two apex predators and I think my nose is broken,” and all you can say is “I’M KIND OF BUSY IN CASE YOU HADN’T NOTICED I’M FIGHTING A MOUNTAIN LION.”

Then, IF YOU ARE LUCKY, the bear leaps on the mountain lion and they are locked in epic battle until finally the two of them roll off a cliff edge together, and the mountain lion is dead.

Maybe. You’re not sure - it fell off the cliff, but mountain lions are crafty. It could come back at any moment.

And all your friends come running up to you and say “that was amazing! You’re so brave, we’re so proud of you! You didn’t die! That must be a huge relief!”
Meanwhile, you blew out both your knees, you’re having an asthma attack, you twisted your ankle, and also you have been mauled by a bear. And everyone says “boy, you must be excited to walk down the mountain!” And all you can think as you stagger to your feet is “fuck this mountain, I never wanted to climb it in the first place.”

I’m been told my cancer isn’t curable and I’m lost,229,fqtfrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/fqtfrf/im_been_told_my_cancer_isnt_curable_and_im_lost/,52,1585461154.0,"So... this week I was told that my cancer isn’t curable. I was diagnosed in September 2019 with liver metastasis while roughly 7 months pregnant. I was told it don’t look good, but there was hope.

After a lot of meetings they decided to do a C-section, so my beautiful little girl arrived about 7 weeks too early. Healthy and strong. I was put on chemo until December when they decided it had shrunk enough and in January I underwent a massive surgery, removing about 70% of my liver. 

Sadly that didn’t seem to be enough. Markers in my blood were back this month, and after a PET scan they now know that it’s spread to my bones... spine and hips at least, and I don’t have a lot of time left. My oncologist estimated 1-2 years. I got the news this week. And I feel so horribly lost. I look at my little girl, now almost 6 months old and I... hurt, I ache, I want to be there for her... I want to see her grow up and turn into the beautiful strong woman I know she’ll be. I feel so cheated, I was starting the best part of my life and now I’ve been told that it’s ending...

Now I’m in no way giving up, I’m back on chemo and I’m going to fight this with everything I have, I’m going to look for every clinical trial and experimental treatment, but sometimes I honestly don’t know what to do with myself. I’m 31 and all I want with every fibre of my being is to be there for my girl and partner.

So if anyone has any tips, advice, treatments to recommend... anything. I just want to feel a little less lost.

Edit: So lost I can’t even type anymore it seems, that’s what you get for crying and typing. Thanks for all the love and motivation so far though. ❤️",2020-03-29 05:52:34

Actually fuck that, don't just tell me about him, give me his number so we can run a race together when I can run again. 

I realize that it's incredibly hard to find the right thing to say when you're on the outside but people need to realize that sometimes saying nothing is better than opening your mouth just for the sake of speaking. Give me a hug. Tell me you love me and that you're sorry I'm going through this.

I see so many posts from caretakers asking how they can better support their partners, or grateful posts from people thanking their spouses, kids, partners, SOs, etc. 

I see posts talking about how hard Covid has been because their partners can't come with them to appointments or treatments, can't be with them in surgery. But that's been the reality for single people long before Covid. We were already doing that. It's hard but it's possible.

I went through cancer while single (I'm still navigating it months after active treatment). Its been hard. I relied on my parents (who live in another city) and friends (but it's not the same when you're living alone). Recovering from surgery in an empty apartment, not having someone to hug you when the side effects are too much, no one to calm you down the first day you wake up with hair all over your pillow, no one to help take care of surgical wounds, no one to rub your back when your throwing up at 2am. 

It's. So. Hard. 

But you know what? I see fewer complaints from the people doing it on their own than I do from people with partners. You know that you have to do this because you don't have someone to pick up the slack. 

I'm a few months out of treatment now. I went through 4 surgeries and chemotherapy on my own. I went to appointments alone, took notes so I wouldn't forget things, tracked my meds, recovered alone. I know so many of you out there are doing the same, and doing it with very few complaints, because you are your own support system.

If anyone is currently going through treatment on their own and they need someone to talk to, don't be afraid to reach out. You've got this. **You're so strong.**",2020-08-18 00:33:55

My oncologist admits that she didn't think it was likely either, but she resolved to be as aggressive as possible.

I was put on targeted pills for my specific mutation (ALK) and also had whole brain radiation, lung surgery, gamma knife surgery, and chest radiation. Now I have NED and will be on the pills until they stop working. 

At the start of this, I was so desperate to find success stories. I know that I have been unbelievably lucky so far, and I also know that this is not over and I will not have the long life I used to think I would have. The decades to fill. But I have right now, and I hope my story can give someone at least a little hope.

Bye (?),213,8diciq,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/8diciq/bye/,39,1524202313.0,"I met with my oncologist today. Things are not looking good. I was pulled off an oral chemo two months ago due to blood clots. Now the oncologist is hesitant to put me on another chemo because my blood counts are low and my body weight continues to be low. I have tried over several months to put on weight but it is just not working. High protein and calorie drinks, icecreams, pbj sandwiches, mashed potatoes - name it, I have tried them.

Add to that, my daily terrible stomach pains, nausea, bloating and all other issues makes it extremely difficult for me to eat or drink like a normal person. I guess its just the nature of the disease or cachexia.

So after having gone through the standard cancer treatments - chemo, radiation, surgery, chemo...my options are at a dead end. The oncologist said that without treatment I could last perhaps a few weeks, months to a year - he cannot really say. And even if I were to get chemo, it won't help me much, maybe add a little more time to the inevitable.

So, I guess thats it. I lost my wife to another non-related cancer a few years ago. She was 38. And now I am facing death before reaching 50. My son who is majoring in Biology because he wants to be a doctor (A determined decision made by him after his mom's death) will unfortunately become an orphan.

CANCER FREE!!,205,g2qrpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/g2qrpw/cancer_free/,17,1587110029.0,"Last year I was diagnosed with an aggressive type of Lymphoma at the age of 17. I wouldn’t be able to go to school to attend my senior year and and was heartbroken to be isolated from my friends. 

Over the course of about 5 months of intensive chemotherapy my hair fell out and I felt worse. After 3 rounds of chemo I was forced to undergo another biopsy as the doctors feared I was not responding to treatment. During this biopsy I found out that there was a high possibility of me losing one or both of my testicles. Luckily I didn’t have to increase the intensity of my treatment and I was able to finish out the rest of my chemo by March this year. 

My goal throughout treatment was to be in remission and able to spend my 18th birthday with friends without worrying about any side effects and symptoms of treatment. Unfortunately that didn’t work out but I will still celebrate after COVID quarantine is over. A few days ago I was told I was in remission and did not need any more chemo. This has been the most exciting part of my year so far. Unfortunately with COVID I won’t be able to go back to school for a few months like I wanted and my graduation has been cancelled. 

I’m truly thankful for my support system who helped me feel loved while I fought cancer. In particular one of my friends who would come over after school whenever I needed company and who helped me partake in new hobbies such as gardening, building computers and remodeling my room. I also relied on the support of one of my teachers who made sure to check on me often by texting my mother and I. He too is a cancer survivor and worked his hardest to get other teachers to be more understanding of my situation and my capacity to do work. I also really appreciated this sub during my treatment.

I am very grateful to my supportive family & friends. If not for them, I would be suffering more. I am also indebted to the medical team for their support. 

I hope everyone here who has cancer will also hear the beautiful words, ""you no longer have cancer.""

What's the best news you have heard so far?",2020-07-13 16:40:21
My tumor shrunk again!,194,99xvu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/99xvu7/my_tumor_shrunk_again/,37,1535149855.0,"Yesterday was my 4th MRI since my Glioblastoma diagnosis in November.

My first and second scans showed it was stable, which is pretty good news for this type of cancer.

My third scan, showed a moderate reduction in size.  And my scan yesterday showed it was half the size it was 2 months ago!

Considering we were initially hoping to ""slow down it's growth"", the fact that mine is shrinking is huge news.

Male cancer nurse here,196,jkk09e,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/jkk09e/male_cancer_nurse_here/,36,1604038221.0,"I have a patient. 30M with Metastatic Rhabdomyosarcoma. Kind, stoic guy. Only a few years older than myself. I wonder if I could be that stoic?

Up the corridor, I check on an old patient who has just been readmitted. I heard that she has a poor prognosis. Her face tells me all I need to know. We chat and laugh a bit, but I can see her hope fading.

A friend sees me, and we catch up. She tells me that a patient who recently went into remission and went to rehab has died, due to a complication. 

All of this hurts and takes an emotional toil on us. To see all of your fights. Your wins, and your losses. I guess that makes oncology (cancer) nurses suckers for punishment -- because we love our job! I say all of this, because I want you all to know, that you're not alone.

What's it like to have cancer......,190,dpdrq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/dpdrq7/whats_it_like_to_have_cancer/,64,1572502157.0,"I didn't write this but it sums things up perfectly.

What’s it like to go through cancer treatment? It’s something like this: one day, you’re minding your own business, you open the fridge to get some breakfast, and OH MY GOD THERE’S A MOUNTAIN LION IN YOUR FRIDGE.

Wait, what? How? Why is there a mountain lion in your fridge? NO TIME TO EXPLAIN. RUN! THE MOUNTAIN LION WILL KILL YOU! UNLESS YOU FIND SOMETHING EVEN MORE FEROCIOUS TO KILL IT FIRST!

So you take off running, and the mountain lion is right behind you. You know the only thing that can kill a mountain lion is a bear, and the only bear is on top of the mountain, so you better find that bear. You start running up the mountain in hopes of finding the bear. Your friends desperately want to help, but they are powerless against mountain lions, as mountain lions are godless killing machines. But they really want to help, so they’re cheering you on and bringing you paper cups of water and orange slices as you run up the mountain and yelling at the mountain lion - “GET LOST, MOUNTAIN LION, NO ONE LIKES YOU” - and you really appreciate the support, but the mountain lion is still coming.

Also, for some reason, there’s someone in the crowd who’s yelling “that’s not really a mountain lion, it’s a puma” and another person yelling “I read that mountain lions are allergic to kale, have you tried rubbing kale on it?”

As you’re running up the mountain, you see other people fleeing their own mountain lions. Some of the mountain lions seem comparatively wimpy - they’re half grown and only have three legs or whatever, and you think to yourself - why couldn’t I have gotten one of those mountain lions? But then you look over at the people who are fleeing mountain lions the size of a monster truck with huge prehistoric saber fangs, and you feel like an asshole for even thinking that - and besides, who in their right mind would want to fight a mountain lion, even a three-legged one?

Finally, the person closest to you, whose job it is to take care of you - maybe a parent or sibling or best friend or, in my case, my husband - comes barging out of the woods and jumps on the mountain lion, whaling on it and screaming “GODDAMMIT MOUNTAIN LION, STOP TRYING TO EAT MY WIFE,” and the mountain lion punches your husband right in the face. Now your husband (or whatever) is rolling around on the ground clutching his nose, and he’s bought you some time, but you still need to get to the top of the mountain.

Eventually you reach the top, finally, and the bear is there. Waiting. For both of you. You rush right up to the bear, and the bear rushes the mountain lion, but the bear has to go through you to get to the mountain lion, and in doing so, the bear TOTALLY KICKS YOUR ASS, but not before it also punches your husband in the face. And your husband is now staggering around with a black eye and bloody nose, and saying “can I get some help, I’ve been punched in the face by two apex predators and I think my nose is broken,” and all you can say is “I’M KIND OF BUSY IN CASE YOU HADN’T NOTICED I’M FIGHTING A MOUNTAIN LION.”

Then, IF YOU ARE LUCKY, the bear leaps on the mountain lion and they are locked in epic battle until finally the two of them roll off a cliff edge together, and the mountain lion is dead.

Maybe. You’re not sure - it fell off the cliff, but mountain lions are crafty. It could come back at any moment.

And all your friends come running up to you and say “that was amazing! You’re so brave, we’re so proud of you! You didn’t die! That must be a huge relief!”
Meanwhile, you blew out both your knees, you’re having an asthma attack, you twisted your ankle, and also you have been mauled by a bear. And everyone says “boy, you must be excited to walk down the mountain!” And all you can think as you stagger to your feet is “fuck this mountain, I never wanted to climb it in the first place.”

After finishing treatment, I found a new purpose in my life. I went to nursing school with the hopes of someday accepting a job on a heme/onc unit.

But, I was able to get a new job that changed my career path, which effectively tripled my salary. I met a lovely girl and we’ve been together for over a year now.

She was a fighter,183,9w1wof,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/9w1wof/she_was_a_fighter/,39,1541949035.0,"At 5am my world was violently ripped asunder. 

We met in college when we were 19 through a mutual friend and it was love at first sight. I asked her if she wanted to go out sometime and we decided to go to a Mexican restaurant that quickly became one of our favorites. We sat and ate and talked to one another about nothing at all, just enjoying each other's company. After we ate a went to the movies to see jumper. She was staying in a dor. At the time so I took her back to campus, but I didn't want to leave her, I wanted to spend every waking moment with this bright loving beacon, we went and sat on north campus and watched drunk people stumble around until almost 4 in the morning, it was fantastic. 

2 weeks later we walked around campus and found a nice garden, she told me she loved me. I knew I was going to spend my life with her. We did everything together, I loved everything about her. Just being near her or hearing her voice was intoxicating to me.

 I knew I was going to marry her. I shouldn't have waited so long, it took me five years to ask her to be my wife, even though I knew from the second I laid eyes on her. I asked her to marry me during a photo shoot at the botanical gardens, I cherish the pictures I have of that day. 

We were engaged for 2 years before we got married. On March 7th 2015 I got to marry the love of my life, it was outdoors and the weather was perfect. God she was beautiful. We went to Asheville on our honeymoon. 

In January of 2016 she was having pain that we thought were ulcers, they were not. After a series of scans and biopsy results we got the news we feared. On March 7th 2016, our one year anniversary, we were supposed to get results back, we were told to come into the office the next day. It hung over our day like an ominous cloud.
The next day at her appointment we learned that she had colorectal cancer that had spread into her liver. I will never forget us sitting in the office as she wept repeating ""it's not fair, I don't want to die."" Our world and future plans were derailed. 

Over the next year it was chemo every other week. The day after our 2 year anniversary she went in for surgery. Over 6 hours they removed half of her liver, but were not able to remove the part in her colon because she was on the table for so long. She was strong through it all. Always fighting and keeping a good outlook. When I would let my mind wander to dark places she told me that it was ok and she wasnt giving up. 

Things were going ok after that, scans were looking better and no new growth was showing. We started making plans for our future again. Somehow all the chemos didn't take away her fertility, we wanted a family but we wanted a year of clean scans first. 

This year our 3rd wedding anniversary came with fear, as the last 2 had. Things seemed to be going well. A few days after she was having pains again so we went for more scans. They showed the main tumor was back and had spread to her lungs and lymph nodes, still she wanted to fight it. 

In  August we saw that the cancer wasnt responding to treatment. Instead of giving up she asked what else we could do. We were referred to a clinical trial that was 6 hours away from where we live. She stared the trial 3 weeks ago, it seems like a lifetime ago. 

2 weeks ago she was having hearing and vision trouble, we contacted the clinical trial and they said that could be related to the trial and to just let them know if anything changes. She was angry and irritated with everything, we fought I yelled at her because she wanted to give up, for the first time in 10 years i was angry with her. After all we had been through I didn't want it to end like that. I still hate myself for it, even though we talked about it after. 

Monday we were going to go to the dr to get her fluids because she wasnt eating much. She was having bad chest pains so we called an ambulance. When we got to the hospital they did a scan and saw she had 2-3 liters of fluid in her lungs that were pushing on her heart. They put in a chest tube to drain the fluid. That was when we got the awful news, the cancer had spread to her brain. It was blocking the ventricle and she had swelling and fluid in her skull. They put in a brain shunt and we were waiting to get a plurex catheter for her lungs so we could go home. We spent 9 days in the ICU, she new it was almost over but she still wanted to do every option possible to fight. We went to the oncology floor the next day, that's when she started to decline. They weren't going to do radiation on her brain because they said she probably didn't have that long, they said a week at best  still she told us it was ok and that she wasnt giving up. That was the last real talking we got to do with her. Her breathing be ame laboured that night and I signed  a DNR, it was the hardest thing I had ever done, now just 4 days later and I wish that was the hardest part. Friday we were able to get her stable enough to take her home.

She got to be at home and see our cats one last time. It was some of the last things she said and recognized as we put them on the bed with her she called them all by name. Over the next 12 hours she declined. She was on morphine every 2 hours and she even fought it. All of our family and friends were on the way and I think she was trying to hold on to see them. At 5 this morning with her parents and mine all around her she slowed her breathing until she stopped all together. We were holding her hands. When she passed one of our cats, Storm who she loved so much and was so close with her, grabbed her toy and brought it to the foot of the bed for Ash. The cats are walking around lost looking for their mom.

I still don't feel like its real. I'm afraid to go to sleep because that will mean I have to wake up and go to the funeral home. I have some of our friends in the other room staying with me but I just feel so empty and alone. Our last night in the ICU I had fallen asleep against her bed. She woke me up, pulled me close and said it's ok and gave me a kiss and a hug. She told me that this would be her last Christmas so it would need to be a good one. Then she told me the words that felt like my heart was ripped out. She told me to love someone after this. This is not how our story was supposed to end. We are 30 years old and have been together our entire adult life. I haven't gone through anything without her and I don't know how to. Everyone keeps telling me take it one day at a time, but right now I'm struggling to take it one minute at a time. I find myself lost in my head and feel like I'm drowning. If you took the time to read this, thank you. I needed to tell her story, I love her and miss her. My whole heart and body ache. 

This is one of my favorite pictures of us, because technically she never said yes. Her answer to will you marry me was ""I cant breathe""

I love you Ashley, you were my light and inspiration and I hope that I can tell your story and do you proud. See you on the other side monkey butt",2018-11-11 15:10:35

Given less than 6 months today...

I hope this type of post is allowed... I just really need to get these feelings off my chest.

Bit of a backstory, I am 29 and was diagnosed with Stage IV esophageal cancer in October 2019. By the time they found it, it had already spread into my stomach, liver, and several lymph nodes. They told me from the start that it had progressed too far, and was inoperable.

After 5 months of unsuccessful chemo and radiation, I begin what seems to be my last option for treatment, a type of immunotherapy (I can’t recall the specific name at the moment) on Tuesday.

I met with my doctor today and finally asked the hard questions regarding my prognosis. He told me that if this treatment doesn’t work, I likely have less than six months to live, due to the rate at which the cancer is spreading. Especially in my liver.

Even though I have been expecting and preparing myself to receive this type of news, it has completely broken me. I have cried more today than I have my entire life combined. 

I’ve been sad, scared, angry, all on repeat. I mean, I’m only 29... I’ve barely begun my life, and now it’s being taken away. My fiancée and I had plans to get married in October, but now I don’t know if we should continue or cancel. It seems pointless to plan and spend money on a wedding that might not happen.. or even if it does happen, is it worth it for her to almost immediately become a widow? She’s distraught, and there’s nothing I can do or say to make it better.

In a way, the person I used to be actually died back in October. I’ve been a shell of my former self ever since. I’m not religious and don’t believe in an afterlife, so I’m not scared of being dead. But I am scared of the process of dying. Is it going to be painful? Will there be enough time for my friends and family to come and say our final goodbyes? Or will it happen during this pandemic and I’ll be completely alone in a hospital bed?

I don’t want to come across as being selfish, but it’s just not fair. I’ve stayed strong from day one, but I have no idea how to cope with this.

Thanks for reading... Any advice will be extremely appreciated.",2020-04-10 14:46:28

I'm glad I was there for as long as I could but being honest I kind of feel like throwing up. I saw my best friend die. There was a few minutes we sat there with her body before her mom came back inside from a walk, and then she had us go outside and call our neighbor, who is a nurse, over to her house with a stethoscope to check for a pulse. At that point me and my other best friend knew in our hearts that it happened, even before the nurse came back out to tell us that her pulse was no longer there.",2020-05-04 20:48:59

My body didn’t like it. I still had all the abdominal and bowel issues I would have had with IV treatment. And this time around it got it my head.  I got really down, depressed and angry. That was new for me because I’ve never shed a single tear over my situation and I’ve never had a “Woe is me “ moment. Not one time. I’ve always been positive.

If getting rid of cancer was really that easy? No doctor in their sane mind would ever recommend chemotherapy to their patients.

If it wasn't for chemotherapy and radiation, I would have ended up on a ventilator in the ER, if that because I had a tumor growing rapidly in my chest that had displaced my heart and was putting severe pressure on my windpipe (doctors ive worked said theoretically I could have easily died if I waited another month or two to check with my primary care doctor about the symptoms I was going through). If it got any bigger I could have had a stroke, heart attack, or gone hypoxic (not able to get enough oxygen in my body).

Everyone and their mother has opinions about chemotherapy, but when you're sitting their in the doctors office and they tell you face to face ""this is cancer, these are your treatment options"" the reality of how dire the situation is hits you like a cement truck. 

Yes family and friends can comment ""omg I know someone who went through cancer"" but YOU DID NOT ACTUALLY HAVE CANCER.

I created this account for him, hoping to get him interested and that Reddit might help to entertain him during various treatments, etc. He passed away yesterday, emaciated and exhausted from the ridiculous and (in his case) ineffective chemotherapies and immunotherapies. I'll never know for sure but can only wonder if his last six months would have been more pleasant for him had he forgone any treatment. I'm beating myself up with all the what ifs and I just want to die and be with him. I have a kitchen counter full of his leftover pain medicines so it would be so easy to join him. 

Edit: (follow up?)
Thank you all so much. This experience has changed my thinking drastically. I know that, with time, this will get easier.

I'm not a leaner. (51f) I'm a former Marine that is used to being leaned on, not the other way around. I don't know how to do it. Many of you are telling me to ""reach out to friends and family"" but, to me, there's a problem with that advice. No one I know can even fathom this sadness, this devastating loss. I lost my husband, my best friend, my future, and our shared dream. We retired this year and moved to Las Vegas from Raleigh. 8 days into retirement, he had a seizure and we eventually learned that he had advanced renal cell carcinoma that had metastasized everywhere...his poor brain, lungs, bones, lymph nodes...everywhere. 

Sharing details of his treatments with family and friends was hard for me because I rarely had anything good to say. I believed that I was burdening the people that love us the most and that, sometimes, they were only listening because they were obligated. Did they really want to hear how he threw up his Ensure today? They didn't really want to know how, near the end, his little knees were bigger around than his thighs.

But you guys...this Reddit family...every one of you that reached out to me in the last couple of days...you all did it voluntarily. Pure love for a fellow human being in pain. You came to the party because you wanted to, not because you had to and it's an entirely different connection for me. I'm crying right now as I write this. It's overwhelming the difference you've made and how grateful I am for you.

Also, most of you have survived this nightmare I'm living right now. Because of that and even though we've never met and, more than likely, never will, I feel closer to you right now than most ""friends and family"".

I can't make myself throw all the Oxy out just yet BUT I have moved it all to a shoebox in a closet. Also, you (a collective ""you"") made me see what an honor it was to care for such a great man and that he would want me to be strong and, eventually, even stronger.

It might take a week but, once his ashes are ready, I intend to escort some of them back to NC and deliver them to his grieving parents. Two days ago, I had very different plans. Thank you again.

My girlfriend with rectal cancer that spread to her lungs, liver, and cervical area had always planned to utilize the DWD drug if it came to that. She had always bounced back after every chemotheropy and radiation treatments and even two emergency surgeries. So I have always been optimistic about her beating it, but after the last surgery in December she got a staph infection, was put on heavy antibiotics and was unable to do chemo again until three months ago. At that point she became resistant to irinotecan and began to get hives. there was only one oral chemo that was a viable option that did little except make her feel even more shitty. And that point is when the cancer noticeably spread.

Two months ago her oncologist gave her three to six months. She had taken the initial steps for verbal confirmation to utilize the DWD. We went to the emergency room November 12th for Edema (swelling in legs and feet). She was admitted and immediately put on a saline drip to refill her electrolytes and combat it. After four days in the hospital, she gained 11 lbs in her legs from water retention, pain increased tenfold, delirium was setting in, and she was hardly able to stay awake. Her family decided to put her on hospice. The two days before hospice she was lucid when she was awake. She was adamant about taking the DWD drugs. Being on hospice shortened the wait to five days to obtain them.

Yesterday we obtained the DWD drugs. She is not awake or alert enough to give proper consent, or sip a straw so we are using a squirt bottle to give her water. She can’t control her bowels or urination and is on deaths door. 

This is not my girlfriend.
This isn’t the woman I have loved.
This is not what she wanted.

But I am here for her through it all because I want to make sure she is taken care of. She would’ve taken the DWD drugs the week we were in the hospital but we had to fucking wait. This slow death is much, much harder on everyone especially her. 

If you are contemplating it, have it ready. Have it signed. There isn’t time to wait.

I am like all of the cancer warriors here who believe, never give up ! So, I looked for clinical trials, found one being carried out about 2 hour commuting distance from my residence. I met with the doctor. Some tests were carried out and I was rejected as a candidate for the trial.
But the doctor told me that immunotherapy could be tried as an option and asked me to talk to my doctor about it.

I told my doctor and he was completely negative about it. He told me that it has not shown to work for my kind of cancer and even gave me some clinical trial results printout about it.

Myself, a single widowed father of 2 kids has gone through hell in the past 2 years since my sudden diagnosis. In terms of treatments and everyday pain and suffering that most of you may have probably gone/going through too.

Unwilling to give up the fight, I requested for the immunotherapy treatment. He finally agreed, sent necessary paperwork and luckily I was approved to receive the drug (Keytruda).

I received my first infusion this week. My doctor again reminded me that it will most probably not work (In my mind, ""I know, I know. How many times will you repeat it, Sir ? I am still willing to take my chances"").

Hoping and praying it works for me as it has done for a few cases that I have read about. My kids need me. Onward !

I just want people to listen to my story. Me and my wife were dating since 2014, but we were friends before that. We officially got married in 2018 in beautiful Pennsylvania. We had a great marriage. There were no issues between us; whatever discourse we had we always settled on an agreement. She was always happy. What hurt us the most that at the beginning of 2019 in March, she was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer, which was a few days her birthday. That was the worst thing anyone wanted to hear a few days after their birthday. She was very gung-ho about taking chemotherapy and beating this cancer. She was very hopeful that she would beat this cancer and she had the dream of ringing the bell that was at the breast Care center signaling that it was their last chemotherapy to take on that day. she progressively started getting worse around July right after our 1st wedding anniversary. One week ago as of September sure she was admitted into the hospital for a low temperature and low blood pressure and it scared us both. As she was staying here she slowly started to drift out of consciousness. Her oncologist wanted to speak with me and her parents about her condition and we had asked her about her mortality. she was very hesitant at first to tell us because she was explaining what the cancer was doing to her and then she eventually told us at that time a week ago that she had about a few days to a few weeks left to live. this past week has been gut and heart-wrenching for everyone in her life not only just family but friends as well. She was the most purest person I had ever met she never had any malice towards anyone nor did she hate anyone. Anyone she met she always met with a big and kind smile, and now it looks like she only has 1 to 2 days left to live. I've been very strong for her this entire journey and I told myself that the only time I'd be able to cry would be when it is all over. Please I want to hear your kind words of support to keep me going. Thank you.

However, with the positivity of my friends and family, I truly believe that has kept my mindset that I will keep beating this for as long as I can and refuse to be the 70% statistic. Right now I don’t have a time frame anymore. Keep on fighting! ",2018-10-18 05:03:24

We used to work together as bouncers a bit over a decade ago. Forged a friendship out of conflict. Backed each other. Trusted each other. Fought against all odds together.

Smartest guy I ever knew. I went to him for all my tech related conundrums. He taught me calculus while we were drunk because why wouldn't you do maths while you're hammered?

I went with him to his initial consults to give him support. I'm a university trained paramedic, so I have some insight into the medical jargon he's faced with.

He's started staying at my place. We live 120 Km apart but he's home by himself and clearly needs some support. I've got a front room doing nothing so it's his as long as he needs it.

Last Wednesday they confirm it's a carcinoma, not a lymphoma like they were expecting, since the first indication was his enlarged lymph nodes. He's rattled but still physically looking okay.

He comes to stay with me and my other mate. The three of us are as close as brothers. We watch him deteriorate in front of us. No energy. Short of breath the whole time. Eventually he starts to struggle and my other mate has to take him to hospital in the middle of the night.

I didn't even pick it. I knew he was unwell. I encouraged him to go to the doctor. He had no acute signs until well after he got to the ED.

He went into heart failure. I got there about 20 minutes before he died. My other mate was on his way from work. His estranged partner has a long drive ahead and was twenty minutes out.

He told me to tell her he loved her.

He arrested.

I had my blinders on.

Clinically I knew he was dying.

Optimistically I knew he was going to be fine. I stepped out of the room to let the doctors and nurses work. I've run arrest scenes before. I know the last thing you need is an emotional bystander messing it up.

Our other mate had just arrived at the ED. I'd go down and get him. We'd go  up and they'd give me the good news. They'd managed to successfully resuscitate him.

The doctor told me he'd died. It didn't make sense. I was just there and he was alive. He'd spoken to me and he was alive.

When his partner arrived I had to tell her. Longest 20 minute wait I ever had to endure. She arrived hoping for the best. She's a doctor. She knew he'd be fine.

She had her blinders on.

We lost the most intelligent, insightful, analytical crazy arsehole who wound people up because he could. The guy who was smarter than the next three people you could line up, but couldn't be comfortable opening up to anyone.

The man-mountain whom I once saw physically hold back an entire mosh pit, earning him the nickname; Obelix.

The man who refused to wear his glasses and so mistook a 50 foot Jesus backdrop while watching P.O.D as a support band for a gigantic portrait of Jimi Hendricks.

The guy who decided to go for a swim in the local lake at 02:00 prompting a visit from the police, who I was able to convince I was going to get him home safely.

You fuckhead.

I'll always miss you.

The love of my life -- my partner of 10 years -- is gone. Severe, irreparable brain hemorrhage from his cancerous brain tumor. He was doing great on Monday. 

He was full of life, joking around, totally mobile, going up and down the stairs. In the middle of the night he got up to pee, said he had a serious headache and collapsed. That was the last time I really saw my Andrew. 

He was on a ventilator for less than a day before his nuerosurgeon told us he would be in a vegetative state in less than 24 hours. I've had many conversations where he begged me not to let that happen to him, so me and his family knew what we had to do. We had to let him go. 

Dealing with all of this amidst COVID-19 is a special kind of hell. We weren't let into the hospital to see him until an hour before they pulled his ventilator. Once pulled, he struggled to breathe for an hour. He passed the second he arrived in bed at hospice care. 

Less than two days ago he was thriving. Now he's dead. I don't know how to deal with this. Fuck cancer forever for taking the best thing that's ever happened to me.",2020-04-02 00:03:48

I can't even begin to contain my joy right now. This past Thursday, my dad had surgery to remove 3 liver tumors (metastatic colorectal cancer). After a grueling 5 hours of surgery, the surgeon came out to speak to us.

He didn't bring us to a private speaking room, which was my first sign it was good news. He told us there were only 2 tumors, the third one was just a benign cyst. He removed the tumors and used ablation to burn off the affected areas to ensure everything was destroyed. Since the 3rd one turned out to be a cyst, instead of removed 50% of his liver, they only had to remove 5% of his liver!

Recovery has been okay so far, 5 days in the hospital. Now he's home recovering trying to make it back to normalcy. I want to thank Dr. Gellar with UPMC in Pittsburgh. He's such an amazing liver surgeon and I believe he has saved my dad's life. If anyone has any questions or any advice, please feel free.

As of today Sept. 30th, a smidge over 9 months since I was diagnosed with Stage IV Melanoma I was told it was gone....

It doesn't feel real, the past nine months feel like a bad dream.  I honestly feel like every horrible side effect I suffered through, every ache and agonizing pain has made me into a stronger person and that I have been given a second chance to make my life into something better.

As some of you may remember, my mom has been battling metastatic lung cancer (NSCLC - large cell or NOS) since June 2019. She had metastectomy of the spine (6 hour surgery involving titanium planks for stabilization), then IMRT of the spine, then four cycles of immunochemotherapy and now she receives Keytruda only. 

Today, we had the first control PET scan after four cycles of chemo and Keytruda and two Keytruda-only infusions.

ALL her metastatic sites have DISAPPEARED. Her huge spine met (78x54mm) has gone. Her adrenal gland met has gone. Her bone mets have gone. Her mediastinal lymph nodes have cleared. All satellite nodules in the lungs have gone. Her main tumor has shrunk from 88x64mm to 19mm at most. 

Her doctors looked at the PET report today and could not believe their eyes. I cried. Mom cried. They looked confused. We looked flabbergasted. It was just a huge mess of happiness, confusion and sheer “how did this happen” reactions. The results surpassed my wildest dreams. Especially since mom’s PD1 negative so she had a very small chance of responding to immunotherapy.

Next, we’ll do SBRT of the original site and doctors hope to end that saga with that last, final blow. My mom will stay on Keytruda for at least two years in the absence of any adverse event.

Still cannot believe what’s happening. My emotions today have ranged from sheer happiness to shock (like I cannot internalize that information) to fear of that beast returning. How do you deal with all of that? 

Also, thank you for all the relentless support while I scribbled posts while under massive scanxiety. I will keep you updated as we move forward.",2020-01-30 21:13:08

I thought it was kidneystones, so did they, until the ultrasound didn't show any, but x-ray caught part of a mass in my lower left lung. I went in for CT scans and then a PET scan, which came back negative. I had a biopsy on Christmas Eve and another 3 days later because the first had to be stopped due to me not being sedated deeply enough. With the PET scan being negative, my pulmonologist was really not expecting cancer, but today I found out they found neuroendocrine carcinoid tumors with metaplastic bone formation. I have a large spherical mass about 3.8cm diameter in my lower left lung, and other growths in my airway. It is spread to my lymph nodes.

The doctors from the different disciplines are all getting together to have a meeting to discuss the diagnosis/prognosis/treatment. So I don't know exactly what stage it is classified as, but I know it's not good.

So it's a tough NYE, and I'm wondering if I will see another. Probably being overdramatic, but it's definitely in my thoughts. I'm trying to take it all in and enjoy my family and the festivities.

Thanks to my oncologist, to Alectinib, and to my best friend morphine I've made it five to ten times longer than that. I'm also pleased to learn that they're developing new drugs for my condition all the time, so when this one stops working entirely, I can still cling mercilessly to the remnants of my life.

The only advise I can offer is:

Listen to your Dr's!! They actually want to cure you so do as you're told.

Research cannabis oils, expecially Thc,  I can't say if these help remove the cancer but for the quality of life they have given me and the help. With sleep, anxiety, food has been amazing! Use them!

Make getting better your No1 priority!   This is before your husband/wife/children/career /social life absolutely everything.  You need to be relaxing, de stressing and recovering, all of the above will be there when you're better.

Oxandrolone-   this is a product given to patients with aids/cancer or other diseases that cause muscle wastage.  I lost 8 stone during my treatment this product helped massively in holding onto some weight and building myself back up again.

I have posted here a while ago my father’s story and you have been incredibly kind and helpful towards me. I want to thank you for taking the time to write or comment me your thoughts.

My father died on the 10th of September, at 5 a.m. Before this, he was diagnosed on the 24th of August with stage 4 pancreatic cancer and was in and out if hospital until he died. His condition worsened day by day, at the point in which I have been shocked to see what this disease does to the human body. It is horrible to see someone you love weaker and sicker as the days go by. By the start of this week, he was already sleeping most of the time, barely speaking and seemed out of this world. I spent time with him, hold his hand and made him laugh for the last time. I am at peace with the fact that his death was natural and painless. He just sighed and stopped breathing. He also seemed at peace with his condition. 

I am still trying to process what happened. I look around the house and expect to see or hear his voice. A month ago he was alive and healthy (we thought), complaining of no pain or symptoms of what was about to come. I initially thought that he will have at least 3 months still to live, but the cancer was extremely aggressive and took out every resource he had. 

Dad, I don’t really know where you are atm. I love so much and you will be forever in my heart. 

For all of you that have experienced this kind of situation, you have all my love and admiration! I have realized that we feel the same, no matter where we are on this planet or what our beliefs are.

She doesn't do that often, because appointments for me are usually 2-3 times weekly. But she was feeling exceptionally attached today. She sat on my lap this morning. She asked if I would nap with her. She 6, she doesn't even nap anymore. But she wanted time with just me, away from the 5 other kids my mom provides daycare for at our house.

Instead, I read to her. I'm trying to ease her into chapter books. But after one short chapter, I acquiesced to her demand that I read some Bernstein Bears. It hurt to read that long. By the time I was done I was taking long, raspy breaths every few sentences. I read through the pain to my son last night, too, continuing my lifelong ambition to read Harry Potter aloud to my kids. My daughter doesn't like it, but my son(8) and I just started the Goblet of Fire.

My doctor wants me to get a tracheotomy. Permanent this time. But it won't remove all the fingers of cancer gripping my throat. It will just keep me from dying in an ambulance due to this growing airway obstruction. Or, as he says, ""for comfort."" I wonder how much effort reading will be with the tracheotomy.

I've had other doctors tell me I'm dying before. But I never could conceive of it being imminent. There is something about struggling to breathe that makes the whole thing much more concrete than past times. 

I've also had more fight in me before. I've known I could make it through more chemo, more radiation, more surgery. Four and a half years into this and I don't feel so certain. Surgery won't take this out.  Neither will radiation. So... chemo is left and I can safely say I'd rather be dead than back on a platinum based chemotherapy.

I don't want to go home. It used to be the thing I feared the most was my kids not remembering me. Now it's the conversation that is looming, closer than ever. The moment when we sit them down and have to tell them I'm done trying.

I don't want to go home, because maybe that day is today. Maybe tonight I'll sign a DNR and tomorrow I'll tell my oncologist that we are switching to palliative treatments only.

I didn't think this was coming today. Not really. And I have to make my decision before I get home.


(10 miles later)

I stopped again, after the rain cleared. I bought myself chocolate, and I got a shirt for my son, a stuffed animal for my daughter, and a candy bar for my husband. I'm not sure what my goal is here. Is this supposed to ease this news?

A month ago my doctors told me that everything looked clear. No new growth. I wasn't expecting that. I thought (at the time) the news was bad. My husband came with me to that appointment. He called my dad on the way home with the good news.

When we pulled in, my kids came running out to the car. They were screaming, giddy from the news. We went inside and they could just not calm down. Neither could I. We did a dance party in the kitchen and I gave them ice cream before bed.

But tge pain and swelling kept getting worse. And here I am, hoping some candy and trinkets will ease the anxiety for my kids. The memory of that night a month ago makes my dread for tonight so much worse.

(30 miles later)

I'm only 10 minutes from home when I get back in my car.  There is a little place where you can look over the valley of our town. I live on the mountain on the other side. I'm staring over at my mountain, hearing and seeing my familyn still not finding the words to say to my kids. 

 Somebody ate all the chocolate. Maybe if I stall long enough they'll be in bed.

Anyway, I should get back in the car. Thanks to anyone who listened to my stream of consciousness thus far.

(Home)

I flicked off my lights as I pulled in the driveway. I'm hoping nobody notices I'm sitting out here. As soon as I slam shut the door of the car, this isn't my private pain anymore. It belongs to those I love the most, too.

I've tried before to lie, to not let them know when it is serious. I never make it long. 

I wanted to make a decision about what direction to go before I got home.  I haven't. Here is what I have decided: to go on a walk with my husband. To take my kids to the lake tomorrow. To put off an appointment with my oncologist one more day.

My husband just texted me. Deep breaths. In I go.

Its finally over..,153,ipsk6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/ipsk6l/its_finally_over/,24,1599725829.0,"Hey,

 I was diagnosed last August with DLBCL 14cm x 13,7cm x 7cm. in my abdomen. I went to see a doctor on 10th August, got my ultrasound on 16th and on 23rd had biopsy. It went so fast and Im extremely grateful to my doctor, who instantly thought it was cancer and sent me to ultrasound.

I started my chemotherapy on 30th August, 5 cycles of methotrexate, vincristine, etoposide, cytarabine, fosfamide and doxorubicin, it was hell. It shrunk my tumor by 95%, but there were still 5% left. So i got it removed surgically. They took half of my liver and gallblader. 

After that I had 6 months of immunotherapy (opdivo/nivolumab). Today i had my last appointment with my oncologist and he said that im finally done with it. Immunotherapy worked, but due side effects we had to end it. I got another ultrasound of my abdomen and they didnt find anything unusual. I have PET/MRI on 30th September, but my doctor said It is going to be 99% fine.

Im just so happy that it is done. These past 12 months were hell, but even in those bad times I made new friends, met new people and had near death experience, which change my view of the world. Im more grateful about everything I have and everyone near me.

For those who are still fighting, you can do it! I believe in you. I remember browsing this subreddit after my first chemo and thinking this is taking forever, I was in so much pain and thought it is never going to end but here I am. If i look back, everything went so fucking fast. 

I had to share this with someone, im so happy!

It took months to wrap my head around the fact that I may actually be able to live without a looming storm cloud over my shoulder.

Then Wednesday happened...

Turns out, my last scan showed some pretty aggressive activity, and in new areas. 

At this point I have no more options. 

I will be doing maintenance every 3 weeks of combination nivolamab and brentuximab until either 

1. the side effects become too much
2. it (the treatment) just stops working

There's not really a time-frame. Could be months, could be years. We haven't told the kids anything yet. After the holidays and birthdays are over in January, we will tell them the cancer is back and I'm doing treatments, but that's all they need to know for now. 

I just got used to the idea that I was going to live, this has been one hell of a cruel whiplash. I feel so terrible for my wife. Honey, I love you so so so so much. I wish we could've made better use of our time together. I wish I didn't waste our chance at finally having the life we wanted together in hospitals. I am so grateful for you doing everything you could to give our family a taste of normalcy, and even fun.

I didn't think I would be here... after everything... the transplants, the physical, emotional, and psychological hell...

I did have a good run, while it lasted. I've known love and loss, and I've laughed till I cried. I've traveled. Not as much as many, but enough to have gotten see some amazing things. I've known good and bad people, I've *been* good and bad people. 

so, what *does* an (albeit flawed) Buddhist with Asperger's, cancer, a wife and two kids think about his own mortality? I'd probably start to tell you, but I really don't think I'd have enough time (haha) 

so I guess this is it. Not everyone has the position of knowing when their time is pretty much up. I won't be tapping out early, I have no interest or need to do so. I do plan on trying to be happy. I don't think that means cramming everyday with excitement and adventure, but I do think there's a certain amount of seizing the day that i should consider.",2019-12-15 03:15:49

In 2011, he got diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and tumors had also spread to his brain. The hospital he got diagnosed at gave him a couple months to live, and had a extreme chemo and radiation set up. 


My dad quit smoking instantly, and left that hospital. He took all that info and medical records to City Of Hope hospital and got a second opinion. The doctors at City of Hope were astonished at the radiation/chemo intensity and told my dad the other hospital would have made him a vegetable if he had followed through. 


They did surgery to remove the tumors on the brain and some radiation. And gave him low dose chemo and radiation for the lung tumors. 

After that, he was in remission for 3 years. In 2014 he had another mass on his lung. More radiation and a bit of chemo. 


Since then, he has been in remission. Two months ago he had a scan and his doctor was scared because he saw some masses on his brain that resembled cauliflower and we had to do a biopsy to find out what it was. 

A month later ? He had another scan and it was gone. The doctor says it’s a miracle and my dads a walking miracle.

Even though he might not be 100% who he was before the diagnosis, he’s still here. He might not have the same energy, stamina, and mental sharpness as he once did but he’s still here. He loses his balance sometimes, and forgets things. But that’s expected after the surgeries on the brain. He’s my hero and it’s a miracle he’s still here

A somber celebration,145,hfpftr,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/hfpftr/a_somber_celebration/,17,1593132339.0,"One year ago today was the worst day of my life. I had finished treatment and at my first three-month checkup, my doctors told me that they saw little tumors in my bones. Until this point, they’d (mercifully) held off on explaining that my diagnosis is terminal. But when they saw the first metastases, they explained that curing me was impossible, and that they would only work to buy me time. If they trials didn’t work, I would have no more than 6 months.

But they have worked. I still have cancer, more metastases growing slowly in my body. I continue to feel good, to have energy, to feel happy. In the past year, I’ve climbed America’s tallest sand dune (entirely before breakfast), sipped tea on the beaches of Sri Lanka, built a pergola by hand in my own backyard, and adopted a dog of my very own. I’ve gotten to know my friends, and especially my family, in a deeper more genuine sense; we’ve all changed the things we value, and hold each other much closer than we did before. I’ve gotten much better at knowing myself. 

I guess my point is that I didn’t know any of this was coming. I didn’t expect any of this change, any of these blessings. I didn’t know how much of it would come from me. What’s going to happen can be forecast, but we don’t really know. The shadow of grief that I felt one year ago today is still there, but by wrestling with it, I’ve become more comfortable living with it. I have made space inside myself to allow it, and it is accompanied by joy and self-satisfaction. What we are facing here is very difficult, and I’m no guru or miracle worker who can promise it will get better. But the lesson I’ve taken from the past year still holds true: if you focus on dying, you aren’t using your time and energy to really live. So you gotta choose to do one or the other. 

I’m still going to die. But I don’t know when, and until I go, I’m gonna try to live every goddamn second. We don’t truly know how our lives are going to go, and we have to make sure some of the “what if” rabbit holes are good.

I lost my wife today,142,a9jii9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/a9jii9/i_lost_my_wife_today/,34,1545810522.0,"A few months ago, she was let go from her job and in the middle of the fight with the school board, she got her diagnosis. As if the job loss didn't already upset her, she was diagnosed with stage 3b colon cancer. She has been getting more depressed as the days go by. 

And today, on Christmas, in front of our young kids, my wife announced that she was leaving us. She said she was thankful to spend Christmas with us, but now that it's done, she doesn't want to be a burden to us anymore. She doesn't want the children to see her getting more sick. 

No matter what I said, or the children crying, she refused to listen. She already had two bags packed, and she walked out. I am completely lost and shocked and heart broken. I don't know where she's going... she won't answer her phone.  I tried calling the cops and they told me that since she left on her own, there's nothing they can do. I'm going to keep checking the bank account to see if she's buying anything anywhere. 

 The kids and I are just so confused. 

UPDATE: She withdrew $1000 from a bank branch this morning. While she has money to survive, she just made us short on money for the mortgage and other debts. I'm hoping my parents can help with that. ",2018-12-26 07:48:42

She held on until I got there and was repeating herself a lot but when I told her I loved her she was able to say “I love you too” and then she began calling for her own mom who passed away when my mom was 7. She’s no longer in pain and that’s the only thing that’ll ever keep me going is remembering how much she was suffering in her last few months. Sending love and hugs to all those still fighting the battle and those who are beside them hurting as well. 

Last night something weird happened. I would save all these little notes my mom wrote to me. She would write me good luck or I love you in the morning before leaving for work on the days she knew I had an exam and I have all the notes in the drawer by my bed. I haven’t opened that drawer in the last few days, nothing I needed from there. Somehow a green note ended up outside the drawer facing down, thinking it was garbage I go to pick it up as I was tidying my room and I look and it said “good luck (my name) ❤️” it was on a bright green sticky note that I didn’t notice earlier. It sent chills through my body.

I've posted quite a bit in here about my dad's journey. He's a 50 year old man diagnosed with stage 3C colorectal cancer February 2018. After 6 months of chemo and radiation, he beat cancer.

For a few months, that is. May 2019 it came back in his liver, boosting us up to stage IV. I was devastated. But after 6 more months of chemo, an outstanding surgery, and a bit more chemo, he was cancer fucking free in November 2019.

Flash forward to now, he had his first scan and blood work. I was so terrified. But his CEA level decreased even more to an all time low of 0.5!! I know we aren't out of the woods yet, but this small victory is enough to make me jump out of my seat and dance a jig. 

Thank you so much to this amazing community for all the support. I hope this story can serve as inspiration to everyone. 

Also quick plug for the amazing doctors that helped us on this journey. We are in Pittsburgh and see Dr. Remtulla as our oncologist and our liver surgeon was Dr. Gellar. These doctors played such a huge role in our journey and I owe them a million thank yous.",2020-01-24 00:47:21

It was completely unexpected. I usually sleep in the same room as her but last night I told her i'll sleep upstairs and I'll see her tomorrow morning. She was raising her arm high up (she normally don't even have the energy to even move her hand) continously. My dad took care of her at night until 330am and he went to his room to sleep because she looked comfortable. In the morning at 7am we realised she wasn't breathing anymore. We called the ambulance and they said it seems like she passed away 3 hours ago which was around 4am. I think my mom decided to let go when we weren't around. Everything feels so surreal now..I was wondering if raising her arms was her way of saying goodbye since she couldn't talk anymore.,2020-10-28 16:04:50

The prognosis was 20-22 months, not curable but treatable the Dr. said.

He died inside the day that he received that diagnosis, something in him just broke. I don't know if it was the meds, the disease or just the shock of the diagnosis but he just was not the same. He would be in and out, not fully lucid and just completely depressed which was heartbreaking to see since he was always such a jovial guy.

He had a lot of pain from his esophageal stent placement. He went through a round of chemo which was miserable for him but it finally seemed like he was getting better. And then he got a pulmonary embolism. He miraculously survived that but at that point he was just not ok. I didn't know what to do, he was just in so much pain, he was so tired. At that point the doctors are like he has a month or two without treatment. Maybe he'll get to Christmas if he's lucky. 

He managed to get out of the ICU where I was finally able to see him again only to go into septic shock 2 days later. He was unconscious and on a ventilator for about a week. We were ready to just extubate and ""let him go"" but then he became conscious again. He was not able to speak due to the tube but he could kind of write and he would understand us. He wanted to be extubated but the doctors didn't think that he could make it and my mom was not ready to do that.

He had a lot of ascites in his abdomen and chest. The ICU doctors suggested to put a drainage on his abdomen and drain his chest to make him more comfortable, and that it should help him to breathe on his own for a while. We finally made the decision to extubate him on Friday. I was able to finally be with him again briefly since my mom was the only allowed visitor. He was himself for a bit again. The next few days were really hard as he declined again. He needed a bipap machine to maintain his oxygen levels. He was delirious at times and he eventually just became agitated and wanted to take off his lines and go home. He asked my mom to just let him go, that he was just tired and ready to go.

Yesterday mom and I finally decided that it was time to move him to hospice. We signed the papers, they removed his lines, switched him to an oxygen cannula and moved him to a private room. He thanked us, and told us that he was just tired and he couldn't do it anymore. We reassured him, told him we loved him and that he could go, that we were gonna be ok. We told him not to be afraid, that his parents and his siblings were there for him, waiting to guide him to a place without pain, only light.

He eventually faded away until there was only his breathing, every time the breaths were more and more spaced apart. We held his hands, gave him foot massages (his favourites) and put cold compresses on his forehead. Just an hour later it seemed like he was just not going to be with us much longer, mom and I held his hands bedside and reassured him again of our love and that he did not have to stay with us longer, that he could go in peace.

Eventually he took his last breath. Mom and I looked at each other because we were not sure that he was gone. We tried to check his pulse but we were both too agitated to do so. Eventually the nurse confirmed that he had no pulse and told us she had to do some paperwork. We stayed there with him, fully knowing that he was not there anymore but still giving him kisses and messages of love.

My dad died on September 15th, 6 weeks after his diagnosis. 8 weeks ago, he was still mowing his own lawn, he was still sending me stupid jokes through whatsapp. He had some problems swallowing and eating but doctors just dismissed it as an esophageal spasm or a hernia.

I am so broken because the last couple of months I could have had with him I isolated a lot due to fear of giving my parents covid19, what I would give for him to be back at my parents place and us cuddled up in the couch watching TV and petting our doggie. I have dreams where I go to my old parents place (where we lived 11 years ago) and I find him sitting on his computer working on his latest project.

My dad was a brilliant man, a loving man, and in the end this disease ate his body up faster that we thought it was possible. I try to be consoled by the fact that his fight his over and he is reunited with his parents and siblings.

But I don't know how I am going to move forward with this pain. I mean, I have to, but I don't know how I am going to.",2020-09-16 23:18:30

6 months later it came back and metastasised into my leg. 9 round of chemotherapy later, no dice. Chemotherapy was a bust so I had another major laparoscopic surgery.

So not everyone knows about this but the summer of 2018 I was diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma and this was the worst thing that truly has ever happened to me and I was honestly so devastated. So that summer I was in the process of moving already and this just made everything so June 12 I went on a plane to Boston and no joke that day we met with the doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital and they confirmed what I had. So that entire summer I was busy kicking cancers ass which I took like an absolute champ and then I moved to Northfield Vermont and started school at Montpelier High School those who know military kids know that making friends is not the easiest thing to do but there are a few kids that welcomed me and to them I say thank you so much it actually means so much to me. So throughout the school year it was quite hard to not only keep up with all my classes junior year but also trying to get into school as often as possible was quite difficult as well. I also met probably one of the best person ever and that is my Girlfriend Savannah Tedder I have kept out relationship pretty private but I just want to say that she has helped me out this last 7 months so much and she means so much to me. I have also had many many awesome opportunities this year including meeting David Ortiz and some world champion Red Sox players as shitty this year has been I’m glad I have had some once in a lifetime experiences. On May 10ish I finished the final stretch of treatment and up until that point I had finished both chemo therapy and radiation treatment. Finally on June 21 I had the final full body scans and everything had come back positive with absolutely no signs what so ever of any evidence of and indication of cancer cells so it’s official I am now cancer free!,2019-07-01 06:12:10

Well 7 months my boyfriend(42) got diagnosed with stage 4 throat cancer. We’ve been together for 8 years and when this happened we were shocked as well as our families. Everything was going well, we started chemo in October every 2 weeks for 36 hours. This holiday season was rough but we both made it through. In January we had a second PET scan done and the results were great. The doctor was really happy that the cancer had shrunk and everything was going according to plan. We were happy because only 6 more chemo treatments and we could ring the bell!! Well mid February things got worse, cancer had spread to the bones and nervous system. He has been in the hospital since then. 

Yesterday was a good day, he was smiling and some what talking to us. But today everything changed. When I went to see him, he could talk and was heavily breathing. The nurse was talking about time lines to his parents and I. That’s when it happened. It hit me like a truck. This guy whom I’ve been with for 8 freakin years will not be coming home. This guy who I shared a home with won’t be back in it. Also the guy who I really love won’t be here anymore. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve kept the strong front for his parents and brother but they finally saw me break down and walk out the room. Just could do it anymore.

A year ago to this day I heard the words every 20 something year old and his family should never have to hear, ""You have stage iv cancer, and it is inoperable"". 

To hear these words spoke about ones self can't be described. I was numb, scared, shattered, and at the same time I had no idea what the hell was going on. To put a long story short, after two liver resections to remove five liver tumors, (one of which was in a tricky spot) 32 radiation treatments, chemo treatments, and a rectal resection, my latest CT scan shows that I am cancer free. I couldn't have done it without my family, friends, and girlfriend who stayed overnight on the couch in my hospital room for weeks on end. 

I just wish everyone who has been given the same original diagnosis could be blessed with the same uplifting news I received this morning. What scares me 
more than having to get updated scans to check if the disease came back is the fact that it is certain I will have people close to me, my age, who will have to endure the endless amounts of needles, tests, scans, and all that fun stuff that comes along with a diagnosis of this terrible disease.

She didn't ask me to do this, but I am sure that she would have wanted you all to know what happened because this community meant a lot to her.  

She always said it hurt when voices here went silent with no explanation.  She decided in October to stop pursuing treatment.  The immunotherapy drugs were only slowing down the growth of her cancer so Hospice was brought it.  They met with her at our home and decided that they wanted to bring her to their center to manage her pain.  I didn't know that would be the last rational conversation I would have with her... I would have thought of something better to say.  The level of morphine needed to manage her pain made it very difficult to communicate.  She became confused, unable to speak, and slept a lot.  She wanted to come home... she said as much by getting up and packing her bags.  She died here, in our old bedroom. It was November 4th. She was surrounded by family and friends.  Her last words were, 'I love you Andy'.  That's me, by the way.  I am sorry that I didn't  do this sooner.  This group helped her a lot.

Happy Story,133,hz48yo,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/hz48yo/happy_story/,26,1595924238.0,"Hi all!  I know that when diagnosed with cancer, stories about survival can be helpful. 

It’s been many years since I posted to Reddit or even looked at it. But years ago I did an AMA about my diagnosis with terminal cancer. I had been given two years to live (approximately). 

I have had numerous surgeries, have done 7 or 8 chemos, but 11 years later, I am still here. 

I was diagnosed with breast cancer that spread to liver and lungs. It is HER2+, one of the more rare and deadly forms. However, that turned out to be a good thing, as a year or so after diagnosis they started to do research and came out with anti-HER2+ drugs. Not everybody responds, but I did. 

I still go to chemo and have many of the problems that come with that. I’m not healthy, but I’m still here. I went from having a 12 year old who I merely wanted to see graduate HS, to watching him graduate from Caltech and get a good job in tech. 

I saw my oldest, who was 22, also get a good job, married a wonderful woman and then have children. My hair is grey, and I’m getting old (Although I still look pretty young!). I’ve lived a pretty good life and got many years that others didn’t. I’m grateful but think about my friends who died every day. 

But it’s starting to change, progress is being made and others will get those years too. 

The point is, hang in there. Do your treatments. You never know what can happen, and what’s around the corner. 

My nurses call me a miracle. I don’t believe in miracles, but I was at the right place at the right time. And I never wrote myself out. You can do that too. Good luck to all of you!",2020-07-28 08:17:18

Sharing my own experiences and giving advice has also been a form of healing for myself. 
My siblings and I have started to slowly clean her room and donate things here and there.

I have a large bag of thin scarfs she used to wrap her head, and some loose fitting hats she wore during chemo. 

I wanted to offer these to those who truly need it on reddit as a thank you. 
I will be offering packages of 3 pieces per person. First come first serve. 

I will of course wash everything before sending as well, and I will cover the shipping. If someone can also let me know how I can cover everything? There have been times I have received a package from the states and I had to pay customs before receiving the package. ( I am from Canada)

Thank you again and I look forward to sending these out!

I'm still receiving treatment. We'll reevaluate in March. They expect a recurrence at some point and will treat me with Keytruda then. Keytruda only works in 20% of urethelial cancer patients, but when it works, it can be a cure--a word I've never heard my oncologist say.

He was a healthy 50 year old man, who worked out regularly, didn't consume alcohol or drugs and took care of himself.

For 14 years he went through several treatments,  chemo, radiation, autotransplants of the medula, immunotherapy, and more. He always kept a positive view on it. Luckily the most part of his treatments were not too severe on him. They were brutally aggressive, that's for sure, but I think his positive attitude towards life and the desease really helped it not be worse than it could have been.

During his remission periods he decided to put into books his lifelong studies. He has been interested in theosophy and understanding who we are, what are we doing here and where we're going to when we die, for the most part of his life. He found an editor and he published 8 books and translated quite some books for the editor too. He found some meaning in the middle of all this. Everytime his health permitted he travelled with my mom (I would join them whenever I could too), gave seminars and really enjoyed his time here.

Last September he restarted treatment. This was one of the worst on him. I think he was tired too.  Battling cancer for 14 years it's not easy, even for the strongest. Everything happened super slowly, he was weak everyday, getting out of the bed just to go to the bathroom was a nightmare. My mom was really a hero here, taking care of all his needs, being there for him through this everyday, doing hospital runs and being his rock. Me and my sister live abroad so we missed this last journey.

Last month he was admitted to the hospital and one morning my mum was called to go over there. The hospital was closed for visitations because of the pandemic. She got there and he passed 10 minutes after. He waited for her to come to hold her hand one more time. 
We couldn't do a proper goodbye cerimony because of covid-19 social distancing measures, so we selected one of his favorite songs and had family and friends play it at the same time, from their homes. I brought some of his ashes to Switzerland so I can scatter them in the mountains, one of his favorite things.

Today marks 1 month he left this life. 

I just wanted to share his story and strength to mark this date. It is really amazing the length our Human strength can go.",2020-04-19 14:40:55
My mom consumed 800 calories today!!! We did it guys!,130,c16ibh,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/c16ibh/my_mom_consumed_800_calories_today_we_did_it_guys/,20,1560690864.0,"It's the small victories that count right?

My mom consumed about 800 calories today, which is probably the most calories she has eaten (or drank I should say) for months!!!

The main key was portion control. Even her high calorie boost drink. I would give her a quarter at a time in a separate cup every few hours. 
 
Her breakfast was a soft boiled egg with cheese toast, which I cut into small little squares. (Only ate about half but it was still a good amount of calories!)

I made a creamy tomato basil soup for lunch/dinner, which I gave a small portion in a bigger mug so it looked like an even smaller portion!! This is the first she would finish a bowl of anything!!

I also provided her fresh carrot/orange juice (about half a cup) every couple hours.  And Everytime she had to take medication (every 4 hours) I always suggested to take it with the juice rather than water. 

I am beyond proud of her. And if she can do it, you can too!!

We're all in this together!!!!!

When I got diagnosed, I had been dating a girl for 3 months. I told her to leave me, because I didn't know how the cancer would turn out and she should leave before we become too invested in the relationship. She refused to leave, and she stayed by my side. That lovely lady is now my wife! We got married just after Christmas. We expected the surgery and chemotherapy to make me infertile.

There was a post on here about how difficult it is to not give into despair when you have cancer and your situation sucks and yeah I just wanna get in on that! 

I have been paranoid about cancer all my life after I watched it kill my mother when I was little, I ended up a real hypochondriac because of that awful experience. And guess what! I still got cancer! I didn’t even manage to find it early, I found it stage four! Which quickly turned to terminal! My cancer normally hits women when they’re 50ish but I got mine 23!!! I didn’t even get the fucking time my mother did! So now I have to come to terms with my imminent death and also the fact that I’m going to destroy my wonderful fucking family when I die! We have already done this, we know the fucking score, they will miss me forever and they have to watch me slowly die now because I couldn’t even die in a freak accident! No, I had to have a long drawn out death which ends in pain and indignity! LOVE IT. 

Before cancer I wasn’t religious but I didn’t think on god much. Now I have so much rage for him. I know it’s becsuse I have no one else to direct the rage at but honestly, fuck him for doing this. For making my family suffer and delighting in that suffering being slow. Fuck him for giving everyone else cancer and letting some people do months of horrible treatment only to die anyway. You motherfucker. You sadistic piece of shit. When I die I’ll cut your head off and piss on your grave. I just want to cover your holy house with shit and drag you down to earth and show you the fucking five year old being held down so they can get their toxic medicine and the parent whose a good person and has kids but you’re still killing them anyway. If god is real, I think I’ll kill him. 

And you are the only guys who will see this rant. Because anger doesn’t help anyone, and people can only relate to cancer patients if we’re doing an upbeat Be Positive dance. I hate the hold that death has on me. Even now I’m scared God might send me to hell for this anger at his Greatness, this *disrespect*... I feel like I gotta be worshipping at his feet even as he kills me cruelly and makes it so my family is in pain for years. THANKS DUDE!

This went on for months. Every day my mom or dad would drive me to the hospital to sit and wait to be seen, then the hospitals would just send me home. Finally after staying in the ER waiting room every single day a doctor walked by me and looked at my eyes and started screaming at the ER nurses and told them to get me into a room because I was dying. I had lost 70lbs in less than a month. I was in so much pain that I would slip in and out of consciousness and apparently I would black out and just start screaming from the pain. The doctor who had them pulled me into the back ended up becoming my oncologist. After every test they could possibly do... They tell me it's stage 4 non-hodgkin Lymphoma, that the cancer was throughout my entire body and in my bones, that I'll never walk again because my sciatic nerve was crushed and then severed against my spine by a 6"" by 3"" tumor that was infused in my lower back muscles. I was told I was going to die by all the other doctors but the one who became my oncologist. I forget the name of the chemo but I believe it was supposed to be every month and a half and my chemo sessions were about 10 hours long. They later bumped it to once every 3 weeks. While I was in the hospital I ended up flat lining for 2 minutes... I can tell you when your body releases DMT ""naturally"" it's a strange trip... But my heart started again. Eventually I was in remission. I was still in wheel chair and on such strong 24 hour time release pain killers that I had to take 3 times a day that I would be mid sentence 15 minutes after taking one and I'd knock out, then I'd come to and continue talking like nothing had happened only to find out whoever was there visiting had left so I could sleep lol. My buddy had leukemia twice by the time this all was happening to me. I knocked out while he was over mod sentence and came back to with a sandwich sitting next me and him eating his sandwich. And the moment I started talking again like nothing had happened he started laughing his ass off. Apparently the same thing had happened to him so he knew exactly what was happening. Well, after about 2 years of being on these pain killers I decided I was done and quit cold turkey even tho I was told not to. My life was either me in a wheelchair or a lazy boy recliner because I couldn't lay down because of how painful it was. So with cabin fever and insane withdrawal all I could do was lift myself up and down in this chair for 12 hours or more a day for a couple months while watching nothing but shitty day time shows. I'd finally had enough of that and asked my parents to get me a walker. So I forced myself to start walking again using that. Fast forward a few months and started walking without a cane. So that was a summary of all the terrible stuff. While I was in the hospital and going through chemo tho, I always founds ways to mess with people. I always found was to mess with my doctors and friends and would always turn everything I could into a joke. I'll leave a couple of stories in the comments for anyone who's actually gotten this far.",2020-09-12 09:24:46
Time is getting short,127,h9j0kr,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/h9j0kr/time_is_getting_short/,25,1592265435.0,"My wife had a oncology appointment last Thursday on the 11th.  We both had a feeling of dread going into this appointment.  Over the last few months her recovery time from the chemo has been getting worse and worse.  This last treatment she never truly recovered from.  There was not a single day we would call a ""good"" day even by our lowered standards over the past 4 weeks.  Further more she had been experiencing more pain in her back and a tightness in her abdomen. So we went in to this appointment with the anticipation that her cancer was growing again and that she was also getting toxic from nine months of continuous chemo.

&#x200B;

We waited in the room for 45 minutes as the doctor was running behind.  When he walked into the room you knew immediately he did not have good news for us by his demeanor.  He was kind as always, but had to be direct concerning the scans.   The cancer in her spine is growing and has spread.  The cancer in her liver grew with numerous new tumors that were all almost 0.8cm in size.  The worst part was that her bilirubin count, which had always been stable, doubled in between her last two bloodwork samples.  This concerned him the most.  We were not four minutes into the meeting when he looked at her and said, ""Unfortunately I think we are at the point I have to ask you if your affairs are in order.""  Needless to say it was a gut punch for both of us.

&#x200B;

Basically she is a time bomb right now.  Her liver is starting to fail.  The tumors could grow and block the ducts or the tumors could just grow and cause the liver to stop functioning.  The increased bilirubin counts indicates that is starting to happen.  We go back in two weeks for more bloodwork and to visit the oncologist.  The oncologist said that if those numbers continue to rise dramatically we will likely have to make some hard choices at that visit.  

&#x200B;

Honestly the choices are not that hard.  There is another chemo we can try, but if it's going to only buy her time where she's miserable and unable to function she is not interested in that.  She is not strong enough for chemo now.  So we are taking two more weeks off of chemotherapy and will decide if we are permanently discontinuing at the next meeting.

Cancer just sucks.   We knew this was coming.  But knowing does nothing to lessen the emotional impact of knowing that the time is here.",2020-06-15 23:57:15

Many people who you hear ""survived"" cancer are in remission. They're often people who recently were diagnosed as cancer-free after finishing their meds. But, cancer often comes back within three years. It can even come back after seven, despite the rule you hear about ""being clear if you've gone seven years in remission"".

There are some lucky people who do 1 round of chemo and are cancer free for 40+ years, but they're not the rule. Cancer tends to be more chronic than that. But news stories don't tell you that. They make it seem like you either beat it or you don't.",2020-01-11 18:13:52

We were out with one of her friends yesterday and I'm chewing excel gum, this woman actually tells me to start chewing vegan gum instead because there's no aspartame and ""you don't want to tempt your genetics with your diet"".

I am an occasional drinker of coke zero and I dared not tell her how much aspartame is in a can of that. 

Even people who eat healthy get cancer. Cancer doesn't give two fucks about whether or not you put sugar in your coffee. 

As if I wasn't going through enough having people criticize my eating habits is just grinding my gears. 

It's so annoying how as soon as someone gets cancer everyone is a doctor/naturopath and is telling you about their wonky cures. 

The same woman telling me to eat vegan gum also recommended ingesting distills of kerosene and turpentine to my mom as a cancer cure. The gall! The fucking nerve! 

Its sad that these are my mom's friends but I know she needs them more than ever right now. I just wish they tried being supportive and not critical of what we're fueling our bodies with.",2019-06-16 21:44:06

It was shocking, especially considering I was only 42 with no family history. ""They"" literally called it a fluke. Finding it was a fluke. I had a horrendous open partial nephrectomy a week later and the recovery was awful. Sadly, though, the emotional aftermath was/is far worse. No one mentions that during diagnosis or before and after surgery. No one tells you that every sniffle brings a paralyzing fear. Every ache, every pain feels like being in a haunted house where something may be lurking behind the corner ready to jump out at you. That's the thing ""they"" don't tell you. Or at least no one told me. My mom still cries. My husband is basically walking around in that haunted house with me, gripped with fear every time I have to have a scan or mention not feeling well. What brings me to these thoughts, strong enough to make me write about it is that I have had a persistent headache for months now. Sometimes it's just a nagging type thing that I can brush off and ignore. Sometimes it is worse. 2 migraines in 2 months but hadn't had one in a decade previously. My memory has suddenly become iffy and I forgot which way to turn in an intersection recently (even though I have driven through it twice a day for 7 years). My balance is off and I've had to catch myself from falling several times in a few weeks. I can't tell you how many times I've joked before about having a brain tumor when I've forgotten something simple or done something ridiculous but I'd be lying if I said I am anything short of terrified right now. That's the thing ""they"" don't tell you! You will spend the rest of your life thinking ""what if that is..."". I have SO much respect for the people who are able to walk away from their diagnosis with a clear healthy mind but damn I'm not one of them! ",2019-04-05 04:57:29

It was scary how fast he deteriorated after that, there were times I didn't think he would survive to see the new year.

Two years later, and we just celebrated him 75th birthday. He's happy, healthy, and full of life. The doctors are telling him he may have beaten stage IV lung cancer. There's been no evidence of growth on any of his scans in over a year now. He has two more infusions and then they are going to take him off treatment and monitor for growth. Fingers crossed, there won't be any, and he can live out the rest of his days in peace.

A BIG THANK YOU to the doctors and physicians of Emory University Hopsital in Atlanta. I am so glad we went with them and not the first oncologist we talked to. (ALWAYS get a second opinion.)

Is anyone else absolutely exhausted from all the negatives of cancer?,119,dxg8ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/dxg8ci/is_anyone_else_absolutely_exhausted_from_all_the/,39,1573983848.0,"Not holding my tongue anymore. I’ve lurked here for a year or so- I’ve read and empathized with others, but I’m so tired of faking having a positive with everyone. Maybe someone here can understand. Apparently we aren’t aloud to be angry and pissed off. 

I was diagnosed with SCC a year and a half ago. I did Mitomycin C and Xeloda plus a horrid radiation treatment. Know what it cost me? Everything.

Know what I hate about having cancer more than anything else? The absolute financial ruin that decimated what’s left of your sanity and integrity. I literally hate it. 

A Middle Aged professional with a nice little apartment and just okay health insurance gets diagnosed with cancer. This after nearly a year of not feeling well and having to finally throw down with doctors to figure out what’s wrong with me. Almost all that time was spent waiting on referrals and then appointments which take forever. Once pathology had come back though, then you can get an appointment on a moments notice. 

I had three cats, a nice apartment, a decent savings and it’s all fucking gone. My life has been reduced to Raman, water and rationing eggs. That’s the face of cancer I see every day. 

I had to move from the east coast to rural Kansas because I couldn’t afford to live there any longer. Dropping two of your three cats off at the shelter because you can’t afford vet visits much less food was a real treat. I cried more over that than my diagnosis and treatment.

I’ve quit talking to family members and friends because I quite literally have nothing to say to them that isn’t an expletive. “How are you?” Oh I’m just fucking great. The radiation has left me with some pretty severe problems in my ass, want me to talk about it?

Or how about- I’m great - went to Walmart today and spent a good ten minutes debating between chicken and beef Raman and calculating tax. How was your day?

Im tired of the political bullshit surrounding healthcare. Who here thinks they should lose their home because they were unfortunate enough to get cancer? I don’t. I am so tired of it being a debate. Why is it a debate? Why is one person who has amazing insurance and a better financial situation - better than someone else who doesn’t?

I’m tired of checking the mail. I put it off as long as possible. God knows what disaster lurks within the mailbox. It’s nothing but anxiety. Oh hey it’s your insurance provider with more good news! We covered nothing of this procedure. Enjoy! 

I’ve pretty much given up dealing with specialists. 100 miles round trip isn’t just a lesson in stupidity, it’s not able to be maintained.

I feel defeated and that makes me angry. Being told it’ll be fine or it’ll get better makes me angry. Feeling impoverished makes me angry. Feeling tired all of the time makes me angry. I’m just angry and can’t stand it.

Screw the upcoming holidays. Everyone is gathering in Connecticut- too far and too much of a drive not to mention all of the other considerations. 

I’m angry and you know what? We are allowed to Be. I’m allowed to be angry. 

Cancer isn’t fun. There was no great eye opening life experience for me. I didn’t learn anything profound. 

Cancer is ruin. That’s all it is. That’s it’s job and it’s okay to be pissed I got it.",2019-11-17 09:44:08

She had cancer when she was 25 before I was alive and beat it. When I was 8 she got breast cancer and they had to mangle her breasts to save her life. she beat it, and then it came back years later, they removed the breasts and she was cancer free again.

Then she got it in her lungs, it spread everywhere and made her body waste away for years and years, her dying was my biggest fear and I planned to kill myself as a little kid after she finally died, I couldn't imagine excepting her death, she was my only parent because my dad is dead too. I slept in the same bed as her until I was like 13.

As it got worse and worse, she persisted on doing anything possible to survive, I never thought in a million years I'd get to the point where I was wishing she would just die and stop fighting, it was very very clear she was going to die at any moment. Yet she told doctors to keep her **off** the ""do not resuscitate"" list. If her heart stopped, by law they would have to give cpr.

And then she persisted beyond the point of *inspiring*. The day before she died, she was telling me in a gravely choppy voice (She could only speak whilst inhaling) that my sister was giving up on her for telling her ""it's okay to let go, you are going to die"". 

It was an unspoken rule that we don't tell her she will die, the doctors have been saying otherwise for years. She went on to start shooting ideas on how to survive. I'm a late teenager at this point, it wasn't too long ago.

She believes in god so I told her ""if you do die, you are going to realize you had nothing to fear after all. This isn't the end of you, or anyone in the slightest bit. You will be at such peace, you might even look back think being scared of death was silly! We aren't going to be separated and we never will be,"" etc. Etc.

My moms reaction? ""Please get me some vitamin C I need to survive"". (The vitamin C/alternative treatment is a whole other thing, she got desperate.)

The next day, her body is shutting down and she can't speak, her eyes are wide open and all the doctors are telling us she is dying and needs to get taken to another room where she will pass. My sister and I are asking her if she knows what's happening, and she is *barely* able to nod for ""yes"" she looked so scared and cried almost every day for the last few months, up until her last day. The doctors pump her full of morphine and took her off oxygen. It all happened so suddenly.

As she lay there breathing her last, awful breaths, the nurse suddenly starts looking for more morphine, and then runs out of the room to get more (it wasn't dramatic, I'm sure only I noticed.) She quietly rushes back in and injects more morphine. I think my mom was showing signs of distress, I was very focused on the nurse. She Injected even more at a certain point. I was the only one who walked away and couldn't bare to watch.

When my mom was on her last 5 - 10 breaths or so, she fucking suddenly opens her eyes, and leans her head forward and looked around at the people standing around her, everyone yelled for me to come over so she could look at me, and let her see I was there. but I was on the other side of the room and didn't get back in time. I saw her though, she looked aware and scared. She looked like she couldn't breathe. it was horrific.


Throughout the **entire** time, my mom refused to die, was scared to die, and suffered the whole way through and I've never talked about it. There was no ""farewell, it's my time now"" shit. If I was to use a metaphor to describe it, she was ripped away by the ankles leaving nothing but claw mark's across the floor.",2020-07-18 12:00:16

So I guess this is it. Having a 5.1cm mass now in the. Pleura but adjacent to the mediastinum as well as many other smaller growths they have downgraded me to “weeks”. It really is amazing because I feel fine. I have recovered well from a Hindquarter amputation/hemipelvectomy my latest scan shows the surgery caused hyper progression in the lungs. 

So my palliative surgery which did relieve my pain from the huge 20lb tumor ripping my leg to pieces has cut my life expectancy from months to weeks. The crazy part I really really feel fine, wouldn’t know anything was wrong if I didn’t have the CT which the surgeons didn’t want me to have.... just venting. I move to California to try and make it to MAID (medical aid in dying). 

My lung surgeon said she doesn’t thjnk anythjng is imminent but I can’t be operated on again while still recovering plus she thinks it would do more harm then good. I’m out of systemic options according to my medical onco, inoperable according to my surgeon and they won’t do any more SBRT according to my radiation onco. My performance status and prognosis prohibit me from most clinical trials. I truly have no more options to fight it.

If i can hang around a national organization may do a feature on me as I’ve lead quite the unique and interesting life. I may head to try and live a dream and do a little bit of awareness raising for sarcoma and MAID on my way out. Considering broadcasting my death with dignity live to raise maximum awareness about the condition. It at least let’s me feel like I have a purpose here at the end. 

Vent over. Good luck everyone.",2019-05-26 04:06:15

A year ago today, I wrote an emotional post about turning 27. So what right? Well, I was not supposed to make it past September/October back then and here I am a year later this morning to celebrate my 28th birthday after 20 months from being diagnosed. I am not doing anything special nor have ever really care about birthdays, but I'm thankful for many reasons to see this one. I'm thankful to have had a chance at participating in a trial this year that dramatically improved my case and to be alive to see another year go by even with all the heartache and pain I've endured and have had the past year to get to know all of you in this amazing community. Most importantly, I've seen and felt myself grow pretty damn strong. I only wish my grandmother was around to see my progress, the birthday gift I want most is a hug from her right now. But here's to getting through the final stretch and hopefully making it to 29 this time next year as a SURVIVOR! Cheers!

An update and a miracle,122,j6aw52,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/j6aw52/an_update_and_a_miracle/,15,1602038797.0,"Hi everyone. I posted here last month and received wonderful responses about my very dear friend, only in her early 30s with stage 4 cancer, terminal diagnosis. She was admitted to a hospice and was suffering from cachexia etc. She had chemo and immunotherapy and nothing was working. I seriously thought she was close to dying, as did family and the doctors.

WELL, in a turn of events. Her consultant had told her no more treatment as she was very ill after the immunotherapy and her scans showed progression. She told the doctor - try me on one more platinum chemo, for my kids! He was very reluctant and at this stage she had a syringe driver and was immobile. But he agreed. 

Slowly but surely she has started gaining weight. Her appetite is back with a bang! She even said this new chemo is causing barely any symptoms only nausea which goes way with the antisickness tablet. She was discharged from the hospice! She has been out walking every day and has been doing things with the kids, going to the play park and doing art etc. Heck she was even ironing and doing laundry the other day, unassisted!!!! She told me she can feel some of her tumours have actually shrunk (breasts and neck) and the pain is much less in certain areas to the point her syringe driver has been put down to the lowest amount. She is no longer sleeping all day and doesn't even need to nap. Her ""cancer clothes"" very small clothes are no longer fitting her. She is so much happier and optimistic now. This woman is the strongest and most tenacious person I know. I am so glad she is still here, for her kids and for us all.

Her syringe driver is due to be taken out next week and she will go back on an oral opiate for pain. But she has been taken off all the extra pain relief with her feeling better. 

It is like an actual miracle!!! She seen her consultant last week and he was amazed by her progress and joked that he was glad she forced him into doing one more chemo and that only 5% of people with her type of cancer respond to treatment. He booked her a scan so we are just waiting on the results of this. 

I just wanted to share this for anyone who is struggling just now to give a bit of optimism and inspiration. My husband a few months ago kept telling me to try and be open minded and positive about her, as I'd often be in a heap crying daily. I would get angry with him and say she has terminal cancer she isn't getting better. Well she has proved me wrong and my husband was right...for once haha.",2020-10-07 02:46:37

There aren't any more treatment options for him, so we're switching over to palliative care to relieve his headaches and nausea. Unfortunately he's mostly nonresponsive now and very confused and incoherent when he is awake. We have to keep him mildly sedated to keep him calm, because otherwise he starts trying to pull his IVs out and get out of bed (and he's a major fall risk). He probably won't be able to come back home because it won't be safe for him here and he needs 24/7 care considering his disorientation. The oncologist said she thinks he has a few weeks left, but not months.

I'm so sad. I miss him so much. I keep wanting to text him but I know he can't text back. Yesterday he was chatty but really confused. Today he doesn't give any sign of recognizing me or anyone else he knows. 

He was such a wonderful person before he got sick. Just outrageously funny, lively, active, stubborn, opinionated, talkative, brave, kind. He knew all the words to just about every 90s and early 2000s hip hop song ever written. I'm sorry none of you will get to meet him. We loved each other so much.

I am not an angry person, but find myself becoming enraged lately at two different types of posts.  The first, is the ""Is This Cancer?"" post by paranoid hypochondriacts or people who have not been to a doctor for even a preliminary finding.  How many times must we tell people we don't diagnose, to see a doctor if they're suspicious, & to obtain health insurance if possible, especially if they are worried about cancer?  Can we take a vote to ban these posts?  I want our sub to be inclusive, but seriously, this is getting old.  The second type of post is the ""Obvious Hoax Cures All Cancers"" post.  If lemons & baking soda cured cancer, do we really believe those of us who suffered through chemo, radiation, surgeries, transplants, etc... would have done so?  
I know we can somewhat control content with our upvotes & downvotes, but this is a small sub so even the zeroes show up.  Even seeing these posts are like a slap in the face to those of us suffering through REAL cancer & REAL treatment, be it us or a loved one.  This sub shouldn't be a home for science deniers or conspiracy theorists, we have r/conspiracy if you want to believe that big parma is interfering with cancer cures.  
So, I propose a vote to ban these posts.

Getting a CT scan on the 29th of this month to figure out how far it's spread, and how much the surgeons need to remove. Doctors have all told me I'm most likely going to be okay, and I understand that. I probably won't die. My symptoms aren't that bad, just a cough that has persisted for about 3 months. By all accounts, I know I'm lucky. I just want to get that out of the way, I guess. I *know* I'm lucky and I still have never been so miserable in my life. I can't focus on my classes, and I haven't been able to sleep for about 2 weeks. When I manage to get sleep, I wake up a lot during the night and have nightmares when I fall back asleep.
I'm tired of being poked at by doctors, even though logically I'm thankful for all of them and the work they're doing. I'm just tired. And even though I know I'm in good hands, and it's very treatable, I'm fucking terrified.

I watched her decline over the last few weeks, all that practice becoming observant to any changes during her chemo made it hard not to notice all the things that happen when things go south.....

Stage 4 adenocarcenoma, metastasis to the brain. Radiotherapy didn’t work. Chemo, immuno, smart, targeted, all of that... may have killed what was in her lungs but I guess once it crosses into the brain, not much else to do without collateral. 

My father, sister, aunt and girlfriend were there with us at the end. We were all talking and joking as I lay next to my mom, then I noticed she had not taken a breath, not in 20-30 seconds or so. I watched her, counting the seconds, got to 60 and I felt something break inside me. Turned to look at my sister and she knew....

My mom always liked to be in a room full of life around her, she hated being alone. I know she loved me and felt safe with me, and I know that my warmth and embrace comforted her. 

Why do I feel guilty when I drove away from her plot that I abandoned her? I know she isn’t in pain any more, and I can’t fix anything or make her comfortable anymore but I still FEEL like she needs me. 

I handled all the paperwork for the family, handled the hospital papers, morgue papers, burial arrangements etc like I was a damn robot. I felt numb going through it until the moment I drove away....... 

I know I’m rambling, I feel like this is the only place I can talk about this. I’m not ready to talk to my family yet, or my girlfriend yet. I just feel like letting go will be hard.

I flew to the Middle East for my mom, and I fear that flying back to my home half way around the world will sink me into a hole because I left her in the ground so damn far away.

I just need a path I can work towards. I will hopefully be going on a clinical trial which has had positive effects on stabilizing and reducing the cancer. I'm positive, despite the bad news.

&#x200B;

But I wanted to do this...This is something I've been thinking about all day. I want to make a declaration. Something that I can look back to and know without a shadow of a doubt that I will use all my mental and physical strength to fight this.

&#x200B;

I hereby declare that I will fight this cancer until it no longer exists in my body. I will not let it impact the quality of my life. I will not let it define me, my character or my love. We all live on borrowed time, and the time I have from here on out will be the most special, the most epic, the most meaningful I have ever lived. I will not let this mutation be a menace. I will take it, deconstruct it and turn this into an experience from which I gather strength and wisdom. When I look back on this declaration, I will know what I already feel in my heart and mind. I am stronger than anything which afflicts me. I am a survivor. I will be like a cockroach that lives through the toughest of times, only to make it out on the other side, as if nothing happened. There's no turning my back on this. I have family that loves me, friends and colleagues that support me. I will do it for them. I also have 2 lovely cats, Manny and Butler. I will do it for them too. I will do it for this community too. Let's kick some ass!!",2019-05-02 05:35:30

Less than a week ago she told us she wanted some time to herself, and then drove herself to the casino to gamble...she was fine, she was herself.... but the tumor eroded into a major vessel in her lung last night and she was gone before paramedics arrived.

What cancer feels like,119,fz0443,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/fz0443/what_cancer_feels_like/,32,1586622463.0,"I post this every few months, I think it sums things up perfectly. 

Written by hedgehog... 


What’s it like to go through cancer treatment? It’s something like this: one day, you’re minding your own business, you open the fridge to get some breakfast, and OH MY GOD THERE’S A MOUNTAIN LION IN YOUR FRIDGE.

Wait, what? How? Why is there a mountain lion in your fridge? NO TIME TO EXPLAIN. RUN! THE MOUNTAIN LION WILL KILL YOU! UNLESS YOU FIND SOMETHING EVEN MORE FEROCIOUS TO KILL IT FIRST!

So you take off running, and the mountain lion is right behind you. You know the only thing that can kill a mountain lion is a bear, and the only bear is on top of the mountain, so you better find that bear. You start running up the mountain in hopes of finding the bear. Your friends desperately want to help, but they are powerless against mountain lions, as mountain lions are godless killing machines. But they really want to help, so they’re cheering you on and bringing you paper cups of water and orange slices as you run up the mountain and yelling at the mountain lion - “GET LOST, MOUNTAIN LION, NO ONE LIKES YOU” - and you really appreciate the support, but the mountain lion is still coming.

Also, for some reason, there’s someone in the crowd who’s yelling “that’s not really a mountain lion, it’s a puma” and another person yelling “I read that mountain lions are allergic to kale, have you tried rubbing kale on it?”

As you’re running up the mountain, you see other people fleeing their own mountain lions. Some of the mountain lions seem comparatively wimpy - they’re half grown and only have three legs or whatever, and you think to yourself - why couldn’t I have gotten one of those mountain lions? But then you look over at the people who are fleeing mountain lions the size of a monster truck with huge prehistoric saber fangs, and you feel like an asshole for even thinking that - and besides, who in their right mind would want to fight a mountain lion, even a three-legged one?

Finally, the person closest to you, whose job it is to take care of you - maybe a parent or sibling or best friend or, in my case, my husband - comes barging out of the woods and jumps on the mountain lion, whaling on it and screaming “GODDAMMIT MOUNTAIN LION, STOP TRYING TO EAT MY WIFE,” and the mountain lion punches your husband right in the face. Now your husband (or whatever) is rolling around on the ground clutching his nose, and he’s bought you some time, but you still need to get to the top of the mountain.

Eventually you reach the top, finally, and the bear is there. Waiting. For both of you. You rush right up to the bear, and the bear rushes the mountain lion, but the bear has to go through you to get to the mountain lion, and in doing so, the bear TOTALLY KICKS YOUR ASS, but not before it also punches your husband in the face. And your husband is now staggering around with a black eye and bloody nose, and saying “can I get some help, I’ve been punched in the face by two apex predators and I think my nose is broken,” and all you can say is “I’M KIND OF BUSY IN CASE YOU HADN’T NOTICED I’M FIGHTING A MOUNTAIN LION.”

Then, IF YOU ARE LUCKY, the bear leaps on the mountain lion and they are locked in epic battle until finally the two of them roll off a cliff edge together, and the mountain lion is dead.

Maybe. You’re not sure - it fell off the cliff, but mountain lions are crafty. It could come back at any moment.

And all your friends come running up to you and say “that was amazing! You’re so brave, we’re so proud of you! You didn’t die! That must be a huge relief!”
Meanwhile, you blew out both your knees, you’re having an asthma attack, you twisted your ankle, and also you have been mauled by a bear. And everyone says “boy, you must be excited to walk down the mountain!” And all you can think as you stagger to your feet is “fuck this mountain, I never wanted to climb it in the first place.”",2020-04-11 16:27:43

I lost my mom yesterday,117,az564i,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/az564i/i_lost_my_mom_yesterday/,29,1552177702.0,"Yesterday I lost my mom.  She was only 58. She was battling stage 4 ovarian cancer for a little over a year.  I flew home February 14th to be with her when a few days later she was told there was nothing more that could be done and was put on hospice in her home.  She went through about 6 months of chemo in which she was platinum resistant, a hysterectomy, another few months of a secondary chemo, a pigtail drain, and finally a gastric drain.  

My sister, aunt, and I cared for her for the past two weeks throughout her hospice.  Yesterday at 8:31 am, she took her last breath and went to be with our Lord and her late father.  Watching my mom actively die was the most soul crushing thing I’ve ever experienced.  She’s no longer in pain now.  Her viewing and service is being held today and then she will be cremated.   I wrote a letter to my mom that I will be sharing at her service and I pray for the strength to be able to get the words out without breaking down.  Knowing I will not have her by my side for the rest of my life or my daughters life feels so selfish, but it is a real feeling I cannot dismiss.  I feel cheated, while at the same time I know she is no longer in pain.  

I will miss her with every inch of my heart, body, and soul.  I know time will heal my heart, but it’s so hard right now.   She was an amazingly patient woman who taught me to be strong willed, creative, and adventurous.  I love you my beautiful mom, forever.   ",2019-03-10 00:28:22
Lost my twin brother,115,8p6c7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/8p6c7w/lost_my_twin_brother/,36,1528364408.0,"I lost my identical twin brother last month to lymphoma at just 29 years old. I was sitting next to him. His head was on my shoulder. One second he was sleeping, the next he was just\- gone. It's been 7 weeks. 7 incredibly long, miserable, horrible weeks. To say I'm not handling it well is an understatement, which I guess is what brought me here. My brother always liked reddit. Said it would made him laugh, or forget about problems. I don't know, I always thought people online were mostly jackasses (no offense to any here) but I guess my brother just always brought out the best in people. He could find the good in everyone, find the joke in anything, zero in on the people he could horse around with and make everything a party. He always had his sense of humor. His reddit name was photonstravellight, if anyone here knew him. I never even had to make my own account, my brother would cherry\-pick the best stuff almost every day and send it to me. Made for a lot of laughs. Gonna have to do that myself now, I guess. Even had to go and make my own reddit account for the very first time, which just seemed surreal. I'm sad, and upset, and angry, and I alternate between wanting to break things and wanting to just sit in the corner and rock myself. My brother didn't deserve this. I'm the asshole, it should have been me. My brother had a future. He was a brilliant physicist. He played a mean fiddle. He was kind, and thoughtful, humble, and genuinely cared about everyone he came in contact with. He was the best person I know. I would gladly take his place. It should have been me. I did 3 tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, I should have been the one to die. Not him. He was by far a better person than I will ever be. At his very core he was a good person. Seeing him struggle through brutal treatments for 2 years and not be able to do a damn thing was a nightmare, but I thought it was a means to an end. I always thought someway, somehow, he would succeed just on sheer stubbornness. And even worse has been to see most of our mutual friends seem like they barely care. They mostly abandoned him when he was diagnosed (including his girlfriend at the time), the very few that stuck around seemed to give up on him in his final few months and mostly stopped talking to him. Then they all pretended like they suddenly cared when he died. And then just carried on with their lives the very next day, like absolutely nothing happened. Like he was just a speed bump in their lives. I always took for granted that having an identical twin meant I'd have a friend, a shoulder to cry on, someone to have my back, someone to play pranks on, (potential organ donor?)\- for my whole life. Now I have to face the next 40\+ years without him. There is not a day that I will not miss him. We were halfway through a bucket list goal of visiting every national park together. I have an unused plane ticket I bought him when we were supposed to go snowboarding last February and I had to cancel because of work. Wish now that I’d told work to kiss my ass and gone anyway. He was supposed to be my best man at my wedding next year. Not in a million years did I think the day would come that I would lose him. His funeral is this weekend, which just promises to reopen all the wounds that haven’t yet closed up. I don’t possess the coping skills for this. ",2018-06-07 09:40:08

What I saw him go through these last 2 months was like nothing I’ve ever seen.",117,jnh8kk,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/jnh8kk/my_dad_died_last_night_prostate_cancer_what_i_saw/,13,1604461285.0,"Unfortunately my father, 66, passed away last night. He was diagnosed in late August with stage 4 prostate cancer. It spread to his bones, lungs, basically everywhere.

Watching my dad go through this was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. He was taken to the hospital in extreme unbearable pain on 3 different occasions. On the fourth and final occasion, he developed a bad bacterial infection and later developed pneumonia, which is how he died. The pneumonia spread to one lung, then I watched him die in the hospital each day as it spread to the other.

For anyone who might be going through the same thing, read online about the signs that someone is dying. He was really starting to fall apart mentally, he would start showing signs of his memory fading and eventually he was hallucinating and seeing things. Luckily they weren’t angry or aggressive hallucinations, but watching him continue to fade away was really hard. I’m not sure I’m in a state where I’m fully processing what happened, really seems like more of this numb feeling of relief that it’s over, and he doesn’t have to be in pain anymore.

Cancer took away my dad, mainly because he never went to the doctor for a check up or physical. He just never went, despite showing plenty of warning signs.

If I could go back and do it all over again, I think I’d try harder to get him to go to the doctor. Unfortunately he was stubborn and just was always going to do things his way.

I hope nobody reading this has to watch a loved one go through this battle. It changes you. I can’t believe he’s gone, but again, I’m just so glad that he isn’t fighting an unwinnable battle anymore. Fuck cancer.",2020-11-04 03:41:25

I feel like I should be relieved, or jumping for joy that this chapter is coming to a close but I’m terrified.

As many of you know, my wife died of cancer a few weeks ago.

I've shared with you our journey (the good, the bad, and the ugly) almost from the beginning and specially during the last few months of her life, which were very difficult and painful to us both, and we needed a lot of support.

These past few weeks have been an intense emotional, physical, and mental commotion for me. I had to withhold most of my feelings during the two years I was her caretaker, and now the sadness, fear, anger, and pain are coming to me like a force of nature. Luckily, my friends and her friends are carrying me through this, like the true community of love she built for me and for them. Most days I think I won't survive this, but now and then I feel a bit of hope.

Last Saturday we got together and celebrated her life. This is something she asked us to do before dying and I've tried to honor all her wishes as much as I can, even if I'm tired or struggling with her absence. It was a beautiful moment. We built a mandala together using flowers, seeds and beans, and spices. We sang, we danced, we cried, we hugged, we laughed. It was a healing experience.

It had started in my pelvis but a few spots were present in my spine and ribs. At the beginning I don't think it looked that good. They immediately put me on high dosage chemotherapy which has NOT been fun. I've spent a lot of time in hospital as an inpatient because I get my chemo for five days in a row every three weeks. Neutropenia has been a BITCH and I keep ending back in hospital with infections too. However the side effects of the chemo aren't too bad in comparison to what others have, and the excrutiating pains I was getting before I was diagnosed in my ribs, back and pelvis  are non existent now since chemo has started. As well as that, one of my eyes started going partially blind due to a nerve being pressed on by a tumor.somewhere. Within four days of starting chemotherapy it was completely back to normal.


I had my first lot of scans done since diagnosis and yesterday I found out the results. The doctors are so so happy with how it's going. After just 3 months of chemo my primary tumor has shrunk from 5.5cm to 2cm!! And it's shrinking everywhere all over my body, with bits of it gone completely. They tell me they're going to do another 3 months of chemo, followed by 5 weeks of radiation in the pelvis... All going well it will all be gone. If it isn't, they said they will do some additional chemotherapy. They also told me they were no longer considering surgery since it doesn't seem needed. 

Maybe by June I will have put this behind me and get back to my life.",2020-02-12 01:15:57

It's not me that is going through the cancer but my stepfather. He might not be my biological father but he has been in my life for as long as I can remember and he has probably been one of the most positive influences in my life.

In February of this year he was diagnosed with an operable bowel cancer (no symptoms, just went in because a friend had bowel cancer). 3 days later he was in surgery and it was removed (quick shout out to the medical staff at St Vincent's Hospital) and was given a scan to verify it hadn't progressed. 5 days later he was informed it had metastased to his liver and he had 2 months with no chemo or up to 12 with. Fast forward to 16 days ago when the doctors gave him 2-14 days and I rushed home from my holiday in Europe.

My dads wish was to pass away at home so for the last 8 days I have been feeding him, administering medication, bathing him, and helping him relieve himself. For the last 48 hours he has been unable to speak or awake unless I move him to change his nappy.

My post isn't to highlight how fucking horrible this disease is but rather to vent about how he wasn't given the legal option to take his own life at a time of his choosing with the level of dignity we would all like. It has been consistent medication, confusion, embarrassment, and humiliation for him and I do not understand what we as a society are afraid of when it comes to death.

I will be calling and writing to my local member of parliament to remind them of the impact their decisions have on ordinary families and encourage him to push this agenda.

My most genuine and sincere apologies to anyone who reads this and it brings up negative emotions as that is the last thing I want to do.

My wonderful husband and best friend of 42 years died recently.    

He lost a kidney to kidney cancer in 2013.  

Shortly after that it was noticed that his PSA level was elevated and he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.     Bicalutamide, radiation treatments and Lupron shots followed and his PSA was reduced to zero (well, <0.01, as close to zeros as is possible).  We were so happy.  

In 2015 the prostate cancer returned and he started again on the bicalutamide and Lupron shots but it couldn’t be stopped.  

The cancer metastasised into his spine and the bones of his neck, the latter affecting his swallowing.  

He died 38 days ago, in my arms, in his sleep, at home.  He was pain free throughout it all - not through pain management, he was never in any pain.  

He was a wonderful man and I couldn’t have wished for a better husband and friend.  There are no words to describe how much I miss him.  There’s no longer any point to life.  No. Point.",2018-07-02 05:44:10

My mom lost her fight yesterday,114,ehsqv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/ehsqv8/my_mom_lost_her_fight_yesterday/,56,1577771387.0,"After less than year, my mom's short and grueling battle with cancer has come to an end. She was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer in April and had a total laryngectomy in May. Then she did 6 weeks of chemo and radiation which resulted in clear scans as of September. Her PET scan done the week of Thanksgiving showed evidence of metastatic cancer nodules in her lungs. She was still waiting on the answer if she could be an immunotherapy candidate (she was too weak for chemo, radiation, and surgery) but her health rapidly declined before she had an answer. We found her barely able to breathe last Sunday and she was admitted to the hospital. On Christmas day she decided to go onto hospice. She was with us for a few more days (even though she wasn't really conscious) before she passed peacefully in the early hours of yesterday morning. We spent almost every minute with her, for which I am grateful. 

I'm still processing this. It makes me relieved that she's no longer suffering, but I also feel so many other emotions. She was on this Earth for 58 years and thankfully only this sick for several months.  While this situation sucks, she fought hard. 

She was a compassionate person, a dog lover, a TV aficionado (especially crime shows like ncis), an enjoyer of all foods (except cauliflower), and the best mother I could have asked for. Her sense of humor could always have the most serious of people laughing. She was a Philadelphia Eagles fan her entire life and I am 100% certain she had something to do with that crazy win last night. 

I will always love you, mom. 

Thank you to this sub for all of the support over the last months. I didn't post too frequently, but I was constantly on here reading the posts. I wish you all peace no matter how this disease is impacting your life.

I was able to get through my first week of surgical residency (intern year) before having to go home. 

He went into severe hypovolemic and septic shock. It was fast, on the night he was admitted to the ICU he was up talking and I spoke with him at 11:00 PM. His last words to me were “I love you babygirl, don’t worry about me and have a great day at work tomorrow”. Less than 24 hours later he was intubated, maxed out on four pressors, on CRRT (continuous dialysis), was hypothermic and in shock liver. I asked for a sign from my dad that he was ready to go and a couple minutes later he started bleeding from his central line site. I asked the palliative care doctor, who confirmed he’d gone into DIC - essentially his blood stopped clotting. I’d had a patient of my own go into DIC and it was extremely traumatic for providers and family. I knew it was his time. 

My dad was the greatest man in the world. He was loved by every single person that met him. He was a lover of a well mixed Canadian club cocktail, his Weber grill, his tritoon and cleaning the countertops. He was the most organized and responsible person I’ve ever known and it led him down the path to great prosperity and happiness. I made several promises to him on Thursday - that I’d take care of my mom, always keep my house clean and treat every single one of my patients in his honor. 

We are devastated, and shocked by his absence. I posted here about a month ago and got great support so I want to thank you all for that. I decided to go into radiation oncology as a result of dads fight and I’m so glad my life and career will be spent fighting this awful disease. Thanks for reading ❤️",2020-07-12 22:38:20
Love and Leukemia,114,drp6bn,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/drp6bn/love_and_leukemia/,15,1572934407.0,"This isn’t a story about being sick, this is a story about being in love. I don’t think anyone believes when they are swiping right and left on Tinder in their late 20s/early 30s, “let me make sure to pick a partner who will stick by me when I get leukemia.” But maybe that’s what we should all think about when we pick a partner. It’s easy to fall in love when everything is sunshine and roses — healthy, financially secure, attractive and secure, able to control all bodily functions and untethered to an IV pole. 

When I met my husband we had a traditional dinner date. We talked for hours and we both quickly knew “this is it”. On our second date he told me he believed we were together in a past life. I thought he was a little out there but I found it sweet, endearing and sincere. As our relationship progressed I knew this guy loved me more than anything in this life. I didn’t know he would be the perfect partner to me during a cancer diagnosis and treatment but I knew he was it. He was that guy. He would love me no matter what happened. If I got fat, if I said something uncouth as I often do, if I spent my morning hungover and puking — I knew he would love me no matter what. I loved him the same, I felt it in my soul, an innate certainty. The cliche phrase “when you know you know”, it was true. 

Getting the leukemia diagnosis was a shock, to say the least about the most. We barely had time to discuss it when I was rushed into treatment. He immediately became everything — my caretaker, nurse, chauffeur, pharmacist, cook, cleaner, everything. Every duty I previously had in our household immediately became his responsibility. He refused to let me spend a single night in the hospital without him by my side. He slept on that awful hospital futon for 21 nights straight and many more after that. His devotion to me was and continues to be unfaltering. He would meet other spouses and caregivers in the hospital pantry room and they would be exhausted, exasperated, depressed. He told me that would confess to him their frustrations, sadness, self-pity. He would come back to my hospital room furious — how dare these people have an ounce of self-pity when their spouse or loved one was the one suffering and fighting for their lives. None of this came as a shock to me, I knew who I married but at the same time, you never *really* know. 

Friends and loved ones who witnessed my treatment, hospitalizations, bone marrow transplant and subsequent complications also bore witness to my husband's love, support and devotion. This has been the greatest gift, the only brightspot in this shitbag, nightmare diagnosis that has overtaken my life. Everyone, including my mom, who had a little hesitancy about him in the past now sees what I see. Knows what I know. I still can’t speak of it without crying because the overwhelming love and gratitude is so intense. 

I guess I wanted to write this because, for anyone still looking for love, and looking for a partner, you should look at them and make sure they will stick by you “in sickness and in health”. It is an easy phrase to repeat. It is easy to let it pass through one ear and out the other but extremely difficult when it punches you in the gut. Pick a partner who will love you even if you can’t have sex with them for 15 months. Pick a partner who you will still love you if they see you at your absolute worst, and vice versa. Pick a partner who will love you through leukemia.",2019-11-05 06:13:27

It might’ve been a “had to be there” moment.

&#x200B;

At any rate, he was so clever and quick, smart as a whip, fast-talking and sometimes depressed. He would ask if he was messed up because he sometimes had darker thoughts. I would hug him and remind him how amazing and special he was. Not just to me, either, but to everyone that met him. We played D&D, and he was a video game nerd. His friends told me he had a special talent for finding the best games. He knew a lot about weaponry and owned a few swords. He had a few collectibles, too. Never opened them. He liked to preserve things. He’s an incredibly gentle soul.

Fast forward to yesterday. They (Northwestern) reviewed the pathology. And the CT. Final treatment plan? No additional surgery, no radiation, no chemo. I'm in remission. Woohoo! I have an MRI and a CT scheduled for Sept 1 to recheck my arm and to keep an eye on the nodules in my lungs, but they're not worried at the moment.

Job Let Me Go,111,jcfrh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/jcfrh9/job_let_me_go/,37,1602903017.0,"I started a new job in June, small company but everyone there seemed team-oriented and I loved it. It was primarily office-related duties that helped the higher-ups free up time for important things; answering phones and filing, that sort of thing. 

A month into my work I find out I have breast cancer. Stage 1C. Sadly this wasn’t my first go-round with cancer and I’ve been let go from jobs due to missing work for surgery/recovery/treatments so I went in to HR and very directly explained my situation. I told them I loved my position but that I understand they have an office to run and if they needed to let me go they can just tell me now.  An hour later I have a conference call with my immediate supervisor and she tells me that my position will be there when I’m recovered, that I’m a “gem” and even pack up a monitor and my desk phone to socially distance / WFH pre-surgery. I was so relieved and happy. 

Double mastectomy, 6 weeks go by and I start feeling better. I send a few messages but no one responds to my emails. I try texting. Nothing. I get ahold of HR again and she says “That’s strange...let me get back to you.”  

The next day, I get an email from HR that basically says they’ve decided to go in a different directions and sorry, you’re done. I was flummoxed.  Really, that’s how they tell me?

Then today, two days later, I get a nasty email from her saying they need their equipment back.   I said I can get it to her one day next week. I also asked for a receipt of return. She gets super snippy and says she’ll leave one with receptionist. 

My thing is...you’ve just let me go during a pandemic with no notice and I’m recovering from breast cancer, but your biggest priority is Avaya phone and dinky monitor?  What is wrong with people???

My cancer is back,115,j9irkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/j9irkw/my_cancer_is_back/,35,1602499153.0,"I was cancer free for over a year. Now it’s back. I don’t even know what to think. I feel numb.


Update:
So I posted this about exactly a week ago. Since then a number of things have happened.

My original cancer was a freaky, super rare type of sinus cancer, with metastasis to lymph nodes on my neck. I underwent a massive round of surgeries last year, as well as radiation and chemo. Since then quarterly checkups have shown no signs of it still being there.

This summer I noticed the tiniest red bump on my shoulder/back. Like a mosquito bite, and that was what I thought it was for a long time. But it never went away, it was itchy and I had a history of cancer.

I showed it to three different doctors, including my ENT, who all said this was nothing to worry about, but they removed it and sent it to histology just in case. And guess what, it was cancerous... That was the bleak message I got on Sunday/Monday a week ago.

So this Wednesday I got a call from the hospital, where they had already set up both a «scanning day» and surgery for me. Thursday I did several scans and had physical checks by plastic surgeons. Friday I had surgery where they removed a huge chunk of skin around the bump that I had already removed, all the way down to the muscle as it went deep. They also took out a lymph node from under my arm. They are going to check it for metastasis, and I will be notified in a couple of weeks. If it is cancerous I’ll need further treatments and more surgery.

The thing is, they say this is a new type of cancer, not even related to my first! Apparently it’s an atypical malign melanoma, with cancer cells that are hard to define(?)

So I’m sitting here like... I’m not even out of my 30’s, and I’m getting two (atypical) cancers in two years? What the hell is going on?

I do feel completely defeated at the moment. Last year I had the will to fight, and I fought it. I’m somewhat traumatized by the experience, but I fought it even though I knew my odds were low. This time it feels different. I’ve struggled with PTSD and depression since last time, as well as other aspects in life have hit me pretty hard. It’s like I don’t even care what happens to my body, or if I even survive. Even if this time my odds are a lot better, it just feels like I have less to fight for.

I guess I’m still in shock, and shouldn’t be so hard on myself. Hoping it gets better. Heavy painkillers are probably messing with my mind as well.

Also, thank you for all your support! It means the world!",2020-10-12 10:39:13

37m stage IV colon cancer. Colon tumor removed, but ~11 mets on the liver. 9 rounds of FOLFOX + Vectibix so far. Before chemo the surgeon said he couldn't do anything about the liver mets because they were evenly distributed across the liver, but maybe if the chemo worked he could do something down the road.

Today I saw the surgeon (surgical oncologist) again. He looked at my most recent CT scan, and said my response to chemo was ""miraculous"" and I'm having as good of a response that we could hope for. The biggest spot is the size of a thumbnail, and many of the smaller spots are no longer visible. There's a few scar-like spots he can see.

He wants to do surgery to remove 1/3 of my liver, and also ablate (burn off) any abnormal spots or scar tissue on the remaining liver. He'll also remove my gall bladder because it's in the way. He wants to pause chemo until after I'm recovered from the surgery.

This is what I've been hoping for since the start. I'm a bit nervous about going into surgery again and the recovery. I'm excited to get a couple months off of chemo. If everything goes well, maybe I'll be done with cancer by the end of the year!",2020-07-21 03:33:49

Back in March my boyfriend was diagnosed with Stage 4 terminal colorectal and liver cancer with tumors that were in the 8-11mm range. He has since done 6 rounds of chemo (IV plus one week pills, one week off). 

His CEA numbers shot way up from 600 range at diagnosis to 3300 range and the doctors were concerned that they may have missed cancer somewhere else. They did another scan and thankfully he is clear everywhere else, his tumors have shrunk, and the CEA levels (as hoped) were due to cancer cells dying off. They also increased his chemo treatment because he was handling it so well.

He is no longer considered terminal as they now can operate due to the tumors shrinking away from the important arteries. Next up is two more rounds of chemo (just had his infusion for first of the two yesterday) and then planning for surgery.

I'm a 34 M who was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer in May of this year.  The cancer is in my left lung, but has moved to my lymph nodes in my chest. The largest tumor in my chest was a 3 by 4 inch tumor around a node.  Being so young and with very little symptoms, several doctors gave me anywhere from 1-2 years. Within one month I was coughing non stop, and breathing was becoming difficult. 

I have just completed 6 rounds of chemo and immune therapy, a drug called Keytruda over an 18 week period. CT Scans after only 4 rounds showed a decrease in all my tumors of at least 50% and in some cases the tumors were gone completely. The doctors called this a partial response, and were super happy.  My cough and breathing problems have gone as well. 

As it stands now I will continue treatments every 3 weeks for the next two years, if I make it that long. I've had almost no side effects from the chemo, or therapy except for a bit of flu like symptoms for a few days after each round.

&#x200B;

My 61 year old father died on a beautiful day in June.  I know that's cliché, but it really does seem jarring when the weather doesn’t line up with this crazy internal turmoil.  Didn't Mother Nature know my family's world was falling apart?

&#x200B;

Hospice gave my father 3 months to live, but ultimately, it only took 3 weeks.  It was breathtakingly fast.  The wonderful hospice nurse deftly read all the signs and let us know, more or less what kind of time we actually had.  I arrived the morning of his death to see a drastically different person.  He was gaunter than I had ever seen him.  The breathing was ragged and harsh.  His eyes wouldn't close or blink.  My heart turned to liquid and I drank it in my stomach.

&#x200B;

Throughout the day, I had an intimacy with my Dad I hadn't had for years.  I rubbed his feet, and felt the ridges and muscles under the skin.  I held his hands and noticed how wide and flat his finger nails were, that he had a healing cut on one of his fingers.  His smell.  The color of his eyes.  

&#x200B;

I read that the dying can likely hear during spells of semi-conciseness.  I talked about his grandchildren to him.  Talked about what was going on around him.  That we loved him and generally tried to keep it peaceful.  His anointing of the sick was really beautiful.  

&#x200B;

As the hour grew near, people came and went until it was just his wife, his sister, and me in the room.  My sisters from the coast were coming as fast as they could but wouldn't make it.  He took his last breath that looked like all the other breaths before it.  And then he was gone.

&#x200B;

My father contracted HPV16 in his younger years.  The virus worked on him and worked on him.  And then the chemo worked on him and worked on him.  And then the radiation worked on him and worked on him.  And then the tumors worked on him and worked on him.

&#x200B;

And you know what, there's a vaccine for all this now.  Gardasil inoculates against HPV 6, 11, 18, and you guessed it, 16.    It's mostly targeted for girls due to cervical cancer, but my Dad got head, neck and throat cancer, so please give it to your boys.  He didn't take the diagnosis with shame.  He and my step-mom leaned into it talking openly about it, and told everyone to get the vaccination.  It's not perfect and doesn't protect against all strains, but it gets at some of the worst ones.

&#x200B;

And now when I run into anti-vaxxers, I want to vomit.

"My hero, my sister.",107,bgq9uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/bgq9uq/my_hero_my_sister/,42,1556108567.0,"Last Thursday my 38 year old big sister took her last breath. She left behind 2 teenage boys that she asked me to take care of. I promised her I would.

As I prepare for the service Friday by getting photographs together, and trying to write something to honor her with, I cannot help but reflect on the past 2.5 years that she fought this disease. This is her abbreviated story. The full story was much more arduous.

She had finally found her perfect match. They got pregnant, but she miscarried, and went to get checked up. They found abnormalities and sent off for more testing.

My sister told me she had cervical cancer in February of 2017. I remember the shock I felt sitting at her kitchen table. I was numb. Our family has never been close to cancer. I cried. I toughened up and told her to fight it and beat it. 

She had a radical hysterectomy and a great gynecological oncologist reported clear margins. Great, now sometime to recover and heal. My wife told them that she would carry a baby for them if she wanted to. We thought there was light at the end of the tunnel.

About a month after her surgery, she had severe abdominal pain and pain in her right side pelvic area. The cancer had returned with a vengance. It had spread to some outlying pelvic areas but had not metastasized. Radiation and chemo we're next.

She went 5 rounds, but there was a severe pain that would not go away and the tumor was blocking her utera. They gave her a nefrostomy bag to relive the backing up of her kidneys but could not operate due to arteries and other delicate organs, and radiation was too risky. So they continued to try chemos. She went through a couple of trials.

2018 was a year of fighting. She battled the cancer through chemo and radiation. She changer her activity and diet. She searched for holistic and alternative medicines. Everytime I saw her she was working on something new. During this time she continued to raise her boys and keep her spirits up. She refused to give up.

We held a benefit to help with travel costs and she was so grateful and did as much as she could to help. But late last year they found the tumor had grown slightly so they ended her participation in the trial.

Her pain was always unbearable. They would try to find drug combinations to keep the pain down, but allow her to stay awake. She slept, and slept. She got weak, she stopped eating. Her last image was taken and the radiologist said there was something in her bowels. I don't know if it was cancer or a blockage, but she went from being able to talk and text, to nothing. 

She is gone. Our family is devastated. We have all banded together and will get through this. Her memory will live on in the stories I tell. Her legacy will live on in the children she leaves behind. 

My broken heart aches for my parents. My mother stopped everything to be her caregiver til the end. She will not leave my sister's house, and I can't blame her. My father spent countless hours at my sister's bedside. He would work tirelessly on her home projects she felt had to be done before she passed. 

She had a heart of gold and would help all strays (animals or humans) and a competitor's drive.  My twin boys adored her and she fought long enough to meet my third child in January.

I love you Sis. Til we see each other again.

"22,Last year was the best in my life, and was on my way to realising my dreams, yesterday I found out I had Ewing's sarcoma",104,d7pce9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/d7pce9/22last_year_was_the_best_in_my_life_and_was_on_my/,48,1569181525.0,"I'm a 22 year old male who's soon to be 23 this Tuesday and here's my story: 

I grew up in a good loving family, which I'm thankful for, but  growing up my life outside the house wasn't something I'd look forward to. I was the skinny kid in school, so I got bullied pretty much every year in school until I changed highschools. It once got so bad I stopped going out altogether for a good 3 years, my eyes would burn if I saw the sun, my peers were socialising and building their personalities, while I was becoming lonely, awkward, anorexic - but thanks to my family  never depressed - , everyday I go to sleep I'd dream of being fit, funny and talkative like when I was a kid, maybe even fall in love!

At 17, I had to change highschools due to course availablity, I met some of my primary school friends, who are really good people, and helped me build myself back up. Over the next few years started taking care of myself, trying to become socially adept, athletic, and all around a great person. There were some hard times in that journey, mainly at 20yo I lost almost all my college friends because of my scoial skills ( I had a feud with a girl in our group, and I handled the situation badly ). But hey, I stood up again , and this time I was actually becoming a functional person and a friend, last couple of years i made a best friend, few more good friends and socially things were perfect.

Meanwhile, I also was working towards my fitness, took a good 4 years to stop getting injured and get the diet right, but I finally did it, last year I was swimming 2 miles twice a week easily, was running track and my cardio was phenomenal, in the gym I increased my bench from 40kg to 90kg for reps. I even started getting some looks for the girls in college! I asked someone out, but as it was my first time I fucked it up.

So about February 2019, I start getting this pain in iliac crest, but only when contracting my abs/hip flexors, but since I was working out so much, I figured it was tendonitis ( I mean I'm a medical student, I can't be possibly wrong right?). The pain kept coming and going but every time it stayed a day longer, and my hip muscles started getting stiff and my butt muscles aching a bit, i started to think it was a bone related issue, but I'm a healthy 22 year old, with no history of cancer in the family.

4th of August 2019, I wake up with some mild butt pain ( back pain I thought, for sure ), that evening I go for a run despite  the pain, and as soon as I go back home, the pain goes from a 1/10 to 5/10, so I took antiinflammatory drugs and went to bed. Next morning I wake up with excruciating pain in my hip. I decide to take a radiography of my pelvis, just to check if anything is wrong with my hip bone, I do that and go check with a orthopaedic surgeon, he doubtly says it's more likely tendonitis.

Over the next 5 weeks, I sit on the pain, my front hip is becoming better and painless, while my right butt is alternating between pain, and cramp like feeling, it starts to mess up with my daily life. My doctor mom finally convince me to go take an MRI this Thursday.

I go into the MRI laying down - the most painful position for me -, I tough it out, the technician enters the room, tells we're doing another round, and gives me support for my legs fo the pain , now I'm thinking I probably just moved a lot and they're redoing it. Another 20m goes by, he comes back, but now with a contrast chemical, a nurse comes in and starts asking about my hip history,
""fuck this is bad"" I thought. I go out of the MRI, just to be told I need to do a CT scan.

Saturday, I go with my family to the clinic to get my results, I let my doctor parents take them while I watch formula 1 qualifying, I hear the nurse call my name, I  stand up and look for parents, my dad os holding the paper, shows it to my mom who turns her head in that "" this is the worst thing that could've happened "" manner"". That moment I knew. 

I'd like to finish by saying, I knew I was special, but not special enough to get a 3 per million bone cancer.",2019-09-22 19:45:25

I was diagnosed at 15 with Ewing’s sarcoma and over the past 7+ years, my cancer has come and gone a number of times. As far as treatments go, I’ve basically had it all (standard chemo, surgery, radiation,high dose chemo with an autologous stem cell transplant, clinical trials, kinase inhibitors, etc.) My relapsed Ewing’s sarcoma has been progressing. It was fairly slow at first but now it seems to be picking up speed. A few previously radiated areas (which had been thought to be dead or at least mostly dead) are coming back and new areas are appearing as well. I’ve been in this situation before, the only difference now is I’m running out of viable treatment options AND my bone marrow is so depleted from years of chemo and radiation that my counts don’t recover super quickly. Long story short, my oncologist told me yesterday I probably had 6 more months of “decent” quality of life. This news is extremely devastating, especially considering I’m just 2 semesters away from graduating college.

I’m currently on a regimen not frequently used in Ewing’s sarcoma (cyclophosphamide, vinorelbine, and Temsirolimus) since it’s arguably the most effective and least taxing/side effect-causing option I have left. Despite the spread of my tumors, there currently aren’t any “problem tumors” which pose a super immediate threat to my airway, heart, etc. Furthermore, aside from chemo side effects, I feel fairly normal and I’m not in a ton of pain, which makes the 6 month prognosis harder to fully wrap my head around.

I want to know other people’s experience being in the same situation. Did you or your loved one outlive your timeline? Or did death come quicker than expected? Was there anything that helped during this time? I’m just not sure how to live my life at this point since all the bigger bucket list things I want to do (most of which are travel related) are probably not doable with my current chemo regimen. Furthermore, I don’t know how to break this news to my friends and classmates. Telling people I have cancer is tough enough, I don’t even know how to approach telling them I have 6 months.

His surgeon was planning on removing 70% of his liver, letting it grow back, and then removing the remaining tumors. When he went in for surgery, they found that the tumors were too close to the veins. And if they cut those out, he would of died. So the surgery was cancelled. Next step, radiation.

I wanted to share this with y'all - today is officially my last day of treatment for stage 3b colorectal cancer :) I am currently not showing any signs of the disease.

I still have a little ways to go before I'm all done (scans, getting my port removed, planning and implementing how to treat my new body to never have to meet this disease again, etc) but today is the day I get my 5fu pump removed from my port for the last time.

12 chemo treatments, 28 radiation treatments, 1 surgery, and a few complications later.

I'm beyond excited to stop living my life 2 weeks at a time!

It has been a hard road for me but I know it could have always been worse. For instance, I walked in and out of every treatment, which is more than I can say for some of the others at my treatment center. I choose to shave my head (for non-cancer, non-chemo reasons). I get to come home to my beautiful wife and loving dog every time. I now have the absolute best doctors (that listen and learn when they need to), nurses, and staff I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. 

Plus, I've had this sub and the related Discord! I've shared this resource with other patients and staff, as it's been instrumental for my psychological well-being. Thank you all :)

&#x200B;

April 17th a day that will live in victory. It will be my final treatment of chemo. I am half way done killing the possible tumor babies (I had a positive lymph node that had cancer, so my cancer metastasized, the tumor was 5 cm in size). Once I am finished and my port is removed I will instruct the nurse to throw the fucking artifact away, I will cut off my damn wrist band and throw it in the god damn trash, I will throw away my key chain cardboard cut out and my wallet insert that gives information about my port - I WANT NO FUCKING ARTIFACTS OF MY TREATMENT AT ALL!!!!! I will have a scar and a permanent ""sun tan"" on my chest along with a permanent ""tattoo"" on my wrist (a freckle)

&#x200B;

I will only have 25 sessions of radiation - and then I am fucking done with cancer treatments. It is just 5 years of a hormone estrogen blocking pill. Then it is ""occasional"" checkups. The ""big annoying stuff"" that steals my weekends are just about over!!!! Chemo taking 3 hours to get done, radiation 40 minutes at the hospital (procedure is supposedly 20 mins but for some reason I have to stay for 40 minutes 5 days a week for 5 weeks).

&#x200B;

I'm tired of fucking fighting, I want my normal life fucking back!! I fucking promise if this happens again, if I get a secondary cancer from treatment, or my original breast cancer returns - I AM FUCKING DONE!!!! I will not be doing this again.I'll ask my oncologist how much time I have left, if she says 2 years....I will say thank you I am going to smoke and drink and enjoy what time I have left, I refuse to get prodded and poked by doctors again!!! I am 32 years old, I don't wanna hear ""You are so young you have so much to live for blah blah blah"" - look I had my fill of life, I am tired of fighting every damn day not just cancer - but to fight at work just to provide for myself. My bucket list was short - I moved out of my parents house at 25 years old and I lost my virginity - I don't have anything else to want to ""try"". I am ready to go.  However I am not suicidal, but if death comes for me I will give him a big fucking hug!!!!!!

&#x200B;

I have grown very nihilistic - life is meaningless ""WORK WORK WORK WOOOOORK!!!! so you can buy shit, buy possessions, WORK FOR 40 more years....oh look now you die with your possessions that you can't take with you .... damn that was worth it. I promise you I will not be on my death bed thinking ""Man.....I wish I worked more and worked harder!!!!!!""

&#x200B;

I can't even enjoy beer or nicotine (via vaping) at this point, without lust what is the point of life? So please your guilt trip of ""I'm so young"" will not work on me.

&#x200B;

I don't want to hear ""Well you should be staying home because of CoRoNa!1!1!1!"" - bug off I am not giving up my daily routine, I refuse to be submissive to cancer or a little invisible ""bug"" if death comes for me so fucking being it!!! My vape pen is filled and is always on me, if I know I am on my way out I'm using the damn thing!

It was a rough journey. A tumor on his hypopharynx. Radiation that destroyed the tumor but also, his esophagus. For a year he was tube fed. He loved food, his career was food. That was the worst part. It came back in his neck and was inoperable so he tried a T-Cell treatment until side effects landed him in hospital. Then one hospital stay led to hospice. The neck tumor grew to a horrific size. The bandages had special chemicals to neutralize the smell as it leaked and bled. It pressed on nerves in his neck and caused horrible pain.

 In the end it was the esophageal stricture that finished him. Unable to swallow he grew too weak to cough and his lungs filled with fluid until he just couldn’t breathe. His lungs sounded full of water. 

He had panicked earlier in the evening that he would suffocate, but in his final hours he was calm. At one point I walked into the room  alone and he said he loved me. And he told me he would be gone in 10 minutes. He said this wasn’t right. Not like this. I agreed that it was unfair. I told him I loved him and we’d get him some sleep. An hour or so later he died. He was right.

In the end we were there telling him how loved he was, that it was ok, we would be ok, his partner would be ok. That he wasn’t alone.

I looked up and all of the staff were there, standing vigil. A call light went for another room and one wiped her eyes and left.

Tomorrow morning the dr will come and sign his death certificate. Tomorrow is today. 

Now we just, keep living, I guess? The deep gurgle of his drowning is playing over and over in my head. 

I love you dad. Thank you for letting us be there to say goodbye.

Moving Forward,100,acs9g1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/acs9g1/moving_forward/,23,1546704460.0,"My fiancé died December 14th at approximately 4:10 PM. He left behind the most beautiful sunset that I have ever and will ever have seen. I haven't had the courage to write about it until now because I'm positive that there are absolutely NO words to describe what I (and many others) have gone through the past few weeks. I've witnessed his last few, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds... I hear the rasping of his last breaths in my waking moments and dreams. I am eternally thankful that I was there to hold his hand until the end. I pray that he heard me tell him it is okay. That we (his family and I) are with him forever no matter where he goes. 

After he died, it was like a black comedy. His mother arrived and so did his younger brother, his two sisters in law, to talk to his still corpse. We all acted like it was okay (or as okay as it could be) and joked as much as we could while his body was still in the room (it took quite a while for someone ((the assigned nurse from hospice)) to pronounce him deceased). When the funeral people came, however, it was quite a different story. 

I was told by my fiance's older brother to not witness his body being lifted onto the stretcher and taken away because (bless these people) they would handle him as a body, as a job, which is not what I would have wanted to see at that time. So I listened and I spoke with the older brother's wife while I heard my finance's body being transferred and then carried out. I regret to his day that I didn't follow him but I'm not sure that I would have survived as I have if I had done so. 

His funeral services and reception were done that next Monday. His mother and father paid for everything with only the closest friends and family invited at the discretion of his family. His younger brother was responsible for the eulogy which had been cut down to 2 minutes during the formal ceremony and extended to 8 during the informal reception. We all smiled, laughed and cried in that order. 

Afterwards I moved from California to my hometown. My closest friends and family helped me pack and move my belongings in almost an entire day. I'm moving into an apartment within the next 7 days and I'll be reentering my previous job in the next 30 days. It's weird thinking that i'll be returning to how I was almost a year ago but without him. 

Every day I miss him. I miss the way he would slip from his work shoes into his sandals then head straight to the grill. The way he would sigh and then hug me close after a hard day at work. The way he would slip a hand around my shoulders and mutter something hilariously funny while he stoked the coals.

Even more, I miss the way that he would smile with his green-brown eyes and watch Jeopardy whenever it was on or force me to exit my social comfort zone to edge a little closer to his but, without that exuberance, I wouldn't have the support system I have now.

I am 32 years old, male, stage 2B invasive ductal carcinoma, non genetic - grade 2, ER+, HER2-

I had an inverted nipple for most of my life  (I would say atleast since mid teens, maybe since I was in early 20's I remember it a good portion of my life, just never put much focus on it )- thought it was normal and decided to get it checked out last year - I am ""happy"" I did, because it turned out to be cancer and it finally attacked a lymphnode.

November: 2019 - First Mammogram, ultrasound was done shortly after. They found a suspicious lump (not to me I've known about it for years just never got it checked out) - so they wanted to do a needle biopsy - which can be described as OW!!!!! (literally not enough novacane or whatever they use in the world to numb the area - felt like a wolf took a bite under my skin - they had to do it 3 times!!!)

&#x200B;

December 2nd, 2019 - get results - listed originally at the beginning of the post.  I get the call during work, busiest time of our year. I literally take the call while I am doing paperwork - once it dies down and I hang up the phone I tell my boss what I was told. Oddly enough I felt nothing, no grief, no anger just ""you got cancer"" It had the same inflection as ""the sky is blue"" or ""the sky is up"" .... yup sure is and water is wet. I was informed I should tell HR and did, I wasn't even aware what wild ride would happen over the next few months. I had no idea what was going to happen - I couldn't even comprehend it. I know surgery was mandatory, aside from that I knew nothing else. Sure watching TV shows you ""think"" you know, but shows like Breaking Bad are just over done for theatrics.

&#x200B;

Mid December - Followed by preop appointments, genetic testing, and physical therapy information. Along with meeting my surgeon and cancer team.

&#x200B;

January 9th - Mastectomy is finished followed by 2 weeks of recovery.

&#x200B;

February 13th - surgery for a chemo port is to be put in, followed by 4 sessions of chemo starting the next day. Dates are: Feb 14,  March 6th and 27th, April 17th

&#x200B;

May 11th - April 22nd - radiation Mon - Fri after work (feeling the affects now, chest is beat red, pealing, and burns when I move). Followed by an appointment with my radiation doctor right after my final appt. With oncologist as well telling me I need 5 years of temoxofin - with a surprise visit from my surgeon.....scheduling my port removal this weds.

&#x200B;

July 1st - MY CHEMO PORT IS REMOVED!!!

&#x200B;

July 8th - VACATION BEGINS THE MOMENT I CLOCK OUT OF WORK

&#x200B;

Sept I see my oncologist again.

&#x200B;

After 6 months of this madness I finally get my staycation!!! 2 weeks away from work and the fucking hospital. No more time is being stolen from me. No MORE: Surgeries, Chemo taking 4 hours of my life and the next day with it, Radiation EVERY DAMN DAY M-F......I get 2 weeks by myself doing exactly what I WANT!!!

&#x200B;

I will be selfish, I will not care at all about another human being, it will be ME, ME, ME!! IF I WANT TO DO SOMETHING I....WILL....FUCKING...DO...IT!!! If I want to eat a large pizza on the couch and drink beer while I binge watch New Girl, The Office (never seen it....seeing what the craze is about), or any show my heart desires - or a video game...I WILL DO IT!! If I want to read a book I will do it. I need this vacation I have had enough of this horse shit. FUCK YOU CANCER

I want to play Civ 6 on Diety

I'd love to binge watch tv shows I kept putting off.

Read the first book of GoT

I know boredom will settle in on day 6 roughly......but damn I will take it! If I just ""zone out"" for a bit because I ran out of stimuli then so be it....it will pass - I am tired of work and the fucking hospital stealing time from me.

&#x200B;

I know I wrote alot on the subject but I just had to vent. I know I will never get a true break from cancer, for the rest of my life I will need to be on the lookout....but damn 2 weeks of a ""die down"" is all worth it.",2020-06-27 07:12:15
Looking for hope,102,gxligx,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/gxligx/looking_for_hope/,31,1591452062.0,"Hi all, 

I’m 15 years old, and i was diagnosed with osteosarcoma in May of 2019. I did 18 rounds of chemo, a limb salvage surgery on my right leg and was given the all clear in February. I recently found out I have relapsed after only three months in remission. 

My oncologist gave us another treatment plan which will involve 6 cycles of a different kind of chemotherapy and surgery to remove the nodules in my lungs.

This time around I feel really scared and discouraged. I can do treatment again, i’ve done it before but I understand this time that the prognosis is much poorer especially with how fast i relapsed. I had so many things planned for my life after treatment, i’ve been getting stronger in physical therapy and this just feels so unfair, i’m scared for what my future holds and i want to be a long term survivor so badly but I honestly feel cautious to be optimistic with the numbers my oncologist gave me. 

I’m not really sure why i’m posting this, i’ve never posted before but i think i’m just looking for reasons to keep going and stay positive from others in this community even when the odds are against me

He was diagnosed with Stage 3 Pancreatic Cancer back in March, 2019. He had a whipple to remove most of it. He fought like hell. He was on the road to recovery and headed towards remission. The doctors declared that he would be cancer free by the end of his treatment. But out of nowhere, he got sicker and sicker. He lost over 90lbs. The cancer spread out of nowhere, and along with it, brought an internal infection that was anti-biotic resistant. There was nothing they could do. I’m just thankful that I got to drive down to SLC to say goodbye to him. I’m thankful that he was lucid enough for us to exchange our goodbyes. But watching him pass has been the most excruciating pain I’ve ever felt. For the longest time, we didn’t get along. My dad had the hardest time when I came out and married my husband. It was a long road of acceptance, but I’m happy that the last year, we finally got along as a father and son. The hardest words I’ve ever heard are “I’ll miss you son.

I wish I never got cancer,102,d1pdmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/d1pdmu/i_wish_i_never_got_cancer/,36,1568055814.0,"Jesus, man...Cancer is the worst thing on the planet. Just for some context, I’m 15M, and got cancer in elementary school. Chemo for only four months, which isn’t that bad compared to what other people go through, but it was still enough to mess me up. I’m currently in remission with about three years left until they can say I’m cancer free.

Anyways, cancer has given me nothing but grief. I’m now constantly worrying about my health, and any slight pain or sickness causes me to overreact and think it’s cancer. I’ve been having  random headaches behind my ear and I keep thinking it’s something bad, when in reality it isn’t. It’s also caused me anxiety, insecurity because people made fun of me, and now I physically cannot day the word cancer. It’s...It’s hard. 

I mean, I’m glad it happened to some degree, because I can share my story to inspire people and all that stuff. Life is gonna have its hardships, so why not look on the bright side...I just needed to vent because I feel silly talking to people in person about my health insecurities. Thanks for reading.

EDIT: Thank you so much everyone for the advice and kind words. I was having a very bad day, but I’m finishing it off very happy knowing that so many people would take the time out of their day to talk to me. I really appreciate it.

I never lost my hair and I've never been about to die. What I want to say is that chemotherapy is not all bad. There are some chemotherapies that do not make you feel constantly awful. I admit that most chemotherapies do that but some don't and it just bothers me whenever I see threads about how awful chemotherapy is. Some chemotherapies are not bad.

I really thought I was going to die in the hospital during that day. I was having fever hours after chemo and my blood pressure went down for the first time ever in my whole treatment experience. 
 
The next day, I had consistent shooting pain on and off from my left lung due to mets. I was screaming and crying from pain for 4 days and taking tramadol every 6 hrs. It had gotten me more depressed, scared and wishing I was better dead, asleep than enduring the pain and everything the chemo gives me. I laid on the bed for days, no appetite and told my Mom, ""Mom, I am ready to go. I think I just want to go than suffer, and make you all suffer."" It was around this time I have accepted that maybe, death isn't so tragic after all. Maybe sometimes it's the only way to ease or remove the suffering a person continuously feels. I have accepted that death is part of life, and I don't think I'll be afraid again if cancer permits me to go this way.

It had spread to his small intestines which led to a blockage, and a bypass surgery. Symptoms were apparent since December of 2017. He was not eating well and had abdominal pain once in a while. We thought it was just stress getting to him since his mother was ill. When his mother, my grandmother, passed away in Feb of 2018, he took a trip to ER due to abdominal pain. Again, we thought it was just part of grieving. Maybe, if we had taken him for a proper check-up. Maybe, if the doctor at ER had ordered a CT scan. Maybe, he might have had a chance. We could have had more time to prepare.


So for the last 6 months, he has had 2 rounds of the strongest chemotherapy which did more damage than good. After 5 rounds of the mildest chemotherapy, his body gave up. His bloodwork showed that chemo was working, but he just had no energy left in him. He spent most of his days sleeping, lost over 30 kgs, and couldn't handle the 30 min trip to the hospital anymore. 2 days ago, he got admitted to hospice because doctors don't see more than a couple months left. I promised him I would take him to Okanagan for stargazing and camping. I promised him a trip to Seattle to watch a baseball game. Everything he wanted, or I wanted, seems impossible now. For my graduation, my wedding, the birth of his grandchildren, and the rest of my mother's life, he will not be there. All I will be able to do is go to his memorial, put down flowers, and cry. 


Dad, 

Thank you for all you have done for me. If we meet again as a family, I will make sure your happiness comes first before mine. Let's make sure we are even next time. It was great 23 years of knowing you. Your body may be gone, but I know that you will always be with me for the rest of my life and my mother's life. And don't worry about mom, you know she's a strong woman. I know how good of a husband you were to her. I will try my best to fill your empty space. And please say hi to grandmother. Tell her I am sorry I couldn't visit her more often and that I miss her so much. I know you missed her too. She might be pretty pissed that you found her too soon, but let her know my mother and I are gonna be fine. 


By the way, I'm going to a cemetery tomorrow to pick out a spot for you to rest. I hope you don't mind whatever I pick. 


Good night,

The world got upside down,97,cmaj3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/cmaj3t/the_world_got_upside_down/,8,1565037931.0,"Sorry if this becomes longer, I'm not even sure how to begin this.

When I was 16yo, my little sister died (within 3 weeks from diagnosis) of cancer when she was 11. Six month later, my mother (38y) died also of cancer (within 3 months). A few years later, my uncle and grandma died of the same illness, too. After my sister and mom died, I had a genetic test done because university hospital lab technicians found it striking that two of my first-degree blood relatives died of this disease in such a short time. It turned out that I have a genetic defect in the tp-53 gene and that the risk of developing cancer is very high. Nobody seemed to be able to help me with that and there were no contact points for me either. I had the diagnosis and was on my own with it.

At first, every time I had pain anywhere, I had panic attacks, but it went better with every months passing by. I learned to live with the knowledge that one day I'd get cancer. It was never a question of IF, but of WHEN. I tried to prepare myself for the time when sh\*t would hit the fan and I thought I was doing okay. I gave my documents to every docter I went, but they knew nothing and everyone of them underestimated it. I had thoughts about family planning, I discussed it with my SO, but in the end I wasn't sure if I wanted kids. The risk of passing that genetic defect on to my children and watching them die was too much a risk for me. I didn't want to burden my SO with him watching his children die, it would be enough if he had to go through it with me one day.

As the years passed my hope of getting old (like my grandma, she was 76) grew. I felt safe and everything was just like a bad dream of the past. And then, 2019 happened. In April, I found a lump in my chest, and two weeks ago, I got diagnosed with breastcancer. I had a ton of examinations, from punches to bone scan to MRT and I still need some diagnoses because the doctors have a hunch that the cancer has spread into the lungs and the spine.

I realised that (almost) all my mental preparations where useless. I am so scared and I don't know what to do. I try to live a ""normal"" life as long as possible, but everything has a bitter aftertaste. Every morning I wake up feeling like I've ended up in a nightmare and the treatments haven't even started yet. I'm 34 years old and I don't know if I should dare to dream about my life after cancer. Why does life have to be so unfair?

I had a set back last week. Last Sunday night I woke up in the middle of the night and could not move my legs. At all. Quite paralyzed. 

I ended up in the hospital from Sunday night into Thursday afternoon. Fluid built up on my brain due to swelling. But, it took them forever to come to that conclusion. There was a chance that it was meningitis which scared everybody. So, I was locked down for a number of days while results, slowly, came back.

As it turns out swelling caused a build up of cerebral fluid which caused a few problems.
This whole episode has delayed chemo which needs to get started, but I need to be healthy ish first.

So this is where I am. Astrocytoma has turned to glioblastoma from which there is no cure. I would love to say I'm at peace. I would love to say this is easy. I would love to have more time. But, I'll take all I can.

One perspective on stopping treatment as a young person,98,ezm8og,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/ezm8og/one_perspective_on_stopping_treatment_as_a_young/,28,1580989442.0,"I just finished the final season of the Good Place. And I really recommend it as a funny, light-hearted show that's wholly cynical and yet at the same time so optimistic about humanity. I really recommend it for that reason alone, but the final season also made me feel more accepting of my fate. Of my death. Because I'm terminal, and I've been terminal for over a year, and for the first time in my life I feel like I can accept that. And I want to talk about my choice to stop treatment. 

I am a young person. I was diagnosed at 23 and I was diagnosed late, I was stage four when they found it and their optimistic guess was ten more years with treatment. I tried some treatment, chemo before surgery, and the sort of chemo that didn't make my hair fall out so life could continue on like it had with little disturbance. But the chemo didn't work and my cancer was aggressive. And my doctor said that there was no right answer, only the answer that is right for you. 

I chose not to do the harsh chemo because I didn't want to suffer before I died. The probability of it actually working (extremely low chance) played into it but honestly I saw it as two choices; dying by the ocean, or dying on the mountain. No wrong answer and either way you're still choosing death. But you get to decide how you die. And I knew I didn't want to suffer with my hair gone and unable to have the good life I so previously enjoyed. I knew I'd hate it. I didn't see the point. 

It's been a year since I made that choice. And truthfully its been a good year. A few ups and downs with symptoms but meds have sorted it and I still live largely as I did when I was completely healthy. I travel, I see people, I mostly play a lot of video games and read and spend time with my family. It is actually a lot like the Good Place in a lot of ways, no real responsibilities. Summer holidays 24/7. And I think that I have made the right choice for me. But I still have mixed feelings sometimes. Because... who can be content with dying? I think we're doing a disservice when the only dying people we see in movies are either the old, who are sad to go but peaceful with their long life lived well, and the young who die in a dramatic act of self-sacrifice in some kind of war. I think the reality is a lot more complicated. I'm not sure if accepting death is always realistic for young people facing the end.

If I wasn't hurting my family, I could find peace with leaving. But I am, so it's hard, and I do feel guilt for not doing the whole rage against the dying light thing. But at the same time, I know I'd hate it, and I enjoy my time now, and while I can't dismiss my fear of death and I know I'll be sad and scared when the time eventually comes, I do think I'm making the right choice to stretch my 'good time' for as long as possible. The illness touches as little as my life as possible. I get as much as my good life as I can grab. My point is that, if you are a person who chooses to stop treatment, you might not be wholly content with your fate. But you have two choices laid out in front of you and you think you know which one you'd prefer. To tell the truth, I do still um and err over my decision on some late nights. Because I don't want to die. I want to find a way to not die. But I don't think that's in the cards for me. So I made my choice, and I chose to die after living like I'm in the Good Place for a little bit. 

I don't want this post to make anyone feel like they shouldn't be doing something if that something is what they feel is right for them. But I would like to open up a little about my choice, because I rarely see it talked about, and I would like to let people know that I don't think anyone stops being afraid of dying.",2020-02-06 11:44:02

The cancer came back May 2017 in my abdominal lymph nodes. I had surgery then more chemo and radiation but it was unsuccessful. I found that out in February 2018. My doctor actually told me that I had 6 months or less to live, that I should go home and get ready. As a last Hail Mary they tested my tumor for a specific protein that immunotherapy could help. I was a GREAT candidate, so I decided to go on that route. I started on Keytruda (an immunotherapy) in April 2018 and have been on it ever since. My initial CT showed that 3 of 4 tumors were gone and that there was a mass but it hadn’t grown at all. My doctor told me he suspected that it wasn’t even live cancer tissue and that, although we’d need a PET scan to be sure, I may very well be in remission again. I found that out in December 2018 and it was truly a Christmas miracle.  

Well, I just had my PET scan last week and got the results today. There’s a new tumor in yet another abdominal lymph node that, while still small, seems to be growing despite the regular doses of Keytruda. My doctor said that there’s nothing to do at the moment. We’ll just have another scan in a couple of months and see. He also told me that we knew the treatment was working but it was never guaranteed for how long. He actually called the report “a mixed bag” because my prior tumors have all disappeared. But this new one is small, 1.8 cm x 1.1 cm. I don’t know how to feel really. I’m disappointed but I don’t want to let on that I’m scared. My fiancé and my family have all been really supportive through everything, and we all had finally gotten used to the good news that I wasn’t going to die any time soon. But now this.

I married my wife in October 2013.  We got together in early 2012.  I’ve known her since freshman high school. She is 32.  I am 31.  It’s unfortunate that we did not get together sooner.  In 2014-15 we notice she had urine issues and back pain and leg pain.  The doctors we were seeing thought it was just sciatica or kidney stones.  

In June of 2016 she goes into kidney failure. The doctors state something is very wrong and not normal. When he went in for surgery the urologist notice something “not normal” (cervical tumor pushing on her ureters) kidney stints get installed.  He gives us recommendations for an oncologists. We go and after the biopsy our worst fear became reality.  Stage 4 cervical cancer.  

3 months (I don’t remember how long) of radiation and taxol chemo goes on.  Doctor thinks this should take care of everything and get a check up after 3 months.  (Worst decision imho) we go in for check up and bad news and good news.  

The cervical tumor got smaller.  Bad news.  Something bad along the way and it went into lymph nodes in her neck and sternum.  Chemo continues on but with different kind of chemo( not taxol) and pretty much continues till Novemberish or so.  Each pet scan/ct scan was never great. Best case was tumor never got bigger or smaller.  Doctor said “in the medical world, that is a great sign.” And chemo should continue on.   Waiting on insurance to approve another round. 

(Chemo hasn’t started.)
After thanksgiving my wife starts throwing up and having serious nausea.  Zofran(spelling) is not helping. She can’t keep down her meds.  She gets admitted to the hospital.  They find out she has an obstruction in her colon( pretty much tumor is blocking things) 

She gets let out of the hospital after maybe 2 weeks.  She stays in my apartment. She’s doing fine for a couple days. She calls me up saying she has been having trouble breathing because so much vomit etc. I take her back to the hospital.  (This is either after christmas or not. But she did get to celebrate Christmas with us)

It’s confirmed she has pneumonia.  She is there for another couple weeks to make sure nothing goes bad. We are making preparations to see doctor for more pet scans.  It’s been almost 2 months of no chemo treatment due to being in and out of hospital.   Results show everything grew and now things have gone to her lungs and spine. Oncologist says no reason to continue.  She is now terminal.  Plans for hospice care is in the work. 

It’s January. Hospice care is going on. Somewhere along the way while she was in the hospital the doctor decides a gastrointestinal tube should be done.  To relieve her of nausea. Tho she is limited to liquids.  This was the best out of her 4 options given to her. And it became the best.  She has never had any nausea since.  

She has been staying at her parents house. Her parents are retired and have been taking great care of her. The hospice company has been great.  

A month ago we notice she can no longer stand/walk or move her legs. To go to the restroom.  We don’t know if this apart of atrophy or something related to cancer. Regardless we have to now fully take care of her.  We have to change her and clean her and do everything. 

A week ago. Hospice recommends 24 hour care. During this time her mental status has been so altered from the morphine it’s like she isn’t the same.  Last Friday starts where she is in respiratory distress. Having high rate of breathing and a huge drop in blood pressure. On call nurse stabilize her thru more meds to calm her and up get portable o2 thru nasal cannula to 5.  (Was 4 with a huge tube length- now shorter )

Now she’s been having Cheyen stokes breathing since Friday.  I overheard the nurse. Use the term “terminal breathing”

It’s very hard to see. She’s pretty much in a comatose state. No response at all.  

I’m lost for words.   Thank you for reading. Good luck to the rest of you all. Prayers all around.  And
Fuck cancer.

She had a round of chemo + radiation and things were looking up, but instead of ‘melting’ the tumor just flattened and dried out, it was sort of dormant. As soon as the treatment was over it started growing again. 

In the last two months she started a ew therapy, but whatever they are trying the tumor is taking as sustenance and at this point is growing insanely fast. It went from the size of a tangerine to going up, pressing the kidneys, pushing her stomach and back.  Last week she was admitted to the hospital again and a nephrostomy on both kidneys was performed.

Cut to last night, when the doctors are officially giving up. She will be sent home soon, to spend her final days with her 20, 17 and 2 year old girls and husband. I will stay with her until she decides is time. I just hope it’s not too painful.

I recently went to my surgeons to discuss the surgery that will follow my treatments. I had assumed that my colon and rectum will be removed because of the FAP. However the surgeons have recommended that I have my prostate, my bladder, my colon, my rectum, the bottom five bones of my spine, and the muscle and bone on the inside of my pelvis on the right side. This is all because they can’t get a clearly delimited line between the tumor (at its largest, I have not had my final scans yet following radiotherapy) and my prostate and between the tumor and the pelvis. 

This would leave me in intensive care for 3 weeks follow surgery, having to be shifted from lying in my left or right side as to close the wound they create in the surgery they would have to steal muscle and skin from somewhere else on my ass. I would be unable to lie on my back, or sit and have to re learn how to walk (having read testimonials of people who had the same surgery it seems I will never walk properly again let alone gym. I used to be a pretty solid athlete before getting sick). 

I would also need a bag for urine ( I already have a ileostomy bag) and would be completely impotent for life and likely unable to climax either. 

If I don t get the surgery my doctor said I will likely get remission and die in three to five years. 

I do not want to die but also the life that would follow the surgery doesn’t seem like life. My life before was at least two hours of exercise a day. And also I don’t think I would expect my partner to stay with me if I can’t have any real sex life.

Biologically speaking, that is a fact. 

I will leave those specifics for the scientists and medical professionals to contemplate.

It is asking ""why us?"" over and over again. 

It's endless trips to the hospital and scrounging for toonies to feed the parking meter.

It's panic attacks while waiting for test results.

It's wondering if there will be a next Christmas. 

It's a crisis of faith. 

It’s being utterly powerless. 

It’s getting sick wiping up a chemo spill and wondering how he can tolerate multiple, full doses (straight to the heart) with such strength and poise. 

It’s trying to feed someone who can’t eat because food is the only medicine you know how to prepare and maybe the only language you have in common.

It's grieving too soon and then feeling guilty for your numbness. 

It's paperwork and planning for a future that seems so very small. 

It's your mother wondering how she can possibly live without her high school sweetheart.

It's not knowing what to say. 

It's feeling guilty because you're bad at knowing what to say. 

It’s asking your own dad which casket he prefers. 

It's disbelief. 

It’s laboured breathing.

It’s the shock and paralysis when you’re asked if you’d like to void a DNR. 

It's waiting for someone to come home who never will. 

It's going to ask someone a question who isn't there and then punishing yourself for your own forgetfulness.

It's waking up and then remembering. 

It's feeling guilty when you try to forget.

It's having the memory of your father's face usurped by the image of some emaciated skeleton.

It's remembering two jaundiced eyes so yellow that you didn’t recognize them. 

It's the realization that those eyes didn’t recognize you.

It’s skin like tissue paper that you were too afraid to touch, hug, or kiss. 

It's a house filled with flowers and cards and people, but one that feels infinitely more empty. 

It's demanding answers and getting nothing back. 

It's being so angry and not knowing where to direct that anger. 

Fuck cancer. 

Fuck you.",2018-05-09 13:32:41
My dad passed away tonight.,98,hs528i,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/hs528i/my_dad_passed_away_tonight/,27,1594912043.0," My outstanding 61 year old father had stage 4 colon cancer for two and a half years. It spread to his peritoneal lining which doctors kept telling us is harder to treat than if it were on a vital organ. We all kept positive throughout that time. My dad especially. He’s a tough as nails USMC vet who never complained, never gave up and always gave us so much love. Endless love. It doesn’t feel real. Me and my mom were lucky enough to be there with him and hold his hands, telling him how much we love him and that we’ll be okay without him. I kept crying on and off. He originally went to the ER yesterday for a bowel obstruction, uncontrollably committing the entire night and day. Then the palliative care doctor called me around 3 PM. It happened so fast. He had an oxygen mask on and wasn’t receiving fluids since it was filling up his lungs and his heart wasn’t responding well to it. I knew he hated the mask. I asked him to confirm if he wanted hospice care, he nodded his head. He knew it was the end. I did too. My mom was more in shock, in denial of it. As soon as they removed the oxygen mask and put an oxygen tube through his nose (cannula I think,) his breathing immediately shortened and shallowed. He couldn’t breathe on his own. They gave him morphine, so he wasn’t in any pain. The sweet nurse offered him a Coke, but he was too weak. The palliative care doctor was very kind to my family and my dad as well, which I’m so appreciative of. My mom held his hand the entire time while praying with him. Then my dad suddenly stopped breathing. I know people always say “it happened so fast,” but it’s taken me enduring this to realize it’s true. Time wasn’t real in the hospital. They were supposed to move him to an upper floor, but we stayed with him in the dark ER room. When I realized how quickly he stopped breathing, I panicked and ran outside to the nurse station just shouting that my dad stopped breathing. Three of them came inside and immediacy began doing CPR, and my mom started bawling. I’ve never ever seen my mom cry like that before. My sadness turned into shock, and I wrapped my arms around my mom to comfort her while she sobbed. She was staring the whole time as they were trying to revive him. I told her to look away if it was too hard. I was crying a little bit, but knew I needed to comfort her. I’m still shocked. I went through his cellphone and found old videos and pictures of me and him. They made me breakdown. It dawned on me that I’ll never get a text from him again. Never go to the grocery store with him again. Never get advice from him again. Never hear his dark, yet endearing marine humor again. It feels like I’m not living my own life. I’m going through the motions. I’m scared of the future. I’m 20 years old, barely about to begin college this fall. My brother is only 15. My boyfriend is also in the Marine Corp, and only got to meet my dad once last year. It’s all so confusing and I feel lost and broken. I know with time me and my family will be okay again. But a part of me has died with my dad. The only thing that gives me peace is knowing he wasn’t in pain when he went, and that he’s no longer suffering but whole again in the kingdom of heaven. If anyone out there is going through something similar, or if you’re blessed enough to have your loved one still alive and breathing, please be with them. Take pictures of them and with them. Take videos. Record their voice. Tell them you love them. Life can be cruel and short for some. I never thought I wouldn’t have my dad around at 20 years old. I’m his girl. He taught me so much and loved me so much and I’ll strive everyday to be the kind of person he’d be proud of. I’m sorry if this post is all over the place. My brain is hazy right now. Sending my love out there to everyone being affected by this ugly, unfair disease. May we all find peace in our hearts.",2020-07-16 15:07:23

My journey,95,ekfaus,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/ekfaus/my_journey/,11,1578271146.0,"Late summer of 2019, shortly before my 19th birthday, I noticed a lump on my neck.  I've had a swollen lymph node before, so I wasn't too worried.  About a month after it appeared, it grew.  By the time my stubborn self went to the urgent care, it was the size of a softball.  The folks at the urgent care said they didnt think it was cancer, so they put me on a week long dosage of Prednisone and did some blood work before they passed me on to my primary care, who then passed me to Dr. Ranjit Joseph, the lead hematologist at UNC Rex cancer center.  He immediately began scheduling scans, xrays, and biopsies, and I was diagnosed with Stage 4 Classical Hodgkin's Lymphoma.  I remember my father crying on the phone with my sister trying to explain what was happening.  I had aggressive activity in my neck (where it began), around my lungs, around my spleen, and around my bones in my pelvis and hip.  We immediately began treatment with Adriamycin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine, and Dacarbazine.  After 4 treatments, another PET scan was performed and it showed everything was gone except for a small amount in my neck.  This was the first positive news we had received in months.  I'm set to finish chemo on March 9th.  I'm so close to the end, but I still feel so far away and I'm terrified it will return.  In all honesty, the cancer has been tough, but I've begun living my life like I never have before.  I spend more time with friends, I'm planning a vacation in the summer of 2020 to New York, and, all in all, I've started having fun.  Maybe it's just me, but it seems like my diagnosis has had a positive impact on my lifestyle, more than anything else that has happened.",2020-01-06 00:39:06

How do I help my family watch me die?,97,8jzagd,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/8jzagd/how_do_i_help_my_family_watch_me_die/,42,1526540018.0,"I'm 36 years old, mother to a beautiful 5-month-old baby girl, loving wife of nearly 12 years to my amazing husband and soulmate, and I've just recently been diagnosed with colon cancer that has spread everywhere. And I do mean everywhere: my brain, spine, lungs, ovaries, liver...there's nowhere it hasn't touched.  The only symptoms I had were a slightly sore back and narrower stool. There's nothing the doctors can do, and I have only weeks or days to live. 

Somehow I've been coping semi-okay...at times feeling something like a peace that passes all understanding (though also at times feeling futile anger and sometimes even hope that I'll be miraculously healed, even though I know it's not rational). I've written letters goodbye to my loved ones, made arrangements for after I'm gone, and in general feel ""okay"" about what will happen after my death (despite feeling immense and inexpressible sadness that I won't be there to watch my beautiful baby girl and my amazing nephew grow up and to take care of my husband and family. But that's not the plan for my life, so I have to accept it and move on.)

What I'm having a REALLY hard time with is how my parents and husband and sister will handle my actual dying part. I know that once I'm gone it will be terribly difficult for them (we're all such a close-knit family), but I won't be around to help them deal with that, and just have to trust that God and family and friends will see them through. What I will be around for (presumbly, if I'm not completely unconscious) is watching them deal with my actual death process. My wonderful mom was a nurse for 41 years and my mother-in-law is also a retired nurse, and they want to take care of me as I die at home with the help of hospice. My mom has seen MANY people die in her line of work, but I know that watching her own daughter go through the process will be immeasurably more difficult. And of course my darling husband will take it extremely hard too. :( 

Is there anything I can do to make this whole dying process easier on them? I've read about the things that hospice provides and the care that's required at the end-of-life, and it's terrifying. Oh how I wish I could just pass away peacefully tonight in my sleep!!! Why can't euthanasia be a legal option? I'd so much rather take it than allow my loved ones to suffer needlessly, with no hope. I'm sorry this post is so negative. I don't want my last thoughts and actions on this earth to be that way. But it's unbelievable and incredibly ironic that just five months ago my mom, mother-in-law, and husband were in the delivery room with me while I was in pain waiting for my gorgeous daughter to be born. Now they will have to watch me die, and will get no bundle of joy out of the deal--only a dead daughter and a dead wife. I just wish that I could somehow spare them this. ",2018-05-17 06:53:38
2020 destroyed my family (vent),94,jaeb77,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/jaeb77/2020_destroyed_my_family_vent/,16,1602627470.0,"I live in the US with my husband and my parents lived in Brazil. Back in the beginning of July my dad fell ill with what we thought was covid-19. He had all the symptoms and ended up going to the hospital on July 11th. I was on a video call with him trying to calm him down until the paramedics arrived. He couldn’t breathe, It was the most terrifying thing I’ve ever seen in my life. He made a joke as he was leaving and I said “I love you”. I had a panic attack as soon as he was taken by the paramedics. July 16th I landed in Brazil to support my mom(71yo) and wait for my Dad(68) to come out of the hospital. 

While he was at the hospital I took my mother to a Pulmonologist to investigate her breathing, her family doctor suspected she had COPD. 
July 31st my Dad passed away from sepsis after a failed attempt to drain a large abscess in his liver that wasn’t discovered in time, because the doctors thought it was something viral.

3 days after my dad’s death we had an appointment to check my mom’s results. Turns out she had a large tumor in her lung that had already metastasized and also Lymphangitis. Her diagnosis is stage IV squamous lung carcinoma. I’m watching my mom suffer everyday. 

I couldn’t allow myself to mourn my Dad so my mom wouldn’t worry about me. She is the kind of mom that worries more about my afflictions than her own. Now I need to be even stronger not to fall apart because I am her only caregiver.

I am so numb, I cry sometimes but I just feel this dark pit inside of me.People try to talk to me. Ask how I’m doing... I don’t know.. I just lost my dad, he was the best person ever, I couldn’t hug him or say goodbye in person, now I am here watching my mom struggle to breathe, asking God to kill her soon so she doesn’t suffer. I feel powerless, horrible, depressed.

My mom always said that dying without being able to breathe was the most terrifying thing for her, probably the worst way to go after being burned alive. 
And that is exactly what is happening to her. She is terrified. 

She did her first chemotherapy treatment this week and she came out worse than she was going in. 
She doesn’t know what to do. If she should continue the treatment and feel this way with a slim hope of the tumor shrinking or just medicate the pain and wait for her to go.

I don’t know what to say...
I wish the treatment would work, but I don’t know if it will. So I’m afraid of saying she should do it.
But at the same time I’m afraid of telling her not to and missing out a chance to feel a little better.


My father-in-law passed away last year of Lung cancer as well, and before he passed he said if he could go back in time, he wouldn’t have done chemo.
He suffered so much... I’m lost.

I have tried to be a good lil redditor and be there for people and answer questions to the best of my ability. 

I've been fighting cancer nearly a year now (Low Rectal Adenocarcinoma T3 N1 M1) and I can for the very first time come here with good news.

I don't know why I got to be so lucky, but I just got my scan results back after completing 28 sessions of chemo-radiotherapy and my primary tumour, the bowel lymph, bowel wall and systemic cancer in my right seminal vesicle is gone.  
It cannot be seen on my MRI or CT scans at all. Gone... Nada!  


It is bitter sweet though, my lung mets have shown a ""small, but significant increase"" bringing the total number of mets to 5 from 1.5 from the previous rounds of Irinotecan (5FU) chemotherapy late last year.

So after putting the phone down to my oncologist, I am going back on 5FU with Irinotecan again and this time I am on Avastin. It should be starting in the next 5-6 days. I am currently on Cloud 9, both me and my finacée are just over the moon. It's just not sunk in yet.

I also want to say that while this sub can be full of heartbreaking stories, not every cancer story ends badly.

194 days ago my son who is 5 (4 at diagnosis) was diagnosed with Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma. This was after we saw a lump that swelled his right eye. We were supposed to have Christmas on that day (26th/Boxing Day in the UK) as my wife had spent most of Christmas Day in hospital herself (Braxton Hicks pains with her pregnancy).

The diagnosis first came in as a brain tumor, likely neuroblastoma which thankfully wasn't the case. Further tests showed it was NHL and was 'brain adjacent', inside the skull and against the brain but not in the brain. This was good news, which led to the bizarre conversation about ""if you had to have a cancer, NHL is the cancer to have"". That is still a strange sentence to say but it's quite true, apparently it's a low comeback rate and a high cure rate, the two things you want the most.

We are now about 6 months or so after that conversation, we have had back to back hard going chemo that caused some horrible side effects and we have been around people whose journeys didn't end as we would have hoped, but we are here now. Today was the end of treatment meeting with the oncologists. We are now officially no longer under treatment and are showing no evidence of disease. The doc didn't really like the words 'in remission' (to him it's just the same as NED) but they fit well here.

We have a lovely 5 year old who is ready to take on the world again. His strength and mobility returns day after day and soon the only reminders of this episode will be a few small scars on his chest from the now removed portcath.

We realise that the paranoia will be there and understand that there is still a journey ahead of us, but to be told we are no longer under treatment was the best delayed Christmas present a dad could ask for.

Now we can look to the future for the first time in ages and I can't wait to see where we go from here.

To those reading this who are not yet at the end of their journey, or who have had this come back, I hope this doesn't discourage or upset you. I hope that the people reading this take happiness in the fact that this can be beaten, that somewhere out there in the real world a little 5 year old can be at home with mum, dad and his two little sisters (the youngest of which was born 1 week after diagnosis - mums water broke while on the ward!).

Does anyone have experience with Gabapentin or Calcitonin (They want to start Calcitonin to strengthen his bones, Gabapentin for pain management- although he refuses to even take Tylenol for pain.) I’ve researched some already, just interested in real world experiences with either of these meds.

I will stick around this subreddit and offer whatever support I can to people that are facing something similar.
Mom was an amazing woman; I'm sure a lot of you would have loved to know her.  Funny, compassionate, warm and caring....and a nurse!  How lucky my family was.
This hurts so much.

"My fight may end soon, so I'd like to share the best and the worst of my time with you.",92,3ss4e0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/3ss4e0/my_fight_may_end_soon_so_id_like_to_share_the/,64,1447538533.0,"After a few weeks of weird things happening to my body, my mum decided to take me into the city to get as many scans as she possibly could. The fourth day of my first week of school. As if it couldn't get worse, I was sitting in maths as she texted me my results: Diffuse Astrocytoma. Grade II brain cancer. To say the least I was terrified. This was my last year of school, the best year anyone could possibly have as a teenager and mine was about to be ripped away by a foreign tumour residing in my brain. What followed were many hours spent at my local hospital with a high number of hours of talking to various doctors. My life from then on was a balance of school and hospital.

The first term of school was definitely memorable. I'd gone on a school camp and developed an interesting relationship with one of the boys in my class. He'd sparked new feelings in me that at that point in time I didn't believe I could feel. He made me feel butterflies, good butterflies. Even though everything but that was going downhill my school work had always been the most important thing to me and not once did I let that priority slip. I was getting consistent grades and everyone close to me was proud. 

Second term was a bit of a blur as I was hardly at school, I was drained by what was going on in my body. I didn't see many people and I felt very depressed. 

By term three I had started chemo and my newly titled boyfriend attended as many four hour long sessions as he possibly could. We would sit together on the chair and play super smash bros against one another. I always beat him and I believed that he wasn't letting me. Things became complicated with us as his parents told him that I was a toxin in his life, if he became too attached to me he was likely to plummet once I was gone. They forbid him from talking to me and so began the slow descent on the one thing that made me happy. During that time there were some lovely things happening though. My mother had gotten a new job that she is currently enjoying immensely, my friends made a special speech for me at our awards night (which made me cry very hard and I was a mess when I received two academic awards), and I'd been on a trip to Brisbane with a class of kids from my grade. We had an amazing time together, getting to know one another. But it was on that trip that I had found out my grade II had progressed quickly to grade IV. When I arrived home my mother was a mess. After a few more processes of chemo we were forced to shave my head and it became extremely easy to style in the morning. Between then and now there have been many highs and many lows. 

Last night, was my year 12 formal (http://imgur.com/gBR2xg5). It was the best night of my life so far and I just felt like a normal teenager again, dancing and singing with all my friends. I felt beautiful, something I hadn't felt since February. And now with only a week left of school I'm starting to realise the importance of time. A few weeks ago I was told I only had until after Christmas to live and well, I'm not really prepared to be gone. I still have so much I want to do but I won't ever get to do those things. Like travel to Europe, be a mother or even an auntie, be a godmother to my friend's children, or see my brother graduate and grow up to be the loveliest man in the world. These things are becoming a reality to me now and I'd like to make sure everyone understands just how precious your time here is. 

My journey has been draining and sad but not once did I forget that I was still on this earth and I had to live my life. My friends and family have tried very hard to keep me smiling throughout the year and I'm so grateful for them. Please don't forget to just stop every now and then and think about what you're doing. Remember that you're on this planet for a reason. Live it, enjoy it.",2015-11-14 22:02:13

After the appointment, I went into the pedestrian zone because I needed something from a store. I was wearing my face mask  because of my bad blood levels (my latest chemo-session was just a week beforehand), and stood in front of the store, minding my own business, when a girl (she was around 15y old) stood beside me and coughed in my direction. I was shocked and went a few steps away, as she returned to her group of friends, laughing and thinking it was a great joke. 

Normally, I wouldn't have said anything. But her laughing made me angry, so I decided to face her.  I told her, in a calm tone, that not all mask-wearing people are just scared for COVID-19. I told her that I have cancer and bad blood levels, and how rude her behaviour was, but I guess she didn't listen to me. She got insolent and defensive before she left, as if I was the bad person for pointing out her wrongdoing. 

I don't know why, but this incident still affects me. Why are some people so stupid? Her age is no excuse in this matter, she is - theoretically speaking - old enough to know that there are serious reasons why someone is wearing a face mask. Today, I still have no signs for a flu or a fever, hence I can assume that she really just faked that coughing, so there is no harm done. But oh boy I am still mad at that brat.",2020-03-09 19:24:17

My sister is my person,91,bhfekl,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/bhfekl/my_sister_is_my_person/,22,1556263551.0,"My sister has been battling breast cancer for almost 2 years now. We started at a smaller hospital that initially diagnosed her with stage 3 triple negative breast cancer. They told us it was aggressive but they’d cure it. After rounds of chemo, then a mastectomy, then radiation, the cancer metastasized to her brain. We were now at stage 4. 

We switched to a more renowned hospital. More chemo. More radiation. Gamma knife. All of it. We had zero doubts in our mind, as rough as the road got, she’d be a breast cancer survivor. She’d be one of the 22% of women and men who survive stage 4 breast cancer. 

Monday, the doctor told us the the cancer had spread beyond the liver, the bones, the brain and wherever else it had spread to in the past 2 years, to the spinal and brain fluid. 

Leptomeningeal metastasis. Whatever the hell that is. Before this, her oncologist had lots of different options for us. But this.....this is it. The doctor who had kept our hope alive told us that it’s time to transition to hospice. Once diagnosed, you basically have 4-6 weeks to live. It is only seen in 3-5% of all cancer cases and it happened to our survivor. 

My sister is the smartest person I’ve ever known. She had just finished year 1 at a top 10 law school on a full ride scholarship when she was diagnosed. I remember the pride (and slight disappointment lol) I felt when she said Duke Law accepted her and offered her money but that wasn’t the school for her. I remember the pride I felt when after months of chemo treatments, she went to interview with some of the best firms in the world for a summer internship. I celebrated her wins and callbacks with her. I scoffed at the firms that just weren’t good enough with her. 

She graduated top of her class in undergrad. She would mostly likely be a lawyer for a top firm or somebody incredibly important......now she can’t tell me where she is. She confuses basic words or makes up new words. She can’t get her thoughts across. She’s in a state of delirium (another new word for me). 

My sister is my hero. I try so hard not to cry when I play along with her hallucinations. I can’t help myself from crying when I see my parents who were so incredibly proud of my sister and all of her accomplishments watch their child’s life come to an end in the most painful way possible. 

When she’s lucid, she tells me how scared she is and how she’s not ready to give up fighting. We were supposed to live long, successful lives. There is no more fight. I’ve spent hours looking up clinical trials. There are 11 recruiting right now for leptomeningeal mets and most of them exclude her for one reason or another. 

Whether anyone reads this or not, I just needed to get my thoughts out there. I talk to no one about this. Most people in my life have no idea what’s going on except for family. I don’t know how I’m going to listen to people talk about their siblings when I’m losing mine. How parents can talk about their children knowing my parents watched theirs deteriorate in the worst way. 

My sister is my person. I don’t know what’s next and I’m too scared to find out.",2019-04-26 07:25:51
A Stepping Stone in the Grieving Process,93,b0ayux,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/b0ayux/a_stepping_stone_in_the_grieving_process/,20,1552442931.0,"Hello everyone-

Mom passed last June from Liver and Bile Duct Cancer and many of you in this group have helped me through this experience.  I thought I'd share something that happened to me today on the way to work that brought me some peace.

I've spent a lot of time crying because mom had to leave, and witnessing how quickly her health diminished each time I traveled down to see her was excruciating.  Having good friends and an excellent partner in life has been very helpful.  I even saw a therapist for a while, but of course, the pain continued.

It wasn't until today that on my way to work I had a random memory of hitting a home run in little league decades ago, and mom whistled the way only she could-- and then yelled out ""yay, Dave!!""  She made me a special dinner that night.  

Before I parked my car at work a big smile came across my face because SHE was my  mom....and that made me feel so lucky.  It was the first memory I've had since she left that brought me a smile.  I think that's a small stepping stone in the grieving process.

To those of you going through this with a loved one, things will get better.  Grief is a long process and you just have to let it happen.  One day you'll have a fond memory come to you and the happy will perhaps outweigh the sad; even for just a moment.

I hope that helps.

My mom passed away on Friday.

It had been undiagnosed for a few months and was too aggressive to treat, so we opted to pursue hospice care instead.

I had to fly from another coast to see her before she passed. By then she could no longer speak and only occasionally opened her eyes, as if to acknowledge that she knew we were with her. She looked older and more mortal than I'd ever seen her.

Then, just two days later, she was gone. Two weeks after her diagnosis, she was gone - just like that.

It happened too fast to even comprehend that my mom had just died at 60. I kept myself busy by planning a memorial ceremony for the weekend and talking to relatives I hadn't seen in years. I felt useful again; I could forget about the powerlessness and the death and the gaping hole where my mother had been.

Being surrounded by people gave me a purpose - a reason to focus on something or someone else. Tonight, I flew back home and returned to my apartment, empty except for myself, for the first time. And this is the hardest part, because the constant attention of other people is beginning to fade; now I have to start to manage my own thoughts, like ""I'm never getting a cute little text from my mom at 9 pm ever again. She'll never tell me that she loves me again."" There are so many little things I took for granted.

Where do I go from here?",2019-01-29 12:51:41

All normal to me.

My husband arrived after work, and I told him my mom was here and she had brought her husband, and that’s when my sister drops the bomb, she knows the results my mom told her, they are positive. She brought her husband to be her support.

I felt like a bucket of cold water was dropped in me. The nightmare started again, I was feeling well, so happy, and know I feel like I’m being punish, like this is a cruel joke, first they tell me I have cancer, then they said the results were wrong and I’m fine and know again it’s positive?.
My family don’t understand it, but this is extra difficult for me, my cancer is endometrial, they have to do a hysterectomy, my dreams of having a baby have been ripped from me. I’m mourning the baby I have always dream with and that I will never have.

In a month my life has been a rollercoaster, this is like a joke to me, of course I had to get sick, in the middle of the pandemic and of course it had to be cancer. Of all of the years this could have came it had to be this f*cking year. 

I’m really scared of getting Covid while also battling against this cancer. I need support, support that non of my family members can give me. I feel alone, and even tho my husband says he is my support I don’t want to put that stress on him. I saw it, how his expression changed when my sister told me the news. I love him a lot and seeing like that breaks my heart. 

Physically I feel good like I cant possibly be sick with this, but as the doctor told me “cancer does not hurt”. I need to gather all of my strength and battle this sickness head on, after so much crying and asking why me, I feel ready to do it, and even I feel ready to die.

We have no idea how long she's had this tumor, only that its spread so fast that she has little chance of fighting it off.

Earlier this year she was diagnosed with it following a buildup of fluid in her lungs and she did her chemo shortly afterwards. Just a few days later, her right leg suffered an arterial blood clot due to the tumor and had to be amputated leaving her both crippled and in pain.

Her health then began deteriorating rapidly (up to the time that I write this) and my siblings and I have accepted that this is the end for her. She's in her bed right now sedated and slowly dying as her organs are appearing to shut down with every passing day. Just recently she stared having seizures which we suspect was due to the cancer reaching her brain.

To say she was a good person is an understatement. She raised four kids almost on her own and sacrificed an endless amount to get us where we are today, by far one of the strongest people I know of. She helped out heavily in the religious community and gave donations to those in need. And for all she's done this is how she gets rewarded. 

I'm not even religious but I've been praying with her and my family in hopes that whatever God there is can let her be in peace for crying out loud.

I just want her to pass on instead of living in all of this pain. She doesn't deserve to die like this.

Cancer has changed me in ways I never thought possible,88,ecqfir,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/ecqfir/cancer_has_changed_me_in_ways_i_never_thought/,13,1576772821.0,"A little bit of background :

I was diagnosed a little over a year ago at age 19 with malignant melanoma. I didn’t take it as serious at first because it’s ""just skin cancer"", but boy did that change quick. I was initially diagnosed Stage 3C, then after the first treatment failed, it grew rapidly resulting in me needing a ten hour surgery that was very difficult to recover from. The surgery was successful in removing the cancer in the area they worked on, but I developed immense pain in my leg soon afterwards which turned out to be one of five bone mets spread across my body that lit up on a PET scan. This obviously put me into Stage IV since my primary was on the very top of my head. 

In a recent trip to the acute care at my cancer hospital, masses on my left adrenal gland, and possibly the right as well, were found. However, I wasn't even phased by the news. I've now learned that cancer will do what it wants, when it wants. It doesn't care who you are or what's happening in your life or how young you are. I've had, and still have, my ""why me?"" moments, but I've come to learn that being negative about my situation will do nothing good. Whatever will happen, will happen, and there's nothing I can do to fight the inevitable. 

I  understand now that this is something I will be more than likely fighting for a very long time. It could even be the end of me, but to dwell on that is no way I want to live my life. I'm often stuck in bed in pain or sick from some other bullshit side effect from treatment, but this stupid ugly disease has made me the most grateful I've ever been in my young life. I’m not thankful that I have cancer, but I’m thankful for the journey it is continually putting me though.",2019-12-19 16:27:01

I went to Urgent Care to have it looked at and the Doctor I saw had me admitted to our local Heart Hospital as he felt I was a candidate for a pacemaker. 
Well, that wasn’t necessary, but I showed signs of “floating air” at n my abdominal cavity which a Cardiologist said could be a sign of cancer.
He also told me I should have my Primary Care run a CEA test.
She did two weeks ago and it came back elevated. Not by much, and if I were a smoker it wouldn’t be considered high.

Anyway, she thought I should be handed over to Oncology for follow up.
I know this one lab result isn’t conclusive of anything, but I’m freaking out a little and trying not to break down in tears. Having been thru this before I thought I’d be better prepared.

BTW, I had a colonoscopy in May that was clean, and the cardiologist who suggested the CEA told me “I’d be surprised if you have cancer, we’ve scanned the hell out of you and if you had anything we probably would have seen it.”

It was supposed to be Laparoscopic but the Ghost of Christmas Future visited my surgeon the night before and he decided we were doing the Full Monty.

So now I am dealing with 20 staples in my belly, a drain, and a poop bag. I must admit I am a big fan of the epidural. Other than the fact my left thigh was uselessly numb. But that stood me in good stead as they kept sticking me with heparin and I couldn't feel it.

But OMG the food. No wonder 20% of cancer patients starve to death. On the 3rd day after surgery the meal was so bad I burst into tears (which hurts like a mother fucker with staples in your belly). 

Then I called my favorite restaurant near the hospital and the boss ran me up my dinner. I hugged and cried on him too.

But I did get to leave on the 4th day. The poor weekend doctor came in to examine me to see if I was able to go home. I was dressed, packed and waiting for my T3 prescription to be written. That young fella had quite a funny look on his face but didn't attempt to stand in my way.

I couldn't understand why my nether regions felt like the aftermath of an '80s orgy but apparently, I got a bonus colonoscopy and lady bits exam. Yeah, me.

But the good news is Artie the Ass Tumor is no more. He was completely encapsulated and hadn't gone where he shouldn't.  Plenty of margins so my poop bag is temporary (and not as bad as you would think - don't be scared of it just don't eat hard-boiled eggs).

While the surgeon was in there he took a look-see at Larry the Liver who was looking great. The Daryll Tumors are still there of course but you couldn't tell by looking.

While I’m proud of her for this, I’m more proud of what she did while fighting terminal cancer in the Mayo Clinic.  She saw a bus full sick children.  It is easy to pass them off as being in the same boat and going on but it affected my mother SO much that in her last three years she gave numerous donations to saint Jude children’s hospital because she thought “everyone deserves a chance at living” 

She never bragged or had a sense of superiority, she did it for the sake of her fellow man and a hope and love for life.  I can never be as great as my mom and it’s important that everyone hears of my mom because she would never brag herself.

This is such a shitty feeling. I've been by her side for this whole adventure and it truly sucks seeing her slowly withering away. Lately it's go to sleep in pain, wake up in pain if we are lucky enough she can sleep.

My step father passed away of cancer so I've seen this process before and it's a difficult waiting game. I just pray that we can control her pain with hospice so she can finally be at ease.

Watched my Mom die. Feeling immense anger and guilt,90,ialdqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/ialdqd/watched_my_mom_die_feeling_immense_anger_and_guilt/,17,1597577040.0,"Mom was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer back in June. She'd been feeling pain for some time but kept it to herself until it was too late. A biopsy later revealed it was breast cancer that had metastasized to her bones. The doctors gave her six months to live without treatment so Mom opted to start treatment right away, but due to poor health insurance, the current Covid epidemic, and the pitfalls of bureaucracy she didn't get into the hospital until over a month later.

Since her health was already deteriorating so fast she basically had lost the ability to walk on her own at this point. There was a tumor on her spine and the doctors said if she didn't have surgery to remove it soon that she would be paralyzed for the remainder of her life. She had a spinal fusion which went well and at this point we were all hopeful and talking about life after moving her back home to live with everyone.
Since time was of the essence and she and everyone in our family agreed that she wanted to pursue treatment, she was given hormone therapy and her first round of chemo within a week of her surgery. Unfortunately, a few days later she developed pneumonia. Shortly thereafter, she had developed sepsis and a host of other infections and was put on a ventilator. At this point the doctors were already recommending palliative care and taking her off the ventilator to ""die with dignity."" One by one her organs began to fail her. First her right lung collapsed. Then her kidney started failing.

And finally last night, I watched her die through a phone. For me, the worst part about this was that I couldn't be there for her in person. I live abroad in China, and do to the current epidemic I cannot come back here if I were to leave and go back to the States. I have a wife and family here, so I opted to stay with the hope that she would get better and I could visit next year. Unfortunately, it didn't work out. 

She kept her eyes open the whole night until she finally fell asleep. I looked into her eyes and could see that she wasn't ready to go. My family that was with her were doing their best to send her off peacefully, but I got a little frustrated that they just kept offering her platitudes about going in peace, like they were just waiting for her to die, when it was so clear that she didn't want to go yet.

In the aftermath, I'm feeling immense anger and guilt. Anger towards a medical system that I view as having failed her. If she had never opted for treatment and just gotten palliative care, it's likely that she would have had more time and wouldn't have had to spend her last weeks on a ventilator in so much suffering. Anger that we all trusted the doctors and yet she died within weeks of entering the hospital. I'm no doctor, but in hindsight it seems clear that she was too weak to start treatment and needed more time to recover from her surgery and really make an informed decision whether treatment was the best course of action. It feels like the whole situation was so rushed.

And of course, guilt that I wasn't there for her in her greatest time of need. I'm her only son, and when she needed me most I wasn't there for her. We only got to have one conversation while she could still speak, and it was so rushed and hectic. Thanks to China banning all foreigns apps, I could not communicate with her directly even with a VPN and had to rely on my Aunt who had WeChat to video with her. Even though I got to say goodbye and speak with her at the end, it still doesn't feel the same as a real conversation would have. I don't know if I will ever forgive myself for not going back to see her and hug her one last time. 

That's all I have to say. I don't have many friends so it helps to get these feelings off my chest anonymously. Having experienced this first hand, I empathize so much more now with everyone here as I've been reading your experiences these last couple months. Cancer is a scourge to mankind and there's no platitudes to ease the pain.",2020-08-16 11:24:00

Coronavirus and collateral damage to cancer patients,93,fm70ls,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/fm70ls/coronavirus_and_collateral_damage_to_cancer/,76,1584783268.0,"Cancer is hard enough, but with the health system strained from coronavirus/CoVid-19, cancer patients will become collateral damage in order to save healthier people. This epidemic is a crisis, and that demands sacrifices, but it's tragic that people who have gone through so much, surviving months or years of chemo, radiation, surgery, and more, will not get the care they need and deserve. 

NYC hospitals now have a no visitor policy, unless the patient is end-of-life or incapacitated. Is your family member disabled, hard of hearing, or anxious? You can't help them. You can't be there. You just wait and hope they get out alive. 

That's if they get in the hospital at all; beds have already become scarce, and soon people ill with CoVid-19 will take them. That doctor, that room, that equipment that would handle a whipple procedure or lung resection will now go towards a patient that needs a ventilator. Surgeries are already being deferred, and, if they're not, the patient must recover in an environment latent with infection. They can't win.

Radiation has converted to the shortest courses necessary. For example, a typically long radiation course for colorectal cancer has been reduced to 5 days to minimize office visits and exposure.  Labs are closing indefinitely, delaying life-saving research. Doctors that normally request an office visit to help someone with, say, a neutropenic fever will err on the side of caution and have them stay home. Sometimes it won't be the right gamble.

Ultimately, lives will be shortened, lives will be lost. Not just by the hand of CoVid-19, but everything that comes with it. There will be a long tail of PTSD and anxiety for patients, caregivers, and healthcare workers when this is 'over'. I don't begrudge any institution for these choices, though I wish exceptions could be made. I simply lament what we'll lose.",2020-03-21 09:34:28

At the start of January with it back up to 20 I had cyberknife of 3 old spots in my brain just in case and one New spot in my lung zapped by radiation therapy. That dropped to 3.

This week it's come back as 8. I'm running very low of options and the oncologist is telling me it's time to make the serious decision about what to do going forward. Cure is very unlikely. What the fuck do I do? I'm 28. I don't know how to go ahead with this and how to not destroy my girlfriend and family by dying now.

I've been in touch with old mate einhorn in the US and he had nothing new and no one here in Australia has many other options.. It seems I'm fucked. If anyone has any valid options I'm looking for help.",2019-03-08 20:10:36
Finally a small victory.,91,adrh71,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/adrh71/finally_a_small_victory/,17,1546957698.0,My wife has been battling breast cancer on and off for 30 years.  She had it at 29 initially.   It came back in her airway in 2012.  It came back in her spine in 2016.   She's been on pill form chemo since 2016 and started full blown infusion Taxol in June of 2018.  It's been a shit 3 years.  She started hitting toxicity in November.  But the chemo was working and had driven the cancer back enough that the oncologist suggested we take a holiday.  So for 7 weeks there has been no chemo.   We had scans last week and our latest oncology appointment today.  Her cancer is stable.  It didn't shrink in further....but it didn't grow either.  So we are continuing our holiday for another 2 months.   This is the first time she's felt decent in almost 3 years.   I'm calling it a small victory.,2019-01-08 14:28:18

I just wanted to post some good news in the hopes that it could cheer someone up as it just made my day. I was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma in early April and I started chemo soon thereafter. This was in my last semester of college and I didn't know if I'd be able to complete the semester and graduate on time, but I just found out that I passed all of my classes and officially graduated!! I was pretty nervous because I walked in the ceremony two days after taking my hardest final and three days after finishing my 4th round of chemo. I think it goes without saying that I was beyond nervous especially since the last final was worth 40% of my grade and while taking it, my mind felt so slow and clouded from just having finished 5 days of chemo and I just felt pretty awful coming out of it. Anyway, I hope this helps someone today. Never give up!",2017-05-24 23:42:05

It was only a short 7 weeks from diagnosis to his last breath. I cannot believe how fast it all happened. In some ways I am grateful that he did not suffer long, but I wish so much for more time together. 

In the end he went very peacefully. The day before he died, we had a wonderfully lucid day together. He was more alert than I’d seen him all week. He told me he was ready to go and that he loved me. I will forever cherish that moment. He also spent a lot of time staring at something spectacular, very faintly saying “wow” over and over again. I’ve read that Steve Jobs did this exact thing before he passed. I like to think he was seeing the transition from this dimension into the next. He seemed so happy. He fell asleep that night and never woke up again. Yesterday, on the day of his passing, he slept all day, softly breathing. He never had the “death rattle” and up until the end he still had perfect vitals and porcelain skin. He waited until we had all fallen asleep and then slipped away quietly, on his own terms. Just about as peaceful as you can hope for. 

He is no longer suffering. No longer in pain. His fears and worries are gone. My heart is shattered, but forever full of his love. I will miss you so much Dad. ❤️",2020-02-23 06:42:46

I have two little boys and one of them is battling leukemia and I am just mad at the world,89,dquh6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/dquh6y/i_have_two_little_boys_and_one_of_them_is/,33,1572776629.0,"I have two boys (6yrs,3yrs) and my younger son was diagnosed with leukemia at 2 years old and I feel like I am suffucating under the weight of it all.

Do you know what it's like to physically have to help hold down my 3 year old every week for spinal taps? Or have to go into the emergency room every time he gets in the slightest fever when every ER visit means we will be there for a minimum of 5 hours and his port will be accessed? You know how easy it is to get a 3 year old to eat anything....well it's even more fun trying to get him to take his daily chemo medication. It's like all of the fun has just been sucked out of our lives. My 6 year old is great but he's still 6 year old and doesn't really care if my husband and I are tapped out. When my son was first diagnosed, we had many people and family offer to help with our older son. I am so done with friends or family telling us to ""just let them know how they can help"" and then never actually follow through on taking our older son for some fun. I am not expecting people to rearrange their own lives/schedules/families to help but God I feel like it's such an empty promise when you say this and then never actually follow through. 

And guess what? No one is signing up watch your child with leukemia so my husband and I could possibly have a second to breathe. I am stay-at-home right now and for the unforeseen future and it's all just too much. I see no one besides my children and my husband and our doctors. Should I go get therapy? Should everyone in our family go get therapy? Should we all be able to have some fun as a family? Yep but that's just not the way it works with this whole cancer situation. We are just heading into cold and flu season and I swear I'm getting hives over my anxiety over how many trips we will make to the hospital with fevers. I just want so badly to just say fuck it for a day. I just want to have a day-off for my family. I just want to wake up and have this all be a bad dream. I don't recognize myself or my life and I am just unrationally mad when I see families breeze in and out of the emergency room with a broken leg or something like that. I am exhausted by keeping a brave face for my little 3 year old who is just the best and constantly in pain. Due to his specific situation, he  is not walking....he can't even stand up. He used to be on toddler soccer team and could make it up little climbing walls and now he can't even stand. I see families with kids crossing the street at a red light and I'm mad at them - for having to live our life and this makes me frustrated with myself. I don't even know what the point of this post is. I guess I am wondering if there are any other parents out there like us who can relate. I'm not even looking for ideas of what I can do to make my situation more bearable because it's just hard....it hopefully won't be this hard always but right now it's just hard and it's even harder feeling like I'm isolated in this cancer/stay-at-home parent nightmare.

First the embolism, then the chemo not working. Then the loss of weight and appetite. I saw her fading slowly. And for the last month, as I visited for a month, I felt like it was going to be the end soon. And it was true. She left yesterday night. She will sleep peacefully forever. She was goddamn beautiful, I never saw anybody at peace like her. I will forever be grateful for everything she did for me. I love you mom, see you in another life.

I'm NOT going to die!!,89,81gxcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/81gxcq/im_not_going_to_die/,18,1520046725.0,"Glioblastoma Multiform is a horrific disease that quickly kills almost everyone who gets it.  Back at the end of November my oncologist gave me my prognosis, ""12-14 Months"".  I told him I wasn't going to die from this.

A week ago yesterday, I had my post-treatment MRI.  GBM is so aggressive, that the goal of chemo/radiation treatment is to slow down the cancer's grownth.  Mine didn't grow at all!!  This is even more exciting because I didn't get started with chemo and radiation until a month after my initial surgery.

In addition to not growing, even with a month where it should have grown like crazy, the tumor is mostly dead!!  

Yesterday, I got started with a new treatment, [Tumor Treatment Fields](http://www.onclive.com/conference-coverage/aacr-2017/tumor-treating-fields-substantially-improve-survival-in-gbm), which is a set of electrodes that I wear on my head all day, and it zaps the cancer as it tries to grow.

I'll also start my new round of chemotherapy as soon as the pills get to me.  It's going to be a lot bigger dose than my first round.  Between the TTF and chemo, I really believe my cancer will finish dying soon.  

I just want everyone reading this, to stay positive.  I wasn't supposed to live long, I stayed positive, now I will live.  My radiation oncologist told me he's seen patient attitude change prognosis many times.  He's seen people who should have lived, that had a poor attitude, and just gave up, who died quickly.  He's seen people who should have died quickly, who kept positive, who beat their cancer, and lived.  Personally, I watched my grandpa give up when he was diagnosed, and he died extremely quickly.  Long before I was born, my grandma was told she'd be dead in a year, she stayed positive and fought it, and she's still here almost 60 years later.

I'm not saying to skip treatment and just stay happy and hope to live.  I'm saying it helps.  ",2018-03-03 03:12:05

My Mom and I have been taking turns driving Dad up to Penn every single weekday for cancer treatment. On the days that I go, Dad and I have a routine. I wheel him to the cancer center, we check-in, and then I go get both of us coffees and muffins from Starbucks while he waits to be seen. He always gets a warm blueberry muffin and an Americano. I usually return - snacks in hand - before he even leaves the waiting room. Well... the woman in front of me at Starbucks today bought the last blueberry muffin. The cashier checked the back. Checked the front. Muffinless. 

""My Dad's in treatment for cancer and this muffin is the one thing he looks forward to about coming up here"" I stammer over the giant lump in my throat. Tears begin to roll down my face. I'm turning beet red. I'm losing control. I'm overwhelmed. I'm angry. I'm sad. My emotions are bubbling over. The cashier apologizes profusely, obviously uncomfortable about my impending emotional outburst. I settle for a blueberry scone, give her my money, and immediately scramble to the corner of the room where I hide my face and wipe my tears... embarrassed. 

I feel a hand on my shoulder. I look up to find a middle aged black woman in business attire staring down at me. ""I just wanna give you a hug."" she says. I melt into her embrace as she soothes me saying ""I know honey, it's hard. I lost my father to cancer last year. It's okay to cry. It's okay to feel. You'll be okay. There are just some things that you can't control. Even muffins."" We part with a smile. I thank her for her kind words. She leaves with a friend, coffee in hand. 

I clean up my face. I grab our order from the barista. I go back down to the cancer center. Dad is gone, having been called for his treatment. Minutes later he's wheeled out to the waiting area by a member of the staff. I plaster a smile on my face, holding out the Starbucks goodies. We go the car. He eats his scone and never mentions the missing muffin. I don't mention my experience either.

I had my last vincristine today, and I just have tablets until 3rd July. I officially go into remission 4th July.

I don’t know how to feel. On one hand, it’s a relief. I have finally stopped and I can go back to normal. But on the other hand, I’m scared. I’m scared that my leukaemia will relapse. I’m scared to have my bone marrow test and portacath removal surgery. 

I’m scared that my friends I have made since I was diagnosed will leave me. I feel like they were only friends out of sympathy. They tell me that’s stupid, but I really think that. 

I’m nervous to go back to  school full time, after 2 1/2 years out of school.

I’m frustrated that it has robbed my life.

I’m guilty for surviving this, when my friend didn’t survive (he was 13. Rest his soul).

I’m annoyed that I’m covered in scars.

I’m upset that I have gained 20lbs since starting treatment. I look fat now.

I’m annoyed at how the medications made me ugly (chubby face, gained weight, chemo spots, rashes,etc) 

I’m annoyed at how it’s changed me.

I’m annoyed that it has stolen my teenage years, and will rob the rest of them as I have been forced to grow up.

Quit Chemo,88,9zlcri,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/9zlcri/quit_chemo/,23,1542978673.0,"One week ago my fiance was supposed to receive a round of chemo. Unfortunately, his oncologist recommended that he stop chemo and focus on palliative care. She said it as kindly and concisely as she could to a roomful of his loved ones (his mother, step-father, father, aunt and myself). 

It wasn't the news we were hoping to hear but, after conferring with the radialogist regarding his brain scan results, the oncologist said that there was no point in continuing chemo to treat the tumors in his other body parts when the cancer in his brain was not manageable. She said that he had days or weeks but not months. We all cried and hugged each other. 

The whole day was like a dream afterwards. The future I pictured for us was shattered. My fiance was kept for a few hours to get fluids into him because he was dehydrated and I drove us home after. Throughout it all he still refused to give up. Other than our initial cry session in the doctor's office he showed no other worry about the results. I asked him on the ride back home what his thoughts were and he insisted that he would still beat it. I didn't have the heart to do anything but agree and I still don't. 

Two days later we were packing up and heading to his father's beach house for some rest and relaxation. Two days after that it was decided that we would stay here from here on out and that I would receive some help with the caregiver duties (after his older brother walked an hour in my shoes when I had a particularly hard day involving several dirty adult diapers and called him for help). 

Now, he is snoring away in a hospital bed in his father's livingroom after a full day of festivities. However many days he has left I'm making it my mission for him to enjoy every single one. ",2018-11-23 13:11:13

 I’ve been suffering from horrible back pain all year, and here I was thinking it was all my time at the computer doing online classes giving me back pain! According to my doctor I’ve got a 10 x 15cm tumor on my liver, pressing into my diaphragm and stomach. Regional spread to lymph nodes. Been through one round of chemo and getting my port put in tomorrow. it’s been a crazy three weeks for me. 

I guess it’s my family, that’s the hardest part. This year was supposed to be a big deal for me, graduating college and moving out into the world and whatnot, but instead I’m stuck at home in lots of pain, getting bizarre (to me) medical treatments and generally just laying around exhausted. I can handle that sort of thing, life is full of these types of challenges after all, but it’s my family that makes it tough. My mother and father have to see me like this, my younger siblings have watched their older brother turn into what seems like an old man. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is, that even though I am the one suffering through cancer, it’s seeing the way it affects those around me that hurts the most. I hate feeling like I’m ruining everything for them. Like their perfect life was derailed because i decided to get a disease that statistically I shouldn’t even have!!! I worry that, if I die, this will affect them in ways I can’t imagine. Maybe I’m just being vain, but I really just wanted to vent 

Let me know if any of you have been through something like this, and if anyone else here has experience with Intra-Hepatic Bile Duct cancer I could sure use some pointers because I’m new at this!

I have a friend that is fighting for his life. 3 weeks after getting a certificate  for completing 12 rounds of chemo. He made it less than two weeks because he has been in The ICU since last week Saturday.

The cancer did not go into remission, he was not NED at all, but they made a huge thing about his last round. 

He had to go for an emergency operation as his tumor grew and blocked his colon. He could not pass anything, not gas not solids, nothing.
Now he is on a machine that keeps him breathing as his lungs are shot. The oncologist told him not to stop smoking as his body won’t be able to take the stress.

Last night was the first time he woke up as he was in a coma. His daughter said that he can’t understand what is going on. Why he has tubes in every hole in his body. AFAIK the doctor did a colostomy for him.

But still, after ringing the bell and making a huge fuss. The false hope it gave him that he was done with cancer and then few days later cancer almost took him out?

My Bone Marrow Donation Process and Recovery,85,bn9o4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/bn9o4s/my_bone_marrow_donation_process_and_recovery/,34,1557590427.0,"TL;DR - I had a surgical procedure to donate bone marrow to a 13 year old girl with Severe Aplastic Anemia. I wanted to share a few details about the procedure for anyone who may be interested in signing up as well. 

https://m.imgur.com/HVtcohk

I wanted to share my story of donating bone marrow so that anyone else who is considering it or has questions about it may be a bit more informed.

In Feb of 2017 I was scrolling social media and saw an add to join the Be The Match registry. I thought to myself, “I have no reason not to do this. I’m going to sign up.” However, life distracted me and I never did. 2 weeks later I began the next book in the series of my favorite author, Harlan Coben (amazing thriller/murder mystery novelist), and it was about a boy who needed a bone marrow donation and the donor ghosted. I immediately signed up on the registry this time.

Exactly one year later, I received a phone call and an email stating that I was a potential match for a 13 year old girl with Sever Aplastic Anemia, a life threatening immune system disease. I immediately agreed to go through with the procedure.

The process involves an over the phone health surgery, an additional blood screen and a physical exam. Afterwards, the wait began. However, the patient experience multiple setbacks that delayed the donation twice. Finally, in late March 2019, the procedure was a go.

I must say that Be The Match is amazing. Not one dime out of pocket between the hospital visits, the procedure, or anything. They even flew my mom in to watch our 4 month old daughter.

The procedure went really smoothly. There are two ways to donate. One is surgical and one is through a process more like giving blood. My patient’s doctor requested the surgical procedure. Anyway, they used general anesthesia to put me under and used. Hollow needle to penetrate my hip bones from the back in two small incisions. From there they extracted  liters of bone marrow. I was in and out of the hospital within 5 hours. 

The procedure was painless obviously because I was under, but the recovery has a few pains and aches with it. Honestly, it is not horrible. I was super exhausted for 2 days due to the anesthesia and the amount of marrow extracted. The site of the procedure cause some aching in my lower back. It’s more discomfort than pain. They provide adequate medication to help with this. Honestly, the hardest part is just taking it easy for me. I’m a “always on the move” guy. Anyways I’m 3 days post-op and can move with very little limitation or discomfort. It’s still sore and achey, but nothing serious. I would donate again tomorrow if I needed to.

I hope this provides insight into the process and please feel free to ask any questions. Also, please let me know if you decide to sign up. It really is an opportunity to give someone else another shot at life.

My Son is recovering from a tumor which was removed from his head,85,b3tixn,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/b3tixn/my_son_is_recovering_from_a_tumor_which_was/,30,1553219007.0,"Last Tuesday, I took my 16-year-old son, Josh, to see his doctor about an issue he had been having with his right leg. He would constantly feel like his knee was going to ""give out"" on him when he walked. I had noticed more and more that his gait had changed, and he had trouble getting around.

His doctor asked some questions, observed him walking around in the examination room, tested his strength, etc., and suggested that we take him to see a neurologist. Not even an hour later, she called my wife to say that she felt like he should be seen ASAP and if an appointment couldn't be made with neurology, then we should take  him into the ER for a CT scan.

The next day (Wednesday) my wife took him into the ER for a scan. The scan detected a mass in his brain, and some swelling. He was transferred via ambulance to the Betsy Devos Children's hospital. A MRI confirmed that he had a tumor in his head.

Thursday, he had lost all feeling/movement in his right arm, and had trouble moving his right leg. By Saturday, the right side of his mouth was drooping a bit as he lost muscle tone in his face. I left the hospital with plans to return on Monday for a meeting with Josh's surgeon, and the word from doctors was that his operation to remove the tumor would be on Thursday.

However, on Sunday Josh's surgeon decided that he had deteriorated enough that they needed to operate on Monday. The operation was a success; 100% of the tumor was removed. On Tuesday night, he was returned to the operating table for a suspected blood clot. As it turned out, fluid had gotten trapped inside the space left behind by the removed tumor, and pressure was building in his head.

He is currently recovering in ICU. Between Monday and Tuesday, he was constantly sleeping. When awokened, he was able to communicate with hand motions. He has not spoken since Monday morning prior to his surgery.

I am grateful that his surgery was scheduled earlier than expected, and also that the tumor was entirely removed. I just wish that he was able to talk, and that we could focus on working with him to get the use of his right arm and leg back. We are also waiting for the results of the biopsy to come back, so that we have a better idea of what kind of tumor it was.",2019-03-22 01:43:27

2 years tomorrow!!,86,dwegf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/dwegf5/2_years_tomorrow/,16,1573788474.0,"Tomorrow will be exactly 2 years ago I got my 'official' diagnosis.  I will never forget that phone call.

I had had my craniotomy 6 days prior, and had been home from the hospital for 2 days.  Before my surgery they told me, ""Next Friday, you'll come back to get your biopsy results"".  It didn't quite go that way.

Before surgery, they told me if ""*X* bad thing happens during surgery, you'll be moved to the ICU instead of this room"".  I don't remember what it was, but it happened, and that next morning, I woke up in the ICU.  

A doctor who I had never seen face-to-face, but was involved with my surgery, came into my room, said ""It looks like cancer"", then turned around and walked away.

I was released from the hospital that Monday, with the plan for me to return to the hospital to meet my oncologist and get my biopsy results on Friday.  That Wednesday, my wife was at work, and my kids were at school.  I was home alone all day.

I got a phone call from the hospital.  I figured they were just calling to remind me of my appointment.  NOPE.  They verified it was me on the line, and told me ""Biopsy results are back early.  You have Glioblastoma.  Get your affairs in order, you have a few months"".

Being home alone, I broke down.  Then I spent the next 2 days reading about this monster in my brain.  Friday finally rolls around, and my wife and I go to my appointment.  I knew about all there is to know about this beast, I knew my prognosis, I knew it all.  I told my oncologist, who I was meeting for the first time, ""I'm gonna kick this thing"".  He replied, ""No, you're not"".

Well, I'm still here.  My tumor stayed stable for about 6 months.  Then it steadily shrank for another 6 months.  A year ago, my doc stopped chemo, my only 'treatment' now is cannabis oil and a few vitamins and supplements, it's still not growing.  I started out with a lemon sized tumor, and now it's a marble.

TL:DR, never give up hope.  Live and Love as much as you can, nobody knows when their number will come up, cancer or not.",2019-11-15 03:27:54

One issue though, the drug isn't wildly available on the NHS, its only given out under strict parameters and I don't meet them. In order to get this drug I have to pay two grand per injection and would need an injection every few weeks. Which is completely unrealistic for me and I can't justify dropping that amount of money on a dead girl even if its just once. I don't think I could pay it once.

They gave my dad a year and a half to live. It's been 8 months and he's on his deathbed.,85,ch3e43,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/ch3e43/they_gave_my_dad_a_year_and_a_half_to_live_its/,20,1563971309.0,"My dad was diagnosed with stage 3 Mesothelioma after going in to see a doctor for pain in his lung. Part of it had collapsed and investigative surgery found his ribcage lined with cancer. He was 58 years old and the strongest, healthiest, fittest man the doctors had ever met for his age. 
He outright refused chemo and ended up qualifying for Keytruda, so we went that route instead. A few months in and it just wasn't working. My dad opted to try a pseudoscientific treatment that insurance wouldn't cover... that obviously didn't work either. 

We took a big family trip while he was still walking. He was in pain for most of it. Now he is bed ridden, won't eat anything but jello, and is usually delirious. He's so tiny and frail. He weighed 200 lbs at 6'1 last year. Now he probably weighs 140. 

It's so hard for me to see him waste away. I don't understand my emotions. Instinctively, I'm trying to distance myself, like I'm cushioning for the blow. But that is so selfish. I force myself to stay close, help when he needs it, and tell him I love him as often as I can. Sometimes my own strength scares me. Sometimes I can talk as openly about what is happening as if I'm telling the weather. Other times I just break at random moments and sob until my throat is raw. But I only let him see the strong in me; the rock on the outside; the brave little warrior I've always been for him. 

 It's so hard to lose your dad at 20 years old. It hurts so, so bad. We were supposed to see the world together. How will I ever recover from this loss? It is like watching the world end from space.",2019-07-24 12:28:29

The hardest part for me was admitting to myself that I first felt relief rather than sadness when she passed. 

I was told that hearing was one of the last senses to go, I whispered to her to let go and be at peace that we would be okay. She passed a few hours later.
Tonight, just thinking about that moment broke me. 
The fact that I won’t be able to hug and kiss her again, hurts so much. 

Cancer is fucking horrible, it took my mum before she got to see me graduate, hold my future kids, see me get married and most of all - it took her away before I had a chance to repay her for all she’s done for me. 

I miss you mum, love you forever.

This shit sucks,83,9iooj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/9iooj6/this_shit_sucks/,51,1537874534.0,"I'm 18 years old, I graduated from high school this past June, and I had one of the best summers of my life. Senior week down at the beach; a full week of nonstop partying with some of my closest friends. Immediately after, I went a week-long cruise down to the Caribbean - my first time travelling outside the United States. My mom, aunt, uncle, and I traveled to Grand Turk, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic, where I saw water that I never thought could be so brilliantly blue (it was tough returning back north and seeing the familiar murky gray of Delaware beaches haha). I worked outside all summer long as a lifeguard and recently got promoted to head guard. After summer ended, I was going to take some gen eds at a community college for the first semester and then transfer into the University of Pittsburgh (my dream school) in January where I planned to do Army ROTC and major in Criminal Justice for the next 4 years of my life.

About a month ago I started to notice that my lymph nodes on my neck were swelling up. I had one of them do this before a few years ago and it eventually went back down so I didn't really think much of it at first. A couple weeks later, I began noticing that I had similar swollen glands in my armpits and around my groin, so I went to the doctor, figuring that I had some weird sickness and that they could throw me some antibiotics and clear it right up. They ran some blood tests and couldn't figure out what was wrong with me. A couple appointments later, I had an awful headache and a sore throat; my tonsils looked like shit. My parents figured that I had Mono or something, which honestly made sense. All summer, partying with friends, sharing drinks, I could definitely see it happening. The doctors office did swabs for both Mono and Strep, both of which came back negative. My physician ad no idea what I had, so she recommended that I go over to the emergency room and have an infectious disease doc look at me there. Went to the ER where I had a *grand* ol time that night. They poked and prodded me until about 3 am and told me to get a biopsy done on my nodes to see what the deal was. They said that it might just be some strange virus, but that it might be something more sinister like Lymphoma. They couldn't be sure until I got the biopsy done though, so that was the next step.

Went to go see an ear, nose, and throat doctor about the lumps and the biopsy and got the biopsy done on one of the nodes under my chin a couple days later. The results came back as positive for Lymphoma. Went to the cancer center a couple days ago where the doc there effectively told me that my entire life was going to be turned upside down for the next few months. The doc I visited in the cancer center also took a bone marrow sample from my tailbone and I swear to god that has to  be the most humiliating procedure of all time.

My lymphoma is aggressive and malignant, and because it's aggressive, it needs to be met with an equally aggressive treatment. The initial chemo is going to be at least a week long and I'm getting admitted to the cancer center this Wednesday (9/26) to start it. The treatment is going to last for several months, which may mean that I might not be able to go to Pitt in January and even if I do, I probably wouldn't be able to start ROTC this year, which I was *really* looking forward to. I'm probably going to lose my hair, too yay!

Maybe it's just me, but I can't fucking *stand* sympathy. I absolutely despise it. I don't want people to feel sorry for me. I don't want people to go *aww poor guy* and feel bad for me. That's bullshit. I don't want to be looked down on and pitied, yet that's all that I can see around me at this point. The only person who's made me feel better about it was my best best friend Sam (if you're reading this, I love you buddy). When I told him I had cancer, he just laughed and said, ""Ha! That sucks! At least you can go on a rampage like Archer now!""

That was beautiful and perfect. I just want to be treated the same as I was before I had cancer. I don't want to be the hushed conversation topic at everyone's house, I just want to feel normal damn it. I really hate that ""warrior"" stuff, too. I don't feel like a warrior at all, I feel like some unlucky asshat who got cancer. Like it sucks and the treatments are going to be tough, but I just don't see the victims of cruel circumstances as ""warriors"". Sure, they can be tough and resilient, but calling someone stuck in a hospital bed a ""warrior"" just seems demeaning to me. Just my own opinion on the subject.

Gonna be going in this Wednesday to be admitted to the cancer center. They're gonna pull out the sutures in my chin from my biopsy and shove some big tube into my chest and heart to mainline this chemo shit. Sounds like a good time.

Sorry for the short novel, just kinda needed to get this off my chest because the past couple weeks has kinda been a massive slap in the dick. Feels bad, but I don't want people to pity me and I've already made my peace with it for the most part.

I bonded with some of the people on the unit, I felt great for some & my heart broke for others who’s day didn’t go great and their plans have to change.

I am grateful that the drugs didn’t give me any adverse reactions or bad side effects, so far, touch wood.

I’m thankful for the Chemotherapy nurses and the Sisters who have worked short staffed and tirelessly. They broke their backs to make sure all the patients were happy & comfortable & seen to as quickly as possible when needed. They are true hero’s, even working hours and hours overtime so that we patients didn’t suffer as they were understaffed to begin with!


Things I will carry forward to next time are:

Wear comfier clothes, leggings just aren’t comfy enough and not warm enough.

Take some slippers or at the very least some very warm, cozy slipper socks.

Take a blankey, it’s a little something extra to feel more at home & warm in a very clinical setting.

More snacks, the steroids made me ravenous, I would of liked to have had a few of my favourites.

I posted a venting session here a few weeks ago. My two year old son was diagnosed with Leukemia in November of last year, my three year old dog had just been diagnosed with cancer the day before (and we didn't know how severe), my parents had just sold there house and were living with us, my mom had her planned hysterectomy go poorly and result in a lot of complications while they were living with us, my brother had just had a baby who was failing his hearing tests and possibly deaf, and to top it all off both my mom and son were in the hospital at the same time the week that I posted..... we had a lot going on.  So here's a nice little update.

&#x200B;

I am happy to report today that my dog's cancer did not spread! They think they got all of the malignant tumor with the surgery and now we just have to keep an eye out for future bumps.

&#x200B;

My mom is on the mend after having a PICC line installed and being on heavy antibiotics this month. My parents have bought their new house and have moved in!

&#x200B;

As for my brother's baby - they are still doing testing, but we are confident we can handle whatever the outcome is.

&#x200B;

And last, but not least, my baby boy with Leukemia. This kid is such a trooper. His strength truly inspires me every day. He is doing so well with treatment. We are close to the end of front-line (\~1 year) and we are slated move into Long Term Maintenance in November (\~2 additional years).

Life updates (in stream of consciousness [?] form):

- I just had another MRI on Monday that I don’t know the results of. 
- I’ll likely be able to do another 10-15 doses of radiation, according to Dr. Gardner.
- I’ve had nightmares about my tumor spreading to my brain stem.

I very recently started using CBD oil and that helps with the anxiety some. I think I might have PTSD.
- My New York visits are now every six weeks. 
- I desperately want to have surgery at some point. I want more time. I NEED more time.
- I’ve got a new therapist. I see him again tomorrow.
- My mom’s looking for a better job. 
- I applied for and got SSI in less than 2 weeks. 
- I received a dream from my local Dream Factory chapter that just got fulfilled. I’m turning 19 later this month (March), so it had to happen before now.

I still can't believe it. He just came back from his chemo and I went to check up on him and he was unresponsive. My life is a complete and utter mess. I'm trying to keep it together and balance school/work and my mom is just so broken. 

I miss him a lot and I had no idea this would happen to him. There weren't any signs. Just one minute he was fine and the next he was gone. He was very stubborn and refused to get treated until we forced him to get checked out. We only found out he had cancer six weeks ago and now he's dead. 

Sure, him and I had our differences, but I just can't believe it. I've been putting in my all these past six weeks and I barely get any sleep cause I was constantly taking care of him. I just turned 19 a few days ago and I can't help but be sad about not having him with me for the rest of my life. I just had a normal conversation with him and the next thing I know he's dead. I don't know what to do

For those who experienced something similar... how do you cope? Does it actually get easier? And i also just feel a little alone. I want to talk to people other than my family but I can't in conscience just text people I haven't talked to in awhile that my Dad is dead, it just feels selfish and I'd be putting a massive burden on whom I tell it to.

What I really could have used were...

1. Discounts on band-aids. Nothing wanted to heal during chemotherapy and I went through band-aids like you wouldn't believe.

I guess I just couldn‘t bring myself to write it all out until we were through the woods... nonetheless you've all been a great help & comfort to me these past months.

My mum, my best friend, made it into remission again and I‘m so happy!

On 1st Aug she was diagnosed with T3N2M0 NSCLC Adenocarinoma in her right lung. They weren’t sure she’d make it as the the tumours were already 3.5cm and one was very close to her heart. Cue 6 weeks of radio & chemo to see if they could shrink the tumours away from her heart & ribs, to make it operable.

7th Jan she had 8 hours of surgery; a Lobectomy to remove 2/3 of her right lung & the affected lymph nodes. A complete success. She‘s been home a week now, and just got the great news from her chief surgeon & oncologist. They don’t want to see her for 3 months (unless something bad happens with her recovery). The pathology/histology results were all clear.

She‘s been so brave, and fought so hard, stayed positive & determined through the whole ordeal. She‘s been a champion.

This cancer was caused by the treatment from her last dance with the devil, 25 years ago (in 1993) she had stage 3 breast cancer, which, given the time, was treated with a radical mastectomy of her right breast followed by chemo & extreme radiotherapy. The radiotherapy they used back then was too strong, and her lung cancer was directly below the treatment point of her breast cancer. I was just a child when she had breast cancer, so I wasn’t privy to the details until I got copies of her old files for the doctors this time ‘round.

I‘m so happy that tears are rolling down my face, and for the first time in 6 months I feel like I can breathe again. This all started 2 days after my husband & I returned from our honeymoon, so the last year has been a crazy rollercoaster... he has been such a great support through all of this, I don’t know what I would have done without him by my side.

We still have a long road to go recovering from the surgery, and training up her lungs to get the oxygen she needs to live a normal life again, plus strength & appetite as she’s down to 43kg, but I know we‘ll make it. Mum: 2, Cancer: 0.

She was a fighter until the very end and although the doctors said it would be a miracle if she survives until Christmas, she did it on her own terms and went away after it passed. She was so strong in fact that she waited for me and my sister to go see her in the morning. Once we were there, she left us in about 2-3 minutes. I don’t know anyone who is as strong as she is.

To everyone fighting - stay strong, keep moving, eat healthily and bring in as much joy in your life as you can.

I (26f) just got diagnosed with (at least stage 3, possibly stage 4 depending on my bone marrow biopsy this Wednesday) diffuse large B cell non Hodgkin’s lymphoma. It’s been almost 2 months from my initial appointment to my pcp to my official diagnosis and honestly things have gone down hill quick. My cancer is a very aggressive type, which I suppose is a double edge sword, because with this blood cancer the more aggressive kind respond better to chemo then slow progressing ones. When my diagnosis journey first started, I went running 3 miles the morning of my first ultrasound. Now I feel like I can hardly function doing day to day chores without feeling completely sick and run down. It’s so scary to feel yourself go down hill, especially so fast. I was never the one to be sick, I’ve always been active and taken care of myself, so both physically and mentally this downfall has been difficult. That being said I am tentatively planned to start chemo this Friday! I know chemo is no cakewalk but neither is this. Chemo is pain with purpose. I just want to start feeling better soon. I wish everyone their best on their journey. Cancer is something I wish no one had to go through.",2020-08-31 04:38:19

Felt really weird when instead of telling me when my next chemo session was, he just told me to make an appointment with the receptionist to see him in September for a check up.

My dad was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer on January 29th and next week is his funeral,83,8b6y4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/8b6y4u/my_dad_was_diagnosed_with_pancreatic_cancer_on/,29,1523389241.0,"I just want to share my experience and some of my views if it can be help to anyone. Sorry for the long post

Like the title says he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer on January 29th after experiencing a series of symptoms starting around new year. Early symptoms were vomiting, struggling to eat, he described a feeling of a blockage and pain to the back and abdominal area. Over the first few weeks of the year they tried enemas, laxatives and managing the vomiting. That was until they finally got round to doing scans and saw a growth on the pancreas. 

We went to the hospital on the 29th not knowing what they would say. My dad was in alot of pain that day. The meeting with the doctor still feels like yesterday. I remember my dad asking if it was terminal but the doctor just replied with how he doesn't like that word and how something can be done for everyone. Anyway my dad was admitted to the hospital for a couple of weeks so they could get him stable and eating again. 

He seemed close to normal in the hospital after a day or so and was like that until he came home. This is where I started to look after him. What I got to see at this point is how bad he would get throughout the night. The medication he was on only seemed to work until around 2 in the morning. Then the pain seemed to go upto 11. He would cry out in pain and want a hot water bottle. One at first but we had to get a second as it wasn't enough. Now a quick warning. I dont know if it was the cancer or the pain killers but my dad would put them under his back and they would burn him without us knowing. That was until one day i checked his back and it was brown and patterned. 

Over the time i looked after him the pain became worse and so did his symptoms. I would say the key changes were becoming less interested in food again, sleeping throughout most of the day, easily confused, nodding off during doing tasks and becoming weaker and weaker. That was until he took bad one night and was sick bile for the first time. The day after he was admitted into hospital again as he was very confused and in pain. He had too much calcium in the blood and a stomach blockage. 

He was in hospital for around a week as they levelled out his blood levels and sorted out the blockage. He was alright enough to discharge again on the Wednesday but that day would be the last day he would eat. 

He was home for 3 days before he started to vomit bile and he was screaming in pain. So on the Sunday morning an ambulance came and he wad admitted into hospital for the last time. This time the doctors just thought it was a gallbladder infection. Talked about getting my dad better and discharge him. Oh yeah he still had months left they told us. So the doctors got my dad stable again but he wasnt eating and pain was still a problem.

Over the next few weeks the weight just fell off my dad and he couldn't even be awake some days when I visited. Other days he would be very angry and grumpy. Then one day he fell in the shower and the next he was in the hospice. 

First couple of days he seemed okay. We chatted when he could. Then again on Wednesday he took ill and was sick more bile. It was the first time he looked like he was dying. He was stick thin and i could see his heart beat through his t shirt moving. 

The hospice thought it was a blockage in the stomach or gallbladder and tried to fix it. They also tried to put a tube down my dads nose into his stomach but since he had a broken nose a few years ago, they couldn't. That was the last day my dad was fully aware. They put him on a morphine drip and that was it until the Sunday. 

He was responsive until the weekend. Even if you could only get a few words of conversation for the entire visit. I got the dreaded phone call last Monday morning, the 2nd of April. By the time i got there he had just gone. 

I know going through cancer is not easy for anyone. I did all i could but i still regret getting frustrated at my dad when he was grumpy. I felt bad on the days where i needed to get out for a bit for my own sake and leaving him. But remember that cancer changes all that it touches, even if we are just the ones left caring or picking up the pieces. Do whatever you need to do to get through it. There is no textbook on how so dont be afraid to ask for help like i may have been. Trust your gut, doctors can be wrong about how long is left so just take each day as it comes. Lastly, if your loved ones personality does change, remember that they still love you and that the cancer is just causing them alot of pain, confusion and is a massive hit to mental health anyway. This is evident as even though my dad was grumpy or sleeping when I saw him, when others visited he told them to look after me after hes gone. Remember that it will pass. It felt like forever going through it but now this year has flown over. 

Thank you for reading this. It was alot longer than I thought it would be. But it feels good to get it off my chest. ",2018-04-10 19:40:41

She's on palliative care now and honestly I feel the end is near. She's on morphine, has lost 25 kg in three months, is basically skin and bones and her legs are extremely swollen and she can't stand well. Mostly is sedated all day because she has panic attacks when awake. I know she is probably going to go soon but I don't want to see her in such distress. She's on antidepressants but they help little. She's also having tremors and has difficulty breathing despite having good oxygen saturation (98%). I think most of it is anxiety related but don't know how to help at all. She likes games so when she's lucid we talk about games and about our cat (who she adores) and also pray (she's turned back religious and despite being an atheist, I do believe it brings her comfort so I don't mind) but don't know how to help her more. Any suggestion would be appreciated. 

PD: I also worry for my mom, she's a doctor and she has been her main caretaker and today she looked so broken. Of course I feel extremely sad too but I worry it would be too much for my mom to bear.

Diagnosed last May with triple-negative metaplastic breast cancer (57f). Went through 4 months of infusion chemotherapy, a mastectomy, six weeks of daily radiation treatments, and now I’m halfway through the final treatment, a 6-month regimen of chemo in pill form. Radiation burns healed, hair grown back and really starting to plan for and think in terms of my imminent return to normal life. And then ... 

Found out this week that the cancer has probably metastasized to my lung. PET scan and biopsy next week to verify, but my oncologist is fairly certain. And so the whole hateful circus begins again, only this time with much lower expectations, as this type of cancer has proven to be aggressive and chemo-resistant, and for a variety of reasons, surgery is not an option this time around. My doctor is already talking about clinical trials and “innovative” therapies, which I take as a bad sign.

Trying to stay positive and not feel sorry for myself, but I’m just so sad and disappointed and so PISSED! I knew there was a fairly high likelihood of recurrence, but I just thought I would have more time, some time to be normal again. It was so close...

I know I’m only one of thousands, probably millions, of people hearing the same news and facing the same prospects right at this very moment.

Forgive me for not knowing the technical term, but he developed a blood clot of some sort due to his chemo port. That’s when the Dr’s all conferred and told us there was really nothing they could do at this point, besides pain management. 

We prayed and prayed, and hoped for a miracle. But that miracle didn’t come. It’s been almost 2 years of slowly losing hope, and realizing that we were all powerless in a hopeless situation.

I have been fighting this for three years but for the last year treatment has just been palliative.  Even when I'm not on chemo I feel myself fading slowly. And there is absolutely no one that I can talk to about it.  

I have been the cheerful cancer warrior all this time but I just can't keep it up.  When I am sad, or frustrated or anything less than merry sunshine my family avoids me.  I know that it isn't malicious, they just aren't coping.  But what it means is I get the silent treatment from my husband and kids when I'm unhappy.  And I have talked to him about this *repeatedly*, but only after I cheer up again because that's what it takes to get him to speak to me.  

My closest friend can be good for some dark humor but a few weeks ago when my husband was avoiding me I texted her and she said she didn't want to get caught in the middle of us.  The two of them were already texting about me but neither would speak to me.  So I've had to revise my expectations from ""best friend"" to ""mutual friend"". 

My extended family has distanced themself since the terminal diagnosis. 

I am depressed, obviously and understandably.  I am on an antidepressant for nerve pain and it helps a little.  Cannabis oil (legal stuff) has really become a crutch because it's the only thing that keeps me smiling (and relieves other symptoms).  Yes I have had therapy, for me personally in my situation it just made me feel worse.

So here I am, on a tropical Christmas holiday that will certainly be my last, with 6 genuinely miserable humans that I love more than anything and no access to the medication that makes life bearable.

This sub is so great bc of all the support. Just from my short time here (mostly lurking) it's insane the outpouring of support everyone gets when they need it.
It's weird and unique bc I can't help feeling bad for ppl with a bad prognosis or really sad posts. To me, I can't help feel a littke awkward when I read the posts about someone being in the up and up or being cancer free. I can't imagine how it feels to read that type of post when you're nowhere near there. And yet, somehow, everyone is supportive here somehow. Absolutely blew my mind.

I've been on chemo until last week when I finished (yay), and I've just started on tamoxifen. My daughter (26) lives 90 mins drive from me. I drove to see her to break the news to her. I feel sad since then she hasn't been to visit once. She has a car, and disposable income, and she doesnt work weekends. I have a guest room all ready for her. 

I feel envious when  I read posts from people whose parents have cancer, and they've quit jobs or school to move back to be close to them.

I have felt very alone throughout chemo. Im divorced, and I only moved here a few months before diagnosis so I hadn't yet made friends, and I haven't been able to get work because of being sick. I have had no one to help: no helpful casseroles, no one to run  a vacuum around the place. I focus on the positives, and seeing a therapist helped a lot. But I have felt very alone and unsupported.

I drove down to visit my daughter three times this year, but driving the distance was hard with the nausea and aches and pains from my medications, and with no income I feel apprehensive about the gas costs for the trip. I couldn't afford to get a motel/hotel overnight so I had to drive there and back in one day, which wasn't ideal.

 I wish so much my daughter would have come up to visit me. No,  I wish she'd *wanted* to visit me. Until now I thought we had a normal, close, loving, functional relationship. We text every couple of days, about shit on reddit, or what's in the news, or something cool she saw in a store. Now I feel I have to reevaluate everything. She's just starting her adult life, so it's normal her focus is on her boyfriend and her career. But when I read posts from other redditors I feel sad we don't have the closeness I thought we did. I'm not sure how I could have been a better mom to have made my daughter want to see me, and I dont feel like I have the physical or emotional energy right now to address this with her.

I was sitting at home and the small business that my mom worked for called me. It was her boss on the phone, he proceeded to pass the phone to my mom. She said “Hi” and everything after that was a mumbled mess.. she passed the phone back to her boss. 

-side note-

(I have worked for this small business so I know the owner personally. And when I say small business, I mean small. The town we live in has a population of over a little of 500 people)

He then went on to say what had happened. She couldn’t remember anything. Their names, how to work the till, computer, etc. After our phone call ended I immediately left to drive where she worked. -I only lived about 20 minutes from here-
After I left I called the nurse hotline and told the gal her symptoms. She told me that I should call 911, because the symptoms I gave her basically said that she had a stroke/seizure. 

When I arrived at my moms work place she snapped out of what she called an “episode”

My boss and I asked her if she would, please, go to the hospital and get checked out. She reluctantly agreed.

We made our way to a Mayo Clinic. I’ll spare some boring details, but I left, came back and saw my mom in tears with the nurse beside her.

The first thing the nurse said was.. “Do you want to tell her or would you like me to?”

My mom broke down in tears and I was told she had brain cancer.

My dad is dying,80,fn9ivs,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/fn9ivs/my_dad_is_dying/,15,1584948259.0,"I wrote this on r/offmychest as well

I can’t think well. Just need some support 


About a month ago, my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. He also has diabetes, his kidneys are working only 20-30 percent, and has heart problems. 

Because of the corona situation, dad was discharged from the hospital without any warning. We received no help, no medical assistance, no help to transport him to doctor visits absolutely nothing. Dad is the only financial breadwinner of family so we are running out of money too. 

But it didn’t matter. I was happy to see dad again, but everytime I saw him in pain, every time I saw him struggling to breathe, I felt like a part of me was dying too. When I was sick, when I was scared, I ran to my dad for comfort. Every night before I went to sleep, I always hugged and kissed my parents even if others made fun of me. I’m 26 and I have no shame showing my parents love. Because they are my greatest blessings in life. Now, the person I love the most is in so much pain, and there’s nothing I, a useless daughter can do. 

Dad went back to the emergency room on Friday night as his sugar level was extremely low and it wasn’t going back up. He needed blood which we also didn’t realize. And every day his condition is getting worse. Every night I am so scared to sleep because I’m so afraid to wake up the night day and hear dad isn’t there anymore

My happiest memory, my happiest moment was being my dad’s daughter. If I were to be reborn, I want to be his daughter again. I can’t explain how much I love my dad. Even when he was sick, he was trying to pay off my student loan, even at his most painful moment, he was thinking of me

It would have been better if it was me who was sick. I would gladly give my life if it meant that my dad could live 20 more years. They say that a parent should never have to bury their child but their kids shouldn’t also have to bury their parents even if it’s a natural process of life.

The time I have left with my dad is short and the pain in my heart feels like it will burst my heart open. 

I can’t even see my dad because my immune system is compromised and my dad doesn’t want me to be sick. I’m such a useless daughter, I couldn’t even graduate on time

I wanted my dad to see my get my diploma, I wanted him to be the first person to know I got my first job, I wanted to hug and kiss him before going to sleep even at the age of 30, I wanted him to walk me down the aisle when I get married

My dad is dying and so is a part of me.",2020-03-23 07:24:19

It is becoming very apparent that my Dad is nearing the end of his short battle with cancer. I don’t know how much time he has left, weeks maybe at the most. It hurts my heart to know that he won’t be around much longer.  

His health has been in decline for awhile. Decreased mobility, incontinence issues, muscle weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss. He started needing to use a catheter to go to the bathroom in October 2019. Two days after this past Christmas he was admitted to the hospital with the flu. He spent a week in the hospital then came home for a couple days, but it was very clear he wasn’t getting better. He was admitted back to the hospital for infection and they did a CT scan and found the tumor. It was a 7cm tumor in his bladder. This was early January, just over a month ago. 

He was released to a rehab facility to get himself stronger to be eligible for surgery and chemo. We had such hope that he could build up some strength. His doctors and oncologist kept giving us hope that he would get better if he could just eat more, or just do a little more PT. But week after week, he keeps declining. 

He’s lost over 30 lbs since Christmas. He barely eats anymore, maybe a couple bites of each meal. He says that he’s simply not hungry. For awhile we tried to force him, but we have come to realize it’s no use. His body is shutting down.  

He is pretty much bedridden. He can still get himself out of bed, into a wheelchair and into a recliner, so he has some bit of strength left. But I have to remind myself that less than two months ago he was able to walk himself into the hospital. He’s also started sleeping more this past week. 

My mom is his main caregiver and she is absolutely devastated and overwhelmed and full of grief. It is so hard watching them both go through this. I’m also struggling myself because I am 7 months pregnant and really sad that my Dad will probably not be around to meet his granddaughter. The thought of death and birth occurring around the same time is so incredibly bittersweet. My emotions are all over the place.

PSA: Cancer has a mental health toll and you should treat that too,81,e9udpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/e9udpj/psa_cancer_has_a_mental_health_toll_and_you/,21,1576216873.0,"**tl;dr -** *cancer has a mental health and emotional toll, no matter where you are in treatment.  And it also can have a physical (brain chemistry) toll.  All of these factors can lead to, among other issues, depression.  And you should do something about that too.*

I finally went to see my PCP about some depression issues and I'm just really glad I did.  I already feel a weight lifted off my shoulders.  

**For background:**  It's been just about 5 years since I was DXed with stage 4 melanoma.  At the time, immunotherapy was (quite literally) reaching breakthrough status and would be approved for use in stage 4 patients.  When I was first diagnosed and knowing all those stats, I really felt I was going to die.  But, even after a year of unclean scans and then a recurrence 2 years ago, I have been very fortunate to be NED for just about 2 years now.  And rest assured, I am very happy and thankful.

But for the past almost year, I've just been feeling down.  Somewhere between blue and just really, really low.  Easily irritable.  Just so incredibly guilty (for a number of things, but including survival).  Unhappy and sometimes numb.  I didn't have any self-harm thoughts (I'm really happy to survive).  And finally, my wife spent the last 3 months or so urging me to do something about it.  

So finally, I called my PCP yesterday (yesterday!) after a particularly rough week and asked for an appointment and honestly, it was easy.  I spent the rest of yesterday just writing down all the things I was feeling and what they felt like and then explained them to him.  No judgment from him, just honesty. 

He stated that, among other things, it was possible that the possibly years of cancer-induced stress and crisis might have negatively impacted my brain chemistry.  And never mind the fact that it could be other physiological factors but also the pretty significant trauma of cancer itself (and probably confronting my own mortality).  

We discussed options and decided on both drug and therapist treatments as a means to figure it out.  I'm working through all that stuff now.  I should have done this way earlier.  And I feel like I owe this community a (probably another) reminder.  No matter where you are in the treatment process, you're more than just cancer treatment, you've got to treat your whole self.",2019-12-13 06:01:13

And if it's not the same cancer, then all the radiation causes some new cancer 10 years down the line. There is no Hallmark movie going on here. 

And people, they ask, ""are you in remission?"" And I think: maybe; maybe not. How would I know today? I'm not willing to commit to anything because things can change... just like that and I'm just trying to get through today, thank you very much. 

But, you know, what people want to hear is: you're in remission!, God loved you best! Your life is *better*, that's right, even *better* than it was before and cancer has made you a better, *stronger* person! You're a warrior! And a survivor! You inspire them! 

I ran into my former veterinarian while trying to quickly shop at Wally World last week. He said I looked great! Asked if I was in remission. When I said I wasn't ready to commit to this (*because I had literally just left the oncologists office where he gave me a long speech about how yearly PET scans don't change the outcome they just make you go on chemo regimens sooner and you still die anyway in the end, so why not have a nicer quality of life for 5 years?*) he informed me I would outlive him and argued with me about why I was surely in remission.

The worst experience since diagnosis wasn’t from the cancer; it was the medicine,83,b4t8w5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/b4t8w5/the_worst_experience_since_diagnosis_wasnt_from/,40,1553436986.0,"Last year, while taking chemo, I had some constipation issues with an anti-nausea drug called ondansetron. The doctor gave me another anti-nausea called compazine. 

I started to experience the worst feeling I have ever had. I couldn’t sit still enough to get sleep at night. I would walk around my room late into the night debating whether or not to wake my mom from the couch in my apartment. I would spend hours crying to her telling her how awful I felt. But I could never pinpoint what was wrong. The anxiety and restlessness came to a degree that I had never experienced. Existing felt torturous. I wish I was exaggerating. 

I remember once when I went out to dinner with my mom and sister. The sun was shining and we were sitting outside. I was excited to get out of the house because of this feeling of restlessness. But the second we sat down I felt trapped and restricted and cried to my family that we needed to leave. 

I was seeing a counselor already for an issue related to my anxiety, so I feared that this was an amplification of my preexisting anxiety. I went to my counselor to discuss anxiety medication, so she referred me to her colleague, a psychiatrist. While she was checking the drugs that I was taking she came across a side effect from compazine: akathisia. The second that I stopped taking compazine, the symptoms were gone. 

So I thought I’d pass on some of my chemo wisdom: Trust yourself! You know when something is really wrong. Tell your doctor about any abnormal feeling or side effect.
I felt like the restlessness was too trivial of a thing to mention to my oncologist because it was mental health, and seemingly unrelated to my treatment of cancer. I also am very grateful that that psychiatrist was able to diagnose the issue so quickly. It felt like she was an angel. If you are going through chemo, consider seeing a counselor. Mental health is just as important as physical health.

"Difficult situation, would appreciate help from those also with incurable cancers",79,apat9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/apat9v/difficult_situation_would_appreciate_help_from/,47,1549876156.0,"Hey. So I've posted here a few times before. General gist is I got diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer a couple months ago, aged 23. It's in my lungs and it's pretty bad. Right from the start they said that it was incurable and that I'd be getting treatment for the rest of my life. I started on a round of chemo (which was light and thus did not impact my life much at all) but a recent CT scan shows that this chemo has had little effect. There is an option of massive surgery but my surgeon only wants to do that if my life suddenly becomes at risk, it wouldn't be healing me, it'd be keeping me alive and since it'd be so intense they only want to do it if its absolutely necessary. 

So. My difficult situation. My doctors said that I could try a further round of chemo, but this would be the intense, hair-removing, highly destructive stuff that would impact my quality of life a lot. My doctor also said that this last-ditch chemo option had a less than 10% chance of actually working. It might just make my last few months extremely horrible with no reward. My other option is to do nothing and simply enjoy what time I have left, with my doctors working to alleviate pressure from symptoms. I'm currently doing pretty good so far, you wouldn't even think I'd caught a cold this past year.

I am aware that this is the sort of situation where this is no right answer. There's simply picking the option that is best for you. But I really don't know. I want to live more than anything. But chemo is terrifying, and I hate being sick, I just want to be unconscious when I don't feel good, and I wouldn't ever finish chemo and go back to my old life. It'd just be accepting being very ill as a stage of life before I die. And that's if it works. It's more likely that it won't work and I'll just add more misery onto my life before I die. But I say that and I still want to do it because I don't want to die even though I'm gonna hate life the whole time. The option of doing nothing is something I am considering, because I know I can't cheat an early death, but I find the thought of just sitting there and not doing anything to combat the illness inside me extremely difficult. I genuinely would try doing essential oils or something just as a little sanity-restoring thing if I went with that option. So far with my treatment I've been... holidaying, essentially, I've been seeing friends and watching a lot of tv and spending time with my family. I've really enjoyed this break from adult life in a weird way. I don't want to give that freedom up for chemo. I read a blog from a woman in her thirties who was diagnosed with incurable cancer, fought it with chemo a bit and got a few more years that way but eventually called it quits. The fact that she tried makes me feel like I have to try. I feel like there's this pressure on me to fight (everyone everywhere tells you to fight cancer and that's great and all but I already lost my fight guys) and it goes against a lot to just say, no, I'm not doing that. 

My one vague compromise is to do nothing, enjoy what time I have left, and when I get hospitalised or ill enough that I can't enjoy my life as I did before, then I try the chemo. Because at that point I won't be getting better no matter what I do. I kind of feel like I'm just being a coward though. Too scared to consent to the chemo that realistically will not work. But truthfully, the kind of life that a cancer patient lives - going through chemo with limited strength and no hair and a hundred horrible side-effects from treatment - I don't want to live like that. Idk. I know there isn't really a question here but it's just a bit sad. I would really appreciate hearing from others in my position or from those who are familiar with this sort of situation. The classic cancer story is ""I had this disease and I fought it and I won/lost"" there isn't really any discussion around people who have already lost. 

Edit: I guess, and this is me just being vaguely curious, what would you do if you were in my position? ",2019-02-11 09:09:16

In September 2015, she was diagnosed with Stage IV adenocarcinoma, a 7-centimeter tumor in her left lung and small specks of cancer in her right. She was only given eight months to live. 

By God’s grace, genetically she was a candidate for a clinical trial drug called Tarceva that stabilized the cancer for many months. We had all hoped the drug would shrink the tumor, but it only stopped it for a while. “Stable is a positive in our world,” the oncologist had said. 

In summer 2016, Tarceva stopped working and she began traditional chemotherapy. We were back on our eight-month timeline. I was at many of her infusions.

But there is no cure for Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Treatments only give you more time.

Mom had time to go on one last trip with each of her kids. My two sisters went to Mexico with her. My brother to Colorado. And I, at the final hour, in February 2017, went with her to San Francisco and Yosemite.

I was there with mom at the hospital for many of the downturns. When she had her needle biopsy and they staged the cancer and mom found out it was going to kill her. When Tarceva didn’t shrink but only stabilized the tumor. When the oncologist said all the treatment options had failed and the best chance for quality of life in the time she had left was to go home into hospice care and let cancer go.

I asked him how much time she had. He said, “Weeks to months.” If you’re counting, that’s two to eight weeks.

Mom lasted six.

I remember the first day she was home in hospice. One of her girl friends come over to visit. Mom talked with her for an hour, going on about this and that. I sat in a room off to the side listening to her talk, not the words, just the sound of her talking, and it was so pleasant remembering all the times as a kid growing up and listening to her talk on the phone with her friends.

She lost a lot of weight. She made it to her sixtieth birthday. In the end, she was a breathing skeleton. She started hallucinating. And in the last two weeks, she became less and less responsive. She spent her last three days sitting in a padded recliner with her arms folded on a desk in front of her and her head down. I think it was the only position that opened up her chest cavity to allow her to get enough Oxygen. 

An hour before her death, her breathing changed to a series of brief sniffs.

A minute before she died, I heard the sniffs catching in the back of her throat, and I knew the air wasn’t getting to her lungs. I told the rest of the family, “This is it.”

The five of us were there. I held her two hands in front. My brother was on her right. My sister was on her left. My dad and my other sister huddled over her further to the left. It was hard to tell when she took her last breath, but at some point, one of my sisters said, “I think she’s gone.”

When she died, everyone cried out loud; I remember specifically my dad and my brother, though.

But I didn’t. I went for a walk around the lake and my legs buckled beneath me every few steps.

I loved my mom.

All the people who knew and loved my family, some knew better than others, that there’s a sadness among our family that’s deeper than death and cancer. And the hurt is this: Decades of not-talked-about hurt and coldness and distance and missed conversations and lost time between my dad and mom. Loss of husband-wife warmth and relationship, all lived out under one roof but never reconciled. It was the bigger tragedy.

I was sitting beside my mom, just us two, when the oncologist told her it was time to go home into hospice. Dad came in and mom told him. I remember he audibly choked back a sob, then he kissed her on the forehead, choked back another sob, and kissed her on the forehead again.

After all the years of him keeping his emotions inside a fortress, I was shocked, *shocked* to see him cry.

I wish none of this had ever happened. I wish mom and dad had loved each other and been truly happy. I wish mom had never gotten cancer. I wish she hadn’t died. It never had to end this way.",2018-05-23 20:25:48
Wife Passed Away on Christmas Eve,83,5kaem0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/5kaem0/wife_passed_away_on_christmas_eve/,33,1482732372.0,"At 7:04 PM, my wife died at home with me by her side, marking an end to her two year fight with brain tumors.

She was in hospice for a month, choosing to have care at home and discontinue the Avastin regimen, along with the new addition of Opdivo.  

The former was no longer effective against the grade iv glioblastoma, based on renewed growth from two mri scans.  As for the Opdivo, she couldn't tolerate the side effects.

The last week marked noticeable change in her physical & mental states.  On Sunday, she stopped her maintenance medications (comfort drugs excepted).  Wednesday, she stopped eating and drinking.  Thursday was the last time she spoke.  Friday, she stared off into space, still aware by virtue of squeezing my hand on command.

Saturday was a continuation of Friday until mid-afternoon, when she was breathing rapidly and had a pulse of 145.  That ceased at 7:04, when she gave shallow gasps, and eventually stopped. 

She is finally at peace.  Me?  I'm working on it.  Reading about the progression of the disease is no match for seeing first hand with a loved one.

I didn't recognize my dad,82,hwhdry,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/hwhdry/i_didnt_recognize_my_dad/,26,1595546055.0,"My dad was diagnosed with a retroperitoneal liposarcoma which is a rare fatty tissue cancer (less than 1% in adults) back in April after experiencing a fever and abdominal pain.

&nbsp;

I believe that when he was diagnosed it was already too late, his cancer had gone untreated for very long and the tumor had actually burst, which is why he had a fever. But we didn't know this back then. 

&nbsp;

He had surgery immediately after the diagnosis in April, but they couldn't get everything out. He went back home with my mom 3 weeks later and wasn't really careful enough and ate whatever he wanted, he had a bowel obstruction a couple of weeks later. 

&nbsp;

He was taken to a bigger hospital in June and had emergency surgery for the bowel obstruction. The main surgeon told us how bad it actually was and that he really thought he wasn't going to make it through the surgery. He was given 6 months to live in June. 

&nbsp;

This was awful to process, I don't live with my parents, I live and work in a different country so I couldn't just go see them whenever. But I was able to take two weeks off work from July 20 until July 31. HR was understanding. 

&nbsp;

He was put on a lot of painkillers after the second surgery, the recovery process was delicate but he was discharged and allowed to go into hospice at home on July 9 which was the only thing he wanted.

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, the painkillers he was prescribed for the home hospice weren't nearly as strong as the ones he was administered inside the hospital unit, nor was the administration as effective.

&nbsp;

He developed an infection during his home stay and his health declined very quickly. He was taken back to the first clinic in order to receive palliative/end-of-life care on July 14.

&nbsp;

It was finally time for me to take time off work and travel to go see him on Monday July 20. It was a long trip and I went to the clinic directly.

&nbsp;

My mom walked me to his room, I'll never forget the number N°206. When she opened the door I entered the room but my first reaction was to turn back because I thought my mom had made a mistake and I had walked into the wrong room.

&nbsp;

She looked at me wondering what I was doing, I looked back at her and all I could whisper was ""Is that him?"", ""Yes dear, that's him"", she said.

&nbsp;

I broke down like a literal child, I couldn't breathe, talk or even cry properly for a whole minute. He was barely conscious, his eyes were closed, he was pale and full of bruises, he was extremely skinny but the tumors had taken over his abdominal area. He could barely breathe through his wide open mouth. His face looked nothing like him, he was malnourished because he couldn't eat. I did not recognize my dad. He had no life left in him.

&nbsp;

But, somehow, when I called his name and said it was me he mustered up enough strength to open his eyes and lightly smile as if he was telling me that he heard me and that he was happy to see me. I told him I loved him, I thanked him for everything he has done for me and I promised him I was going to be strong for myself and for my mom.

&nbsp;

I told him it was okay if he wanted to rest, I told him it was okay to let go. He was heavily sedated on both a strong benzodiapezine and morphine, so I don't know if he actually processed or remembered anything. But I like to believe so.

&nbsp;

Me and my mom went back home and I cried my eyes out until I went to bed. My mother has surprisingly been handling the whole thing very well. I was the one who was a mess.

&nbsp;

The next morning, on Tuesday, my mom got a call at 11:45am. My dad passed away peacefully and without pain on Tuesday, July 21 2020 at 11:40am. The doctors say he waited until I got there to let go. I hope it's true. I am still very sad.

Letting it all out,76,h8y15m,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/h8y15m/letting_it_all_out/,19,1592184997.0,"If you’re reading this, it’s sort of my confession. I’m breaking down, I am 19 years old and I have metastatic Ewing sarcoma, which is an awful cancer to deal with. In front of my family I have remained strong for so long but today I woke up and broke down. The idea of death scares me, not dying, but seeing all my friends and family before I go. Seeing the faces of all them not knowing what to say to me to possibly comfort me, I love them all so much. That’s my biggest fear, knowing my two sisters and brother are losing their youngest sibling. It’s not supposed to work like that. I pray that if I go my mother, father, and all my siblings find the strength to keep going, I do not know if I believe in the cliche of “I will always be with you” because what if I’m not allowed to be. I hate the pain, I hate the words that come from the doctors, I hate this horrific disease, and I hate feeling like nothing. Today I’m in a lot of pain, and the pain turns my mind into a dark place. Recently I started talking to a girl, the worst part is, this girl matches my personality to a T. Sometimes it’s like I’m talking to myself, I may be young, but I have talked to a lot of different girls (I don’t mean for that to come off sounding like a prick).
We’ve spent nights with eachother and it has only been a month, I wasn’t ever expecting this while going through treatment, and it just pulls at my heart strings even more. Everyday, I hope and pray that treatment works and one day I’ll live cancer free. As a reminder on days like this, I always tell myself of the times I have died during this two year journey, and how many times I picked myself right back up and did not let it defeat me.

Edit: I just want to say thanks for all of the support, I was at a low point when I wrote this, and I appreciate the love and understanding of all of you. I hope you all have a good day/night :)",2020-06-15 01:36:37

"Yep, it’s cancer",78,fizx6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/fizx6l/yep_its_cancer/,25,1584300193.0,"TL;DR - got cancer, it sucks, it hurts, what should I do?

It’s been ... not great for the past weeks. Biopsy came back and my oncologist was spot on: myxoid liposarcoma, stage IV, already tiny bits in the spinal connectivity tissue (not the proper spine?).

It’s been a few days. Diagnosis was delayed because trying to get the radiation mapping done took forever because it hurt the absolute living shit out of me. Finally, I had to refuse treatment again, and the radiologist said we should focus on other avenues of treatment.

Only thing that makes me mad is that we had a clear plan on breaking out the pain meds to get me to the end, like planned to the minute, and none of the radiology team followed through. This was Friday evening, so haven’t had a chance to talk to them about it, but do you all think it’s something to pursue?

Also now have a really big cavity in the back of my thigh, near to where my tumor was/is, oozing lots of blood, not bleeding out, just oozing. They’re keeping it stuffed with gauze right now. Needs to be changed at least twice a day; doesn’t *hurt*, but is rather unpleasant. And also prevents me from continuing my chemo. So now that’s sitting in the back of my head and pit of my stomach.

Emotionally, I think I’m doing OK. Need to make some plans, want to visit with extended family and old friends, but stupid dumb virus is screwing that up. One thing I want to do is setup something for my two nieces, no idea what it would look like, but a couple of presents or something in the mail every year, birthday and Christmas? Don’t know if there’s something like that on the Internet.

By the time my doctors could find out what as going on, it had already exited my thigh and ""landed"" in my spinal column. One part in particular, the L5, was enlarged enough to seem to block at least some of the treatment, so my doctors tried to focus on shrinking that tumor in particular to alleviate the massive amount of pain I have experienced. My doctors' have determined that shrinking the L5 via radiation is not the best path to go on, and will be meeting on Monday to determine a better way.

Also I have already done two rounds of chemo, one on ATM, the latest on trabectedine. Three more I think? Latest plan was to continue on with the trabectedine, but that might have changed.

At the same time, in the back upper part of my thigh, a cavity developed that won’t embolize. So far, the only way to stop the bleed has been to wipe out the cavity, then stuff it with kerlix gauze and the put in a few sutures or tape to hold it together.

I know that I probably don’t have a lot of time, and I need to start making plans for visiting family and friends for the last time, right? But I can’t do that with this thigh thing hanging over me. So, what can I do?

Please people of Reddit, help me. I really need all the help you can give me!",2020-03-15 19:23:13

It was soul crushing but she fought. 
 Chemo was every other week for a year and half, then surgery to remove the right lobe of her liver, still she fought it. After the surgery we finally got good news, it seemed that the main tumor had shrunk away and the lung biopsy had come back as a negative, we celebrated. 

The week before our 3 year anniversary she said she didn't feel good, so more tests. We got the call on our 3rd anniversary that it had come back and spread, it was larger in her lungs and now had spread into her lymph nodes. That was 6 months ago. For the better part of 3 years she has had chemos, surgery's, and scans, almost every week. 

Today she wants to give up. I hate it, I hate that through all of this where she has fought so hard that her resolve had broken. I hate that nothing we do seems to work. I hate that I have said so many things and we have talked about so much of our future and now it may not happen.

All I can think about is how this is effecting me, how will I deal with it and I yelled at her today because of it, in over 10 years of dating and marriage have never raised my voice at her in anger until today, until she gave io and I hate myself for it and now she hates me and there is nothing I can do to take it back. I don't even know if anyone is still reading this but I just needed to say it, I think I need help but I don't know where to go or who to even talk to. I am the bad guy here so I don't even know if I deserve to get help.



EDIT

I just want to say thank you to everyone who has reached out on here and messaged me or commented. I really wasnt expecting anyone to even really read this, let alone have other people pour out their hearts as well. It's odd to say it like this, but it's nice to know I'm not alone even though this is a really shitty thing that I wouldn't wish on anyone. 

We had a talk last night and this morning and she is going to at least finish out this clinical trial she is on and at her appointment Monday im going to talk to someone about help for me. 

Thank you all again for helping me, and if I can do anything for any of you I will. Stay strong",2018-10-27 02:22:01

I have my 3rd PET scan on 10/29.  My previous two PET scans revealed that my cancer wasn't present so everyone is hoping that it has completely left my body.

Anyway, a few people here were really helpful in the early stages of my diagnosis so I just wanted to come out and share the good news that I'm all done, doing fine, and things are finally starting to look up.

I am happy to answer any questions you may have.  Thank you all for your help, kind words, and support during this difficult time of my life.",2017-10-17 22:43:59
Just Diagnosed With Stage 4 Glioblastoma (Brain Cancer),81,76sdrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/76sdrl/just_diagnosed_with_stage_4_glioblastoma_brain/,38,1508206290.0,"Hey /r/cancer!

I guess I'll start with a [few pics](https://imgur.com/a/U67Aw)

And some now that I'm [looking almost normal!](https://imgur.com/a/RloXM)

Ok so I'm a bit new here! And I've been lurking reddit hard for years. I'll start off with a brief synopsis of my story. 

About 6 months ago I was having severe ""migraines"" (read orange sized tumor pushing on my brain). I was in and out of the doctor, no CT or MRI. I also started exhibiting vertigo, nausea and vomiting. My neurosurgeon informed me these were basic identifiers for brain cancer. But doctors are people too and stuff gets missed, life goes on. 

On Tuesday the 26th around 7 p.m. I was walking my dog, got severe ""vertigo"" and fell to my left side. A guy helped me up onto a tree and I was able to text my girlfriend for help. We went to the ER immediately. Within about an hour (after a quick CT scan! Then MRI) I was being shown the MRI and told I most likely had a Stage IV Glioblastoma and needed to have brain surgery. As you can see in the MRI it is located in the left hemisphere and was actually pushing on my left side which is why I fell that way.

On Friday September 29th I was in surgery for about 5 hours. The resection went very well, there is no ""curing"" this cancer, it is created by the glue in my brain. Hopefully they can learn something from me. They put in 8 chemotherapy wafers in the newly created hole in my brain that will hopefully help kill off some of the leftover ""nasty bits"" as we call them.

Post-Op is going well. I'm gaming, cubing, working a little (programming), moving around more, and trying to find projects to take on to keep busy. Overall I feel very positive that I'll get through this first year and we will go from there. I am very lucky to have a very strong family and support system, they have truly made this bearable. 

Anyways, just wanted to introduce myself! I'm sure I'll need all the support I can get! I wonder if there's a Glioblastoma/Brain Cancer group or club out there?

(I do have 2 brain surgery pics if you guys want to see them)

**Peace and Love to all!!!!
Smile!**

I just need someone to listen,79,dl09x9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/dl09x9/i_just_need_someone_to_listen/,29,1571691980.0,"Cancer has ruined everything. 

Last Christmas my mom was complaining of pain in her midsection that kept growing worse. An ER visit said it was probably muscle pain, gave her a lidocaine patch, and referred her to her GP. He ran some bloodwork and concurred he thought it was muscle pain. 

It came back in January. Another ER trip. Some scans showed something in the liver, so she was referred to my dad's oncologist (dad is as close to being in remission from esophageal cancer as possible) who began to run tests. Nothing conclusive. More scans. More bloodwork. DNA testing on the biopsy. They found a mass in her liver, spots on her lungs and stomach. 

DNA tests inconclusive. Eventually she was diagnosed with stage 4 neuroendocrine cancer that had spread to her liver, lungs, and stomach. She got started on chemo, but didn't react to it well. Exhausted all the time, not just the few days after treatment. Couldn't eat anything, no appetite, constant coughing and vomiting up what little she managed to eat. Her doctor suggested immunotherapy instead, and after a long battle with the insurance company she was able to begin receiving that.

She also received brachytherapy to reduce the size of the liver mass. It did, a bit, but didn't really relieve her symptoms at all. 

I live in a different country from my parents, so last week my husband and I went for a long-planned visit. My mom landed in hospital the day before we got there, so we spent much of the visit in hospital hanging out with her. She was in extreme pain due to a tumour in her spine pressing on the nerves and bone, and the oncology team suggested radiation therapy to reduce the size of it and give her some relief. But she didn't want to do that because it hurt too much to be on the rad table. She was on IV morphine and hydrocodone, but when they offered to up her medication she refused--part of it is that her brother died of a self-induced opioid overdose about 15 years ago, and the other part is that she's growing increasingly paranoid.

She's afraid the nurses are trying to ""get rid of her,"" she's afraid the doctors are trying to off her, even when the Eucharistic minister from church visited it was ""he makes me feel like I'm on my way out."" She won't talk to me or my dad, and only briefly to a social worker--saying she's afraid, basically. 

But the thing is, she's declining so quickly that it feels like she is ""on her way out,"" in her phrasing. My dad thinks there's a distinct possibility she won't see Christmas/New Year's. She had to be catheterized the other day because she is having trouble passing urine. My dad desperately wants her to be home, but my mom is almost reluctant to come home. She'll need a hospital bed at home, and my mom is afraid she'll be a burden. 

My husband and I are back at home in our country, and it's killing me each day. I'm just waiting for the call that say she doesn't have much time left, and to come quick. My dad spoke to my husband about it, but not to me, because our family is definitely a This Is Hard, Let's Not Talk About It family. I'm genuinely running distracted, my mind is totally elsewhere, and this is just crushing. 

Thanks for reading. I don't have any friends who have gone through this before, or who have even lost a parent, so they don't really understand. My husband is right here in the thick of it with me, and we're all struggling together.",2019-10-21 21:06:20

It doesn't help that people my age are usually busy with their lives (career/socialising) , I can't join them for the usual outings anymore (eating out, bars, physical activities, normal 25 yo stuff etc) because I'm still having treatment. Its been months since I've seen anyone in person. 

They use to check in and hang out with me after the first few sessions but as time went on I notice they didnt even bother asking anymore, maybe because I always told them I was fine after the first few chemo sessions so they kinda assumed Im still fine now?

But it still kinda hurts that nobody bothers to drop by/check in anymore, worst thing is I know everyone still hangs out with each other occasionally just without me (they're open about it so its not behind my back). I'd have mixed feelings if they threw me a party for completing my treatments because I can't shake this feeling of abandonment. 

Am I just overthinking this, can't help feeling Im being selfish :/

Ps. I have a very supportive family so it's not all bad.

They are reducing the dosage on my chemo because of the side effects.  I said no I don't want to but they ""have to"" because it's protocol.  So I'm fucking dying but managing diarrhea is more important?

My mom passed away today after a long, painful fight with cervical cancer. I was with her this fall quarter as I had taken this quarter off from college to become her caretaker. After she passed, I cried a little when I saw my relatives were also crying. I was also crying because I regretted not being at the hospital by her side when she was passing. I regretted not telling her I loved her when she was still conscious and able to think. I said goodbye to her when she was unconscious but it pained me because I wanted to know that she knew what I said. Like I know hearing is the last senses to go, but did she really know that I really, really loved her? I wanted to go after work (night) and stay by her side overnight but she was gone so fast. But now, I can't really cry. The drive home, no tears came. When I was working, no tears came. I think I just feel numb but I don't know why. I feel like my brain hasn't really processed it but rather it is trying to not thinking about it.

Because my mom passed, I'll resume college this winter quarter. However, I'm scared about how I will ""react"" or ""feel"". Would i be crying all of a sudden? Would my focus be totally diminished because of this event?

I've never experienced a loss of a loved one and of the most important person. She was a single mother who raised my siblings and I, so she was the only person that had supported and loved me my whole entire life. It hurts me when she was alive and asked the doctor to do whatever they can so she can at least see me graduate. Now she can't, and she won't be able to see my future children or watch me get married.  I'm also afraid of losing the sound of her voice. What should I expect after her death? What can I do to take care of myself? I don't know if I'm allowed to ask those questions, but I'm totally lost right now. Thanks",2018-12-10 18:01:03

Update on my wife who had advanced bowel cancer at 34 years old,79,5ssd91,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/5ssd91/update_on_my_wife_who_had_advanced_bowel_cancer/,12,1486585082.0,"Hi all,

It has been a while since I was last on here. I think I posted at the beginning of my wifes diagnosis which was in June or just into July (2015). We have been through a massive journey and one which everything will probably now stay with me until the day I die.

My late wife was first diagnosed with secondary bowel cancer after being misdiagnosed for three months and by the time the tests were done, it was too late. It was terminal (stage 4) and uncurable.

In the end she had cancer in her bowel, three quarters of her liver, light particles in her abdomen, both lungs and in her bones. She had pains in her hip for 2 to 3 months towards the end and our Dr said it was extremely rare that bowel cancer spreads to the bones and kept refusing to do any form of scan at the time. Well turns out it was the cancer and was on the brink of fracturing her hip as it had indeed spread through her bone structures (and even through chemo) that she had to rushed into hospital and have a hip replacement....at the age of 34!

A day and half later she was discharged from hospital and allowed to come home. No physio, just crutches to take home. Oh they did get bed heighteners installed in our home as well as toilet heighteners and a tall backed chair. And that's when it all just sped up. She had fluid fast growing in her stomach and legs and she was ballooned up so badly she looked like she was pregnant. I was told she had Ascites in her liver so that was no longer functioning. Every 2 to 3 days, in and out of hospital, drained, back at home to rest, then do it all again a few days later. In between was blood transfusions and it completely took it's toll in the end. The night before she passed away, they put a drain in to allow us to drain the fluid ourselves.

Well the next morning after the drain was put in, she started having chest pains and breathlessness and slowly started forgetting things and becoming more and more agitated. I phoned 911 to ask for help and eventually demanded an ambulance due to her condition worsening. When the paramedics arrived she closed her eyes and started screaming for people to help her and was like this throughout the rest of the day. I can still hear her screaming out. Almost haunting in a way. It was almost like my wife had dementia within 24 hours as she didn't know who anyone was, not even me, which is the most upsetting thing about it all.

I contacted as many people and allowed all of my wife's friends to come and pay their respects before she passed and think they all appreciated that and am sure she would have also.

She sadly died at around 11.14pm that night. She took her final few breaths of life and then...nothing. I was slumped over the hospital bed like a broken man and still am to an extent. I am now a widowed father of two children, both 8 and 10 years old at the age of 36. People say 'time is a great healer', 'it will get easier', 'I know how you are feeling'. Do you really? Honestly? This coming just 2 months after I was made redundant from my job after 8 and half years. How does someone pick themselves up after so much devastation and in such a small time frame?

It is now just over four months since the funeral and feels like it was just yesterday. I have good'ish days and some bad days. I walk out and about sometimes staring into the distance like i'm not even on this planet. I'm somewhere else. Sometimes I will just sit and look at where she used to sit or imagine she is just about to come in from work.

The day of the funeral for me was probably the hardest day I will ever encounter. Seeing the hearse pull up outside our family home with 'mummy' in the window made up of her favourite flowers and the very slow drive towards the crematorium.

I am now going through counseling after deciding enough is enough as my health was getting worse and worse from the stress and anxiety as I had pretty much gone from being her husband to just her carer. So much so, I thought I had bowel and stomach cancer as I became symptomatic but this has now all been cleared with tests etc. A massive weight from my mind but still on anxiety medication to help me get through the days ahead. Now my two young children, 8 and 10 years old are now going to go to counseling to get them through the pain. Although they appear to be fine, I'm sure they are holding it back for my sake.

I'm just so grateful I have such amazing family and friends who have all been so supportive and can't ever thank them enough.

I made a promise to my wife that I would continue and do the best for our children. The hardest thing was it being so close to Christmas and I had no interest at all which is unlike me as I usually love that time of the year, especially for the children. I did my up most to make it as special as I could for my two children. It was their first Christmas without their mummy. It was very difficult but being around our family really helped the three of us through the pain.

We have since scattered her ashes across a few of her favourite places including Paphos Harbour where we got married just over 12 years ago and was lovely to finish our journey together as that is where our journey together began.

If there is any good out of all of this, my wife is no longer suffering and in pain and is now resting in peace wherever that is. Sleep tight sweetheart.

For every person and their loved ones who are going through a cancer related illness...stay strong, think positively and make each day truly count. Thanks for listening.",2017-02-08 20:18:02

I HAVENT TURNED 25 YET! And I live in a country with excellent health care and all of that crap that I’m so grateful for.. BUT! NOBODY told me how many things could effect my economy with treatment. Like spending over 100 dollars a month on JUST special toothpaste, stuff for spit production, and fucking soaps and creams because you aren’t supposed to use ... SOAP? 
I’m so sad because everyone keeps saying I deserve to relax, but HOW do you relax when steroids made fucking sure NOTHING fits, NOTHING tastes okay, and hey - why not add the amazing cost of ENORMOUS FUCKING BANDAIDS AND BANDAGES because you NEEED to change them, but we’re not fucking paying for it? Like I have spent obnoxious amounts of money on this stuff. My stomach is in knots because Christmas is giving me anxiety. 
At this point I’m praying for me to win the lottery. For me - but also so I can set up every single person in my life that has held me somewhat afloat the last 7 months. I am exhausted. Absolutely exhausted.

It's an hour and a half away.  Why was I working.  I knew she was in the hospital of course but it was routine.  They said everything was fine.  They did a scan last night and they said no tumor growth, and that she was looking good.  Now her body is failing.  Jesus Christ, I didn't think it would happen so fast.  Why was I at work.  I should have been home.  I just started the job two months ago, I should have just stayed home.  I'm only 22 why do I have to lose my mom so quick.  I can't believe this is happening.  I'm sorry this is incoherent.  I need to just yell into the wind on the internet.  I joined this sub a year and a half ago when she was diagnosed.  I thought I'd have more time.  I can't believe this.

Edit: Thank you all for your kind words.  When I got here at the hospital, she was and still is totally out of it.  She has been for the past day.  Sometimes she opens her eyes and has the horrible look on her face.  I don't know if it's just all the pain killers, but it looks like utter fear.  It hurts so much.  I was hoping she'd be somewhat of mind, but she's out of it.  Doctors say this is the end.  It's just time now.  I can't believe this is happening.  I wish I saw her more.  I wish I never took the job.  I wish there was more time.  I want to cry so hard but I'm so tired of crying.  I could just pass out.  Again, thank you for your kind words, I would try to respond to all of you individually, but I'm just so tired and want to be with mom even if she doesn't know I'm here.  I would kill to know that she knows it.  Like I said she's opened her eyes, but I don't know if there's anyone behind those eyes.  I just want to hear her say ""I love you"" once more.  Jesus why is this happening

Edit 2:  It's 10:30pm local time, 11:30 my body's time.  Mom is still with us for now, but she's pretty much all gone mentally.  There's no room in the hospital for the whole family, so me and my brother are going home to my parents house to sleep while my dad and my mom's sister stay the night.  There was a moment where she had her eyes open and I told her I love her, and she kinda sighed out two ""syllables"" which kinda sounded like ""I love..."" before closing her eyes (she hasn't opened them since).  I don't know if she actually was trying to say ""I love you too,"" but telling myself she did helps me a lot.  I will be back tomorrow morning.  I really hope she doesn't pass while everyone is asleep.  I don't know if anyone is reading this anymore, but thank you if you are.  I'm basically using this Reddit post as a diary at this point.  I'll continue updating tomorrow.  For now I need to try to sleep.

Edit 3:  5:55 AM, May 24, 2019, my mother passed away.  I wasn't at the hospital.  I was asleep.  My dad was there though, and so was my mom's sister.  Dad said she went very peacefully.  I'm not ready for this.  My dad just came back and he's just in a whole different state right now.  No one knew that when they left to take her to the hospital for some minor pain that she'd never come home again.  Jesus Christ.  I think I'll probably keep updating this over the next few days.  It's helpful for me.  Hopefully someone reads all this.  I just can't believe it's over.  Just can't believe this.  I can't.  My god, she's gone.",2019-05-24 02:28:41

Lucy was.,80,bklkud,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/bklkud/lucy_was/,7,1557008220.0,"The cancer community, vast and ever-present, is one initially thrown together by circumstance; forged in fear and shaped by grief.  At first, we cling to one another in the desperate hope that being around those whose footsteps we blindly stumble in might somehow lessen the gravity of the burden we each carry so confusedly.

Lucy was a beacon.

No one was prepared for the journey, and all we can do is look to those travelling with us for some guidance, clinging to those rare and remarkable individuals who somehow illuminate the darkness with their own light.

But, like a lotus from the mud, something new and beautiful can grow; weaving its way unwaveringly and unapologetically skywards.  With love, patience and perseverance, our collective trauma (whilst still awful) can give life to the truly extrordianary.

Lucy was a gardener.

She planted the seed on October 16th 2018, bringing together a handful of people, myself included, in a Whatsapp group. Carving out a space online, she created somewhere within which we could be entirely vulnerable and upfront about the challenges we were facing as young cancer patients.

She tended to our seedling with a determination and commitment rarely witnessed in this vast and confusing thing we call existence, and it not only survived; it flourished.

More and more names were added to our circle, each bringing with them new insights and new struggles. Our daily conversations traversed the fathomless lows and mountainous highs of our individual lives; from the heartbreaking to the hilarious. Some even met in person, sharing these moments with the rest of us who looked longingly and lovingly on from behind our screens. Our lotus bloomed.

Lucy was a fighter.

I don’t mean just for animal rights nor conservation – about which she was fiercely passionate. I mean that, despite battling her own lymphoma cancer, which had first reared its ugly head in March 2018 and continued to bewilder and enrage us all with its reoccurrence, Lucy never faltered in her support for others.

Whether from a hospital bed, hooked up to any number of medications in that moment, or from her own home, curled up in her PJs and in beloved canine company, you always knew she would be there with words of encouragement, a sassy meme or simply to listen as you cried.

Lucy passed away last night.

Lucy,  you touched all of our lives in more ways than I can count. You brought light to the darkest of times. You made us smile when we feared we would never smile again. You shared your deepest truths with us, and in turn gave us the courage to share our own. You showed us love, and it was returned ten fold by each of us who were so glad that we had met you. We love you.

Lucy was a badass babe.
Lucy was our friend.
Lucy will live on in us.",2019-05-04 22:17:00

Every decision I have made has brought me to realize that there is no one else out there for me. Call it fate, call it god’s work or whatever; you are my all. I fully intend on growing old with you, but I am unable to know what the universe has in store for us so I figure I might as well tell you how I feel. I honestly don’t even know what to say. My love for you runs so deep that it cannot be physically measured in this lifetime or the next. My love for you creates an ache in my bones that is neither unpleasant nor enjoyable. My love for you is a life force, driving my every motivation, my every move. Our souls forever bound to one another. If we could recreate this life as different people, I am still convinced you and I would end up together. I didn’t know a love as deep as this was possible. Its as if the only way we can truly know love is by knowing suffering; deep immeasurable suffering. I wouldn’t change anything about our lives. You are my destiny. I want you to be happy. Honor my memory in the best way you know how, by doing unto others and carrying on the message of love, hope and courage, but do not sacrifice your happiness. If you can help *nephew* and *niece* to have a chance at a good life, invest in them. Their success would be the best way to honor my memory. Never give up the fight for social justice and never become complacent with the way things are. Vigilance is the price we pay for freedom and we should never take that for granted. I love you so very, very much.

&#x200B;

So, a few weeks ago my now 36 year old wife was diagnosed with stage 4 uterine cancer. It’s been a hard fight. We were already in the hospital when the diagnosed finally came through. We started off in a losing position and just didn’t know it yet. I am still her by her side, but we can’t even talk anymore other than a groggy eye blink here and there.

Our story starts long before this though. We’ve come to this realization during the long thoughts of why. April of last year she was hospitalized for anemia. She experienced heavy bleeding for a month, maybe more. She was given two units of blood as they thought that would stop the bleeding. And it did. She liked the doctor so much she continued to see her as her OYBG after the hospital stay. My wife ended up on birth control to control her hormones. And that was it.

And that was it. After talking about it over and over with friends, family, and friends of family, the best I’ve heard was that was a missed opportunity. She was very young, only 33 at the time, but had a couple of risk factors. Other than the heavy bleeding, though that alone maybe should have prompted a cancer screening. But it didn’t. It wasn’t even in our heads to force this issue or even bring it up.

Earlier this year she began complaining about back pain. Nothing too major. Around of April it began to hurt so much it was debilitating and she had pain in her front as well. It seemed like a UTI to her, she tried to self-treat a few days, but was quickly at her doctor’s office. They listed to her UTI concerns and gave her meds and sent her way. We ended up in the ER that weekend. Saw a nurse practitioner and tried to explain the past month of pain. My wife mentioned out the UTI symptoms seemed to be better maybe but her pain was getting worse. The NP focused on that asked her why was she in the ER if she was feeling better. Her conclusion was my wife fell or hurt herself without knowing. Even after she insisted that something felt wrong and was wondering if they could just scan something. They sent her home with muscle relaxers and ordered physical therapy. They did a culture for the UTI though, came back negative because there wasn’t one. I like to think of this as another missed opportunity.

She followed up the ER visit with her regular doctor, still seeking a scan or something, because this was wrong. He had no problem sending her to get one. Week later we were going over the results and she had an enlarged uterus. A follow up appointment was made with her OYBG. She was also sent for a CT scan, which at first she skipped because she at this time felt too weak. The pain was hard for her to deal with; everything they gave her did nothing. She also began experiencing extreme nausea and no longer had any appetite. She couldn’t get comfortable enough to sleep either and spent the nights pacing hoping the paid would subside enough so she could sit back down. Her OYBG took a biopsy and told her to go ahead and do the CT scan just in case. The follow up, no results. The biopsy had to be sent to another clinic for further testing. She had done the CT scan though and compared to the one they did when she was hospitalized in April. It looked bad. Her uterus was 10cm last year, now sitting at 24cm. She was referred to an Oncologist. April 24th was the first time Caner was said. She wasn’t diagnosed with it, but was seeing an Oncologist next.

We never made it to the Oncologist appointment. April 28th, just before midnight we went to the ER again. Pain, nausea, sleeplessness always getting worse. She was quickly admitted with acute kidney failure. They were barely working at all. It is possible the contrast they used for the CT scan compromised already struggling kidneys. Not great, but we were in the hospital now and dialysis was going to help.

The hospital was aware of all the other issues going on and added all the doctors who were already working on her case, including the Oncologist who stopped by the next day. He went over everything and referred to the growth or the mass frequently. In the end he said it had spread a little bit and the outcome did not look very good. We were still not full grasping what these words meant. This could have been the first time they could for given the heads up for stage 4 cancer. No he wanted to do a lymph node biopsy first. The first biopsy results still haven’t come back, I’m not sure it ever did. After three days they said the new biopsy was hard to diagnose. They said this could indicate it was rare. It? You could tell they wanted the results before the called it Cancer. They brought on another Oncologist who really wanted to start Chemo. The tumor was too large to operate and would put all of the surrounding organs at risk. But they need to know what to treat.

May 3rd, still awaiting results, she was having trouble breathing her blood pressure was getting low. They were adjusted medications trying to get a handle on it. Nothing worked awhile her blood pressure kept dropping. In the afternoon it got so bad she got moved to intensive care. Her breathing was very labored by now. They found a large blood clot in her lungs. The clot was pressing on her heart. They had found some in her legs earlier so she was already on blood thinners. She needed aggressive treatment now. They wanted to give her TPA. They problem was of course if her tumors were bleeding the treatment could cause her to bleed out. The doctor suggested a half dose and cross our figures. Bleeding risk was still there but also it might not work well enough. We gave her the medicine and crossed our figures. Doctor said it would be quick, and in 15 minutes my wife was able to breathe again and heart rate came down.  A day later she was out of the danger zone of bleeding out. Clots just don’t go away. Thank take time.

She was weak after that day. We were focused on getting her to eat, exercises to get her out of bed, and working her lungs so they don’t fail. We got our diagnosis. Endometrial adenocarcinoma. It wasn’t rare at all. It was hard to diagnose because it was aggressive and non-differentiating. So good news, we know what it was. Couldn’t start chemo with the way her vitals were. They wanted her out of the ICU. It took a week, but we were finally out May 10th. They still wanted to wait on Chemo; her hemoglobin levels were too low. Good news was they were going up every day. We had a goal and knew what was next. May 14th the day before her birthday she was told we could start Chemotherapy the next day. It had its risks and side effects. Did not help her kidneys still have not made a comeback. But the doctors could work around that. We were ready.

May 15th 4am she becomes non responsive. Over the next hour her heart stops five times. They have to put her on a respirator. Her mom got there quick. During the 5th cardiac arrest the doctor was telling this this was really bad and she was going to come back. We agreed that if she had another we would let her go. And like that she stabilized. The CPR team did great work they got the medicine in her that she needed. And she was stable, sedated with a breathing tube. They had her rest for the day. The blood clot in her lungs was making it hard for her to breathe deeply. There was concern over this, but she had treatments, exercises, and was on Oxygen. But the CO2 levels in her built up and turned her blood acidic, resulting in heart failure.

She has been critical, but stable ever sense. The day after they lowered her sedation to make sure she was still responsive. She was quick to look around, recognize voices, and give some hand squeezes if she wasn’t too tired. So I know she is still there. The doctors say that is good and bad. She is aware of what’s going on as we have to make decisions for her. And these decisions are hard. The oncologist doesn’t think she will recover enough to get chemo. The Pulmonary doctor says the breathing tube can’t come out because she can’t breathe deeply. Some doctors give us a little hope here and there. But they might just be being nice. Other doctors telling us that there is no chance and the sooner we stop treatment the better it is for her. And every day we wait gets worse and worse. That cancer is still in there destroying what it can.

Finally today we meet with the doctor that helped us get through the first blood clot. She was the best then and explaining everything. We had been hoping to hear from her again. She gathered us all up and sat down with us to explain the whole picture to us. Give us every bit of information and stitch it into place. So we can see just how sick she has become. What kind of life she could expect if we followed various paths. She spent a lot of time with us answering all our questions about why we couldn’t hope on one thing or another. She related with us on a personal level. She did point out that things happen and they could be proven wrong, but with all the information she saw and gave us. We won’t be moving passed where we are now. She was very good at explaining what happens if we want to focus on quality of life as well. We have a very good understanding on what next. She left us to talk and figure it out without any rush or hurry. It’s our decision to make when we are ready.

Part of this story I left out are all the people. Her mother, sister, father, step-mother, aunts and uncles.  An amazing amount of friends and coworkers. Each one of them remind me of how well loved she is.

We couldn’t so they decided to do a biopsy a week ago and we just found out that it’s an externally rare skin cancer. So rare that the doctors aren’t even sure how to treat it. We have to take her in to get some blood samples and an MRI. I’m in shock. I just can’t believe that something like this could happen to a toddler. A FUCKING TODDLER. We won’t even be able to explain to her what’s happening and why it’s happening. It’s impossible for her to understand. I’m so scared that it’s going to get worse.

Well... that was unexpected (from Austria to the hospital),74,9d805b,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/9d805b/well_that_was_unexpected_from_austria_to_the/,10,1536192474.0,"Hey everyone. So I was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma 5 months ago and I kinda feel like telling the story of how I found out I had cancer.

So, I’m in my senior year of high school, and HEAVILY involved in my school’s music program. I was a participant in the 3 choirs offered there, as a vocalist, arranger, and accompanist. In the past, I was in band and jazz band, both of which I had quit by the beginning of 12th grade in order to prepare for my auditions for a university music program.

Every 2 years, my high school music program goes to Europe. When I was in 10th grade, they went to Italy. I had planned to go, but I couldn’t due to the fact that my spinal surgery was scheduled to be RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE of the trip.

Flash forward 2 years, and we’re going to Austria for our music trip. There is NO WAY I’m not going on this. Austria is probably one of the most musically rich countries in the world.

About a week before I left for Austria, I got a bit sick with a cough and I noticed a pain in my side. The cough went away before the trip and the pain was manageable with Advil. My mom, who is a nurse, decided to let me go to Austria. We thought that, at worst, I had a costal condritis.

As much as I loved my trip in Europe (Munich in Germany, Salzburg and Vienna in Austria, and Prague in The Czech Republic - we performed, saw locations where The Sound Of Music was filmed, visited Mozart’s house, went to the salt mines in Salzburg, bought sheet music in Prague, and went to several musical performances), as it progressed, the pain in my side began to worsen. My side was swelling up and little spider veins began to trace my body. Once the pain became so unbearable that I was unable to sleep, I called my mom back in Canada. This was two days before the end of the trip. We decided that if the pain persisted, I would see a doctor in Prague. My mom also set up an appointment with my doctor back home for the day after I returned from Europe.

The next morning, I felt better, so I decided to wait to visit a doctor when I got home. But as the day progressed, my pain worsened.

The day we flew back was the worst day.  I was in excruciating pain the entire time and when I finally got home, I took a shower and went to bed.

The next day, my mom checked me out and noticed a painless lump on my back. A tumour. I didn’t know it at the time, but my mom did.

I went to see the doctor, who then sent me to get an xray. The xray revealed that I had fluid in my lungs (3.5 litres to be exact) and I was sent to the hospital.

A week later I was diagnosed with stage 4 rhabdo, an unusual cancer for someone my age (it usually appears in young children, more rarely it occurs in the oldest ages, being 18/19).

One day I was in Europe, walking around, singing, taking in the beautiful architecture, the next, I was in the hospital.

My friends called this “reverse WebMD”, since I thought what I had was a LOT milder than what I actually had.

And here I am 5 months later. I’m doing really well. My tumours have shrunk to the point where if someone who didn’t know my situation looked at my scans, they’d think they were normal.

Anyways, that’s my story. Feel free to leave yours below. :)",2018-09-06 00:07:54
Life Says: F*ck You,76,8j9dae,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/8j9dae/life_says_fck_you/,16,1526298034.0,"Can I just put something here? Without worry or fear that I'll be judged or rejected.

Look, I don't know what lies ahead for me. I was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer at the end of February this year after a bout of nightmarish stomach pain. I'm 28 years old. Asian. Gay. Male. 

Just let me whine, please. I'll be ok after. I'm not even the type to complain, really. Life gave me lemons from the very beginning--not just recently. I can ask why me over and over, but, in the end, who am I compared to everyone else? I'm not special. Just another ant delivering food to its colony. The better question is, why not me?

Sometimes I wonder if I'm being tested. That some omnipotent being is looking down on me, placing obstacles in my path, and just waiting with bated breath for me to crack. I won't crack though. The cancer will have to fight me until my very last breath. Until my body becomes etched with reminders of my condition. Until my breath becomes labored with exhaustion. Until my eyes become too heavy to open. I will not surrender. 

My life has tempered me like a sword. It wasn't easy being gay growing up. In fact, I tried to kill myself at the ripe age of 11 after a period of despondency from feeling rejected at school and at home. There was no way out at the time, it seemed, and euphoric fantasies of death lingered in my head. It felt less like jumping into something scary, and more like stepping into something warm and welcoming. 

Nothing happened, of course, and I never attempted again. Although passive thoughts have crossed my mind, I've made no plans though, so don't worry. Like I said, I'm a fighter now. 

There's a good chance I won't be around in five years. I know that statistic well because I think about it almost everyday. I suppose I'm supposed to be fine with ambiguity and uncertainty. Don't you know? It says so in the cancer handbook that we all get. I'm relying on my oncologist to know what he's doing. So far so good. The latest scan shows improvement. But. What about the next scan? And the next? They don't tell you about the uncertainty and the ambiguity when they diagnose you. 

Until then, I'll pretend like everything's fine when people ask me how I'm doing. I don't want them to carry any burden as they go back to their cancer-free lives. 

Why not me?",2018-05-14 11:40:34

"""Easy"" cancer",76,io5bh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/io5bh1/easy_cancer/,32,1599504600.0,"I've been thinking a lot about having an ""easy cancer"" as a young person. When I say 'cancer' people think about a disease so vile, sneaky, unpredictable and persistent that it can only be killed, if at all, by poisoning yourself to the brink of death and somehow managing to survive. But luckily that is not what cancer is like for many of us. Not meeting this severe image of cancer can cause us to feel like a fraud. We are relieved, but may find our issues dismissed (e.g. from surgery or ""easy"" treatment or living without an organ or facing the idea of death when all our peers are at top health). And those around us are also relieved, but do not have a frame for understanding what we are going through. This can lead to harmful stereotypes. A lot of us may be abandoned by friends who cannot face us even though our situation is not that bad. Or we cannot get a mortgage even though we are much more likely to die of a traffic accident than of our cancer. This all may also impact how we relate to our own disease. We internalize the steteotype and have trouble letting the facts of our disease sink in. We may insist on getting more intense treatment and monitoring than our situation actually warrants. We worry about scans more than is is perhaps necessary. We expect treatment to be more difficult than it is and ""nocebo"" (bad placebo) ourselves into experiencing negative side effects. All in all, this severe image of cancer makes our lives very difficult. And that sucks. Having cancer is bad enough.",2020-09-07 18:50:00

i’m watching my mom die.,71,drdbpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/drdbpm/im_watching_my_mom_die/,8,1572875044.0,"her birthday was two weeks ago. we took her to a nice restaurant and had cake at home. my dad took so many photos and videos. it hurt knowing that he was doing this because she’ll be dead soon.

at least that’s what the oncologist has alluded to. “around for halloween, thanksgiving.” no christmas. no new years. she was originally given 2 months to live when we found out last year. she’s gone through radiation, several chemotherapies, immunotherapy. some helped, but not much. she’s looking into hospice now. she’s in constant pain despite the medicine and medical marijuana.

i suffer from depression. i’ve been off my meds for almost two months. obviously not helpful. i’m angry all the time and when i’m not angry, i’m crying. i’m angry she smoked for decades. i’m angry she still smokes. i’m angry i’ve been her main caretaker for over a year. i quit my job. i failed two semesters of college (one due to a hurricane/breakup/taking care of my mom combo, and the other from just taking care of her). my brothers are kept in the dark about her state because one is doing “so well” at his college that if he finds out, he’ll “fuck it up.” the other keeps fucking up and if he finds out, “he’ll spiral and do something stupid. again.” according to my mom.

so i get saddled with all the information. the caretaking. i’m angry about it. what about my mental health? i’m angry nobody helps. i’m angry my mom won’t let anybody else help. i’m angry that i feel so selfish. she won’t be here to see me or my brothers graduate college, get married, or have kids. she won’t be here for me to ask for advice. i won’t be able to take her on trips like i envisioned, once i had a career and the money for it. i’m saving all her texts, voicemails. i’m scared of her dying. she’s been the only constant in my life and now she’ll be gone.

she isn’t dead, but i feel like she died a while ago. she can’t remember anything. it’s hard to hold a conversation because she can’t connect her brain to her mouth. i translate what she means when we go places and she has to talk to a doctor or anybody else. sometimes she has good days. but lately it’s all been bad. i’ve barely seen her leave her room, much less the bed. i want my mom back. i want to stop being angry and sad.

its hard to find a place to cry. i cry alone in the car or when i’m working at the barn. i’m mad my boyfriend’s cousin has cancer, but all he has to do is take a pill once a day because of some genetic mutation? it’s not fair. i’m fucking distraught. i feel so alone. i need a giant field where i can just scream until my throat bleeds and nobody will hear.

i’ll probably delete this. i’m sorry. its almost midnight and i cant sleep from crying so much. i just needed to put this somewhere where i might be understood",2019-11-04 13:44:04

I’m gonna be completely honest, there are times I miss it. My family was nicer to me, and even complete strangers.  Now that I have hair and I don’t look like I’m about to die of malnourishment, things are different. No more phone calls checking on me, no more strangers calling me a warrior, no one is running a race in my honor, no more pink ribbons. 

This is a different kind hard. I’m wondering how other survivors cope with life after cancer?

A list of questions for an end of life interview.,75,bo9wzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/bo9wzt/a_list_of_questions_for_an_end_of_life_interview/,2,1557813565.0,"My 15 year old daughter planned and ran a video of me reading and answering questions about my life.  There were so many wonderful moments to this so I asked if I could post them here to help others and she's really pleased to help.

&#x200B;

These questions are personal to me, and as you read through them, the immature pop culture obsessed person I am.  I play drums in a band so I love my music.  I love monster movies and science fiction, cooking and eating.  Therefore, use these as a start then modify to make them more personal as not everyone will want to decide whether Godzilla is better or worse than Super 8, Alien, etc!  (I will not say what my pick is!)

&#x200B;

**The way this ran was as follows:**

1. Print the questions onto paper and then slice them up
2. Place them, folded into a hat, bowl or whatever else makes sense on a table next to where you feel comfortable making the video
3. Put the camera on a tripod, we used a phone as the camera is really good but that's up to personal choice.  Just make sure the lighting is OK!
4. Have the family there as you read and answer the questions.  Their responses are as much a part of this as your own
5. Take breaks if you need to as it can always be edited together later
6. Press the record button!
7. Start with asking what you are doing and in this case, my daughter said we are asking questions about my life so they have something permanent to remember me by.
8. Start by taking a question out of the hat, unfolding it, read the question and give your best answer.  Keep going until they are all gone
9. You will need tissues and a glass of water as at times it got very emotional - and that is wonderful.
10. Most importantly, enjoy it.  We did.

Coming up on the average life expectancy post-diagnosis and feeling terrified,73,97bexw,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/97bexw/coming_up_on_the_average_life_expectancy/,27,1534304103.0,"I found out I had an infiltrating brain tumor in my left thalamus in November 2017. When I had a biopsy, we found out it had the H3 K27M mutation. That puts it in the same class as DIPG— they’re all called “diffuse midline glioma” now. 

Average survival time for kids with DIPG is ~9 months. That’s the most common type of cancer in this class. They usually have very large tumors in the pons that respond well to radiation, shrink and lay dormant for a few months, then grow exponentially and uncontrollably. I’m five months post-radiation and two months off of maintenance chemo (clinical trial!)

I am so fucking scared. I know I already have a better shot because mine is theoretically resectable and has no blood vessel growth/mitotic features under a microscope, and it responded to treatment, I just... I’m 18. I haven’t seen ANYTHING or done half the things I want to do. Nobody wants to admit that I could die. I feel really fucking frustrated that very few people understand how serious this is. 

Also, I’m paranoid. Headache? Tumor grew and pressed against my third ventricle, causing hydrocephalus. Backache? Spread to my spinal cord. Nauseated? Also something wrong. 

I don’t feel like it’s fair to hold out hope for beating the odds when they are so firmly stacked against me. Goddamnit, I don’t want to hope and get it crushed and watch my mom suffer through losing a child. She’s my best friend and my biggest cheerleader. I don’t know if I would survive losing her. I don’t want her to have to lose me to cancer when that was a fear she had all throughout my childhood. I’m just so tired of being scared and of imagining the future.",2018-08-15 03:35:03
We lost him,75,8x275w,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/8x275w/we_lost_him/,32,1531092627.0,"On the 6th, my father passed away because of cancer. He showed absolutely no symptoms when he was diagnosed with Stage IV Colon and Liver cancer a few months ago. It was terrible watching him suffer, but I guess it is over now. I am having a really hard time accepting his fate. He was 49 when he died. I am his only son, and I am 20. My sister is a little younger than me. The first two days, I didn't feel upset at all. I felt fine. I was relieved that he wasn't in pain anymore, and felt that the end of his life was for the better since he wouldn't be suffering anymore. I am not sure why, but last night I fell apart. 

I miss him so much already. It really is the little things that get to you. I miss saying hello and goodbye to him. I miss hearing his voice, seeing him in his spot on the couch, just having him around. I thought I was at peace with his passing when I was in the hospital with him. He held off medication when he was admitted a few days before his death just to have one final conversation with me, and that conversation means more to me than I can explain. I am very fortunate to have had that real goodbye to him, and I know that. 

I am having a lot of trouble coping with it. I understand his death, but I don't like the uncertainty of the future. I'm not sure what the next month will be like, and that is really hard for me. I love him and am happy he is no longer suffering. It's what he wanted. No one should go through the pain he was in at the end. I wonder how long it will be before I fully adjust to the new reality. 

I am trying to make things as normal as possible. I can adapt to the changes like him not being around, as long as that is the only element that changed. If I take it as one challenge at a time, it is much easier for me to adjust. One problem is that family keeps visiting. They are not normally around, so adapting to my new home life is harder with all of these outside elements involved. I get that they are there because they care and all that, but it makes the grieving process more complicated when my house is full of people who don't usually go there. 

It's a hard time. However, it is my reality, and i have no choice but to overcome this. ",2018-07-08 23:30:27

Caring for a loved one,74,igtx0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/igtx0y/caring_for_a_loved_one/,14,1598452700.0,"Hello, I'm sorry in advance for my horrible Grammer but I hope you understand my message. 

My name is Jenny and I'm 18, I was a carer for my father though his 9 month cancer struggles. I pushed him into the doctors office and cried with him everyday. I held his hand as feel asleep and kissed his forehead for the last time. 

When you sign up to be a carer for a family member they tell you it won't be easy and they are right. Nothing is going to prepare you for what is about to unfold. 

At first I thought it wasn't to hard and I could handle it. Helping him move from his bed to wheelchair, pushing him around the house and to the doctor's them few times. 
Cutting up his food and using different plates incase he dropped them. It was a breeze, but it got harder. Before I knew it he couldn't walk and than he needed paper and pen to talk, I had to brush his teeth, whip him down for showers. 
But yet it was still nothing, I was become exhausted so fast form stuff so simple and I wish I reached out and I wish I wasn't afraid to say I needed more help. 

Dad being sick didn't just make me the carer for him, I now cooked, cleaned, shopped and did everything around the house for my brother's and I got frustrated with them for not helping but it wasn't right of me, they did what they could just like I should have been doing. 

One day was all it took for dad to stop being able to walk, one day and he could no longer stand, one day and he could no longer talk, one day and he could no longer use the toilet. 

Always be prepared. Always be a step ahead. 

My dad like many was stubborn and I had to push, I pushed him into that first doctors appointment and I pushed him to every meeting and every check up for as long as I could. But there was a time to stop where he begged to just stop.

As much as we want to help them we need to take a step back at times and listen, my dad never went to chemo and I'm glad I didn't push him into something he didn't want.  My dad stopped seeing a doctor and for a while it was okay. 

Know when to push and when to stay back. Don't always be at 100% because sometimes it's just not wroth it. 

My dad died at home, he died happy. 

Make the most of your time with them and always remember you are a daughter, son, child, partner, mother, father, ect before you are a career and they would always want to be your loved one. 


Take it slow, be prepared and always ask for help. There are people out there. 


Thank you for reading and please take care.",2020-08-26 14:38:20

In public, I would make jokes, laugh, anything to not show the vulnerability. If you’re not laughing, you’re crying. That’s what he taught me. He laughed a lot.

He was clever, quick, great at strategy games, and a little – lot – goofy. In our nearly half a decade together, he cried 3 times. That last time, it hurt me, the way he accepted his brain cancer. But he started laughing more after that, and I loved that. He would ask for lots of foods, to make me feel useful, I think.

He would ask how we were doing. He never complained. Never. He had a subtle charisma, charming. I couldn’t have asked for a better partner. Don’t think I’ll ever find one again.

At any rate, we need to take this time to be the best version of ourselves. I’m sorry for what you’re all going through, and I would give anything to stop it or take it myself. We’re in this together. And if we’re not laughing, we’re crying.

I don't really know what it is I'm getting at here. I just want you all to know that no matter how bad it gets, we each have a little personal power to not let it destroy our hearts.

A question for those with incurable disease,74,dd3voc,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/dd3voc/a_question_for_those_with_incurable_disease/,29,1570201565.0,"Sorry to be blunt but how do you feel about the fact you’re going to die? 

So many groups I’m a part of on the internet desperately scramble to avoid the elephant in the room. I suffer from low grade ovarian cancer and am currently stable after surgery and six months of chemotherapy, but will almost definitely never be cancer free. I am likely to die within the next 2 to 8 years.  

When I was in the midst of treatment, I felt so close to death and was scared, but also very weak. My sickness felt like a stroke of fate. I was abandoned by my mother as a young child and consequently had severe anxiety and depression growing up. An illness that rendered me infertile didn’t really come as any surprise. As a teenager I used to pray for death as I didn’t have the resolve to kill myself. I felt like everything made sense in this perverse logic I had constructed to make sense of how messed up everything is.

Now I am healthy again, the knowledge of my impending death feels so complicated. I’m going to return to school next year to finish my degree and hopefully travel. I have no desire to work ever again. To me working was something I had to do in order to save for my future family, something I will never have.

In some ways I try to reason with myself that this is just the narrative of my life, tricking myself that I’m important - to make my early, sad death more meaningful. All these ways I try to conceptualise death to make it less daunting, so I can accept it beyond an unfair sickness taking my life before I even really got to live it.

I feel like there’s rarely space for these stories. Maybe it is rare that someone gets the experience of being healthy with the knowledge of their death. Before I got sick I didn’t realise you could be weeks away from dying for cancer whilst being completely fine in every other way. I would love to hear some of your stories and feelings about knowing your death will come way sooner than you ever expected. 

If you’ve gotten to the bottom of this long post, thanks for reading. It felt good typing this out to people who might understand.",2019-10-04 15:06:05

Fast forward to 2019 and my hair had grown back with the chemo curls and while I wasn't happy it was curly, I'm just glad I could grow my hair again.

 I wasn't especially excited at first but after getting out the chair and seeing my reflection in the mirror I felt a kind of joy I haven't had in a long time. As soon as he held up the mirror to show the back of my head a big smile came across my face.

About a year ago, I was diagnosed with stage 4 Hodgkins Lymphoma, and immediately, being a redditor, I looked for a cancer related subreddit. Somewhere I could ask questions, get support, and just talk to someone. 

Being a gamer (WoW addict unfortunately), and knowing how universal Discord is, I brought up the suggestion, and not soon after, a Discord server was made. Immediately joined, and we started our own server journey.

From that we've built a community of approximately 200 users currently, more or less. Over 1 year and counting. Some more talkative than others, myself being almost always on. Since day 1, I've been able to make some great friendships, got questions answered by people, and able to get through one of, if not the hardest time in my life. Now I want to offer (well, make more visible) our servers to every one reading this subreddit, since the new layouts and mobile apps don't offer the visibility to see the link.


**https://discord.gg/zGA3b4m**

Any and all are welcome in the server. We just ask you mind a few rules (just about same as in the subreddit) and respect others. We have people going through treatment, people in remission, caretakers, and everything in between.

While it may require an account, it's worth the few seconds. We have people almost constantly on, and willing to talk or even just listen. Don't be shy. Just say hey and feel free to jump into whatever we're talking about. We would love to talk with you.

Then, a few years later, my Dad was diagnosed with Esophagus cancer. Our rug had been pulled out of my feet again. I’ve cared for both parents extensively during their illness. I moved into their home with my child to care for them. 

Last Thanksgiving and Christmas, we honestly thought my Dad wouldn’t be around for any other holiday. But yesterday, not only was he here, he was pain free and able to play with the grandkids, joke and kid around, and eat. It reminded me of a time before cancer invaded our little home. And for the briefest of moments, we were all happy. 

Even though my dad has lost over 60lbs, had to rely on tube feeding to survive and has been considered terminal for over a year, here he is. 

I just want to let others know that miracles can happen. Remind your loved ones why you love them. The little things matter just as much as the big moments. 

I hope everyone is able to spend some time with your loved ones during the holidays. Make them a dish they can eat. Give them something to enjoy if they are in the hospital.

June-5 years from now estrogen blocking pill and occasional checkups. Honestly that's the best part a pill a day... Done!!! Go on with life, once every so often see oncologist.... Great make it on a Monday after work the shittiest day of the week...then fuck off doc!! 

Once July rolls around and I am done with radiation... AND I KNOW I HAVE NO MORE VISITS WITH DOCTORS!!!! I am taking a 2 week vacation and I'm doing Jack fucking shit... Seriously I'm sitting on my ass and watching TV, relaxing, being dead to the world... I will do what I want and only what I fucking want.. I'll drink my beer (oncologist said its fine), eating pizza, ribs, wings, anything my heart desires... I will vedge out on the couch. What I say goes... I become god/""leader"" (think of the German word) of my life.... I become authoritarian/fascist to my own life. 

I need a break from 40+ hour weeks of work, and medical shit.... This vacation needs to happen. 

I think I might try to improve my civ 6 skills and play diety... Or I may have a marathon of TV shows (sons of anarchy, breaking bad), read books, or I may just meditate who knows.. The point is what I say goes. 

Sorry for the fuck bombs... But I'm tired of this shit.

Update: today was number 3...25 to go!! I'm keeping track by paychecks.... 3 more paychecks after tomorrow and I'm done.",2020-05-14 20:43:27

Help? Advice? 6 months to 24 months to live... and the people around me just don't get it.,73,fhxtge,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/fhxtge/help_advice_6_months_to_24_months_to_live_and_the/,87,1584125792.0,"I was diagnosed with a late stage IV adenocarcinoma all along my right side abdominal wall and cavity... inoperable AFAIK. The docs say 6 months if I do nothing, 2 years if chemo does well for me. Mayyyyyybe 5 years if I'm super lucky. 

My roommate and my boyfriend just... don't get it. I'm trying to tell them, ""Guys, since chemo makes me feel great half the time, and like total hammered cr\*p the other half of the time... if I live 5 years, I have about 900 ""good days"" that I get to enjoy. If I live 2 years I have about 300+ good days I can enjoy, probably. I DO NOT want to spend those days in a messy, dirty, disorganized house, so HELP ME!""

They don't. Chemo is helping me feel and act as if I am getting back to being ""normal me."" My cancer is an intestinal one that is relatively asymptomatic to someone just looking at me. They're all sunshine, rainbows, and ""you're gonna beat this!!"" positive attitude. Which I would appreciate more if it didn't seem like an excuse to be in total denial and change nothing about how they act day to day.

I'm \*this close\* to just flipping out and telling them both to move out. It's dark sounding, I know but... I'd rather be alone and face the end alone, than live in the kind of mess two ""adult"" man-babies can make of a house, y'know?

Just needed to vent about denial masquerading as positive vibes, in a forum where people will probably ""get it."" And IDK... can anyone give advice about how to make the most of the time you have, on a strict poverty budget? Anyone who's kinda been there who can relate?

I have, like 5 close people in my life, total. And 4 of them just... they just are not equipped to handle this. My BFF of 20 years is amazing, but I can't dump all this on one friend, y'know? The local support group seems to meet just once a month. 

I kinda think... therapy, maybe? I don't even know how that would help, though. I feel like I'm dealing with things calmly and practically, and the people around me are just pretending everything's gonna be ok. Why do \*they\* need to believe that, but I can be okay with trying to make the most of the time I have? Why do they \*get\* to believe that, when I can't afford to act that way? I'm not angry about the darn cancer at this point, it's just a mindless force of nature. An accident of genetics. I'm angry at the people who I need to depend on, but I in many ways can't. 

I'm OK, I really have made my peace. I've always tried to live my life with no reasons for regret or missed adventures. I could go today and I'd be sad, but not scared or angry. I'm taking the diagnosis better than everyone around me, TBH, both emotionally and in the sense of being hopeful but not denying the medical facts either.

Anyone have any advice, ideas, comfort, or want to vent together?",2020-03-13 18:56:32
A memorial to a fellow Redditor and how much this subreddit means to all of us,70,epa9bs,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/epa9bs/a_memorial_to_a_fellow_redditor_and_how_much_this/,13,1579158807.0,"When I first joined this subreddit I didn’t know what to expect. I wanted a place to go to speak to other people who are going through cancer treatment and the stand alone forums and all the websites like American cancer society just had too scary of statistics to manage 

The internet is a very scary place, you never know who you will encounter and how they will react to you asking for emotional support. People on the internet aren’t as nice as your friends and families who know you. But sometimes you get lucky. 

My first post here was to ask anyone else if they had the same cancer as me. I have a very rare cancer and a very subset of that cancer. This women who was 12 years older than me responded and told me to message her anytime. 

From May to August through the up and downs of treatments, deciding which chemo to pick, waiting for scan results, etc she helped me. We were complete opposites she was married with kids living in the a small city in the south and I am younger single living in New York. She Always spoke about how we effect others when we go through treatment and how our job is not only to change our outlook on life but also theirs. She’s been fighting for 3 years and she taught me to normalize it. She went to part time work when she can if even she was tired and tried to travel. She cared for her son deeply. Even after chemos and radiation’s she would be so tired she made it a daily effort to go outside and play with her son. 

In July I received terrible news that my disease has spread to my lung. At this point I been sick since 21 and I have been in treatment so long I couldn’t battle anymore. I couldn’t find a way to live. If living required another a year of treatment I couldn’t physically do it. I was highly suicidal, not listening to my family or friends and completely babbling psychosis. She was the only person that was able to stop me and talk me from a ledge. She reached out to me after reading one of my posts and was extremely worried about my state of mind. She told me how important I am to my family and to her and how we must continue forward because it is the only way to go, there is no suicidal option. 

This Redditor recently passed away. I’m not sure from what or when but I saw she was posting less I was concerned and checked her last posts and messaged her and she had told me she was in the hospital for the last 8 weeks for an infection. 

Out of respect to her and her family I am not putting her name here but she was a special Person of this subreddit. She answered a lot of questions and offered a lot of advice. She was always willing to lend a helping hand, especially when it came to patients who are fighting while raising young kids. 

This is my memorial to her, I thank her for every wisdom she’s given me and I thank this forum for allowing me to meet her. 

Even if you just answer a comment, or answer a dm from a newly diagnosed person who is scared and doesn’t know where to go, you are helping someone. You mean more than you think. 

We are all fighting this disease together, in our own way but there are rarities in the connections that we make where we can make it a little easier to mood forward. 

May this Redditor rest easy and may you all be healthy in the new year

This year my 10 year niece was diagnosed with cancer. Its been tough but we feel so incredibly blessed to be around people who care so much. 

We also spent Christmas in the hospital and she was quite upset intially. However the entire week was filled with nurses, doctors, volunteers from various organisations and even fellow patients and thier families all organising activities and handing out presents. 
 People are so incredibly generous not only with money but just with the time and effort they spend in making other people happy.

On Christmas Eve we also handed out presents to all the nurses and the patients and just seeing the smile on their faces was worth it. There were children from 17 weeks old to 13+ years and they were all fighting this tough battle against cancer.

We often live life unaware of the struggle others face and this year has just made us realise how important it is to help others in whatever way we possibly can. We should always count the blessings we have, and take inspiration from others to keep our hope alive and strong.

Cancer is tough on everyone involved and just want to say that Stay Strong Everyone.

To the patients - You all are incredibly brave and wish everyone that is fighting this battle lots of strength and hope and a speedy recovery. 
For the caregivers who are so incredibly selfless you guys are awesome! Often we underappreciate the ones who put in the most effort so thank you for everything you do.
For those that have passed away, our thoughts will always be with you and for those who are missing them during this time, warm hugs to you. 

And finally to all the nurses, doctors, cleaners, administrators and all the other hospital staff, you guys are so hardworking and take such good care of each and every person. Thank you for all that you do!

Lots of love from us to you!",2019-12-25 10:37:23

My name is Ali, and I'm 20 years old. I'm also just like many - if not all - of you, I have cancer, and to be exact: chondroblastic osteosarcoma.

I did the surgery two years ago in October 2018, followed by 12 sessions of chemotherapy in about 4-5 months. I was clear ever since then, with no signs of metastasis shown in the extracted part of the left-tibia after the surgery. That is, well... until now.

Today, Oct. 12, 2020, I attended the follow-up appointments with the orthopedist and the oncologist, where I also had taken Computed Tomography scan of my left-leg and my thorax firstly. During the first one, I talked to the orthopedist's assistant about my medical situation (how I feel, pains, how much I can walk without a crutch). She went to discuss the images with the specialist and both entered the room. He checked how well my left lower leg is recovering, and seemed satisfied with how well it does.

He assured the CT images of the tibia looks perfectly fine. As for the lungs however, he told me that I have three spots which seemed to produce calcium and bone matrix, indicating that I have some mets from the sarcoma. The largest one has a diameter of 15 mm, while the others 13 and 7 mm.

I was very speechless about the situation, as I was really excited for hearing good news, considering I have had my titanium plate broken and my stubborn wound that didn't want to close properly until a gastrocnemius flap surgery. Devastated, however, isn't strong enough to describe my feeling.

The orthopedist has reassured me that his patients who undergo such situations more than two years after the surgery, don't have any metastasis anymore when they underwent the lung surger(ies) and/or the adjacent chemotherapy.

The oncologist has shown me the lung images and shown me where they're exactly located: two on the right lung and one in the left. He has told me a chemo won't help, so he explained the two types of lung surgery. The first one is to open the cage and touch the area and sense where the lesion is located. He told me that you would have to stay longer in the hospital and that it's very big surgery. The other one is to use small cameras inserted from the sides of the body and more specifically find the lesions and extract them. It seemed people with such situations undergo this one, not only should I stay in the hospital for like three days, it's a relatively smaller surgery, and the oncologist seems more confident that I would choose for this one. He attempted to make an urgent appointment with the thoracic - which he seemed to trust him very much - so that I discuss with him the best procedure and plan a surgery ASAP.

The moment I came back home, I shed so many tears and I can't stop. I'm not afraid of the surgery, or if necessary, the chemo as well, heck I even told the doctors loudly that I want to get rid of them. I fear what's unknown, I question myself what will happen after that with me, my family, my friends, and anyone who I know and who knows me. I've always believed that once it's gone, it's going to be normal again, but little did I know. I'm starting to think this is like movies which have many sequels, such as Batman or I don't know. Is it, just... wrong to have a definitive happy ending, where it's gone once and for all?

Wednesday, I'll have to undergo a nuclear magnetic resonance imaging where they're going to check the bones for something suspicious, which I definitely hope not there is.

And here I am, sitting in my room, having no clue what's next, who am I going to tell, or what am I going to do with my life. I've been optimistic and to this very moment, I still am. But my clueless, coward self is very triggered because of this slap to the face. What must I do?",2020-10-13 01:16:15

Chemo worked. She was operated. They gave radiation to decrease the chance of recurrence, but before the treatment was over the cancer had spread to her lungs. We found this out in October 2019. They gave another trearment. In February this year we found out it spread to her liver. She got an experimental treatment that didn't work for her during which the cancer spread to her eyes and brain. Her liver had worsened as well. She got the same chemotreatment as the one she was on first. It seemed to help a little but they stopped it for some time so they could give radiation treatment for her brain. Today the chemo was supposed to start again. My mom has been having a lot of pain from her liver this weekend and she has been feeling very tired. So she expected her bloodcount would be too low for chemo and she expected to get a blood transfusion. To our surprise, we get the news that they're stopping treatment and they're starting up morfine to reduce the pain (palliative care).

This feels like such a whirlwind. Up until when she was getting the radiation for her brain (which ended a week ago) the doctors kept telling us not to give up hope and not to panick. I knew she couldn't be cured, but with the message they were giving I assumed she still had months (at least), especially since the chemo seemed to be working somewhat. I don't really know what to expect. The doctor said she would slip into a coma at some point, but he said he couldn't really indicate how long she still has. I know they're giving her medication to keep the pain under control, but I just keep asking myself whether the body might not give some kind of stress reaction in the end making her feel anxious or something. I just hope she is comfortable...

I'm still sitting with her in the hospital atm while she's sleeping. She hasn't said a lot since she got the news. My dad was very worried this morning, but due to corona only one person could come with her. I don't live with my parents anymore, so I was unaware of how much it had worsened in a few days. If I knew what was up and how worried my dad was, I would have given my spot to him. We haven't informed him yet since I don't want to tell him over the phone.

Regression we beat it - then 40 days later, over a July 4th weekend barbecue, she said she felt some discomfort in the same area as before. The cancer was back and growing at twice the rate. Highly aggressive. Like it knew we tried to kill it and wanted revenge. 

We tried three rounds of immunotherapy. No response. Fuck it, we knew that was a longshot anyway. She didn’t have the right genetic marker that showed the best clinical success with that particular drug. In a few weeks time the mass on the back of her tongue grew so large it was robbing her of the ability to swallow or even talk. 
She had to have a gastric feeding tube put in. 
The dietician set her caloric requirements target to 2,500 cal/day + 100 grams of protein. 
This is what an athlete fueling up for a game day probably consumes - but this was a daily target. 

What solid food she could ingest had to be blended down into a purée. Have you ever seen someone attempt to enjoy puréed steak or chicken?  Astronaut food paste. It sucks.  

In late November we moved on to a new dual compound drug. Five rounds of a more aggressive chemotherapy. The compound began to work effectively and quite noticeably by the third session. The tumor shrank. Her CT scans came back with increasingly positive news. 

Her liveliness and desire to go out and do activities, although limited, returned. We went to the movies - Knives Out. Her appetite returned. Things were on the upswing. 

I was getting my mother back and not this hollow shell of an entity that used to represent my mother  occupying the spare bedroom in my house ... the one that now doubled as a medical center.


It’s like the cancer knew we were winning again and so it decided to employ a new trick to fuck us over - it waited for a blood infection to strike. She felt a little wheezy on Friday. They gave her a strong dose of antibiotic drip during the chemo session. 

Saturday she felt a little better. Sunday, not so well. Sunday night diarrhea. Monday, wouldn’t leave the room but largely responsive. By Tuesday she was deep in the throws of septic shock. Unable to fight off the illness, she died early this morning. 

I was with her in her waning hours. She looked at me and called me “Mom” although I’m her son. Her speech was garbled and unintelligible. I gave her a pad and pen so she could hopefully communicate with me - all she wrote was “Home”. Over and over and over. Each letter deteriorating in repetition.

My dad was my best friend and my other half pretty much. And my best friend went to the hospital in February for a stomach ache- he had been acting funny for the past few months but kept saying “just stressed out with work”. And a week later, he was diagnosed with stage four liver cancer, and died a week after that.

I didn’t know a lot about cancer before this. I always thought you had a fighting chance, treatments, surgeries, hope. I didn’t know what stage four meant. I didn’t know what metastatic meant. When I got the diagnosis, I thought I would be running charity races to raise money for him.

I didn’t think it could be, “we found cancer, and he is not a candidate for chemo or surgery. Plan your finances. You might have a couple of months with him.” 

I didn’t think it would be as quick as two weeks. 

I didn’t think I wouldn’t get a father daughter dance, he wouldn’t see me run the Boston marathon someday, or help me raise an Australian Shepherd. I know those things seem so silly and of course there are way bigger issues in the world, but those were my dreams and I never pictured my dreams maybe coming true without him being a part of them. I’m gonna be 28 and I’m crying like a child about not being able to call my dad during work breaks. I feel like the biggest loser for how sad I’ve been in the past three months. I’m scared I’m never going to be normal again, and that’s because my dad was the person that always made everything better.

I feel guilty for not knowing how to help him. I’m not a doctor, I’m just a photographer. But I researched everything and was with him for 14 days straight in the hospital. I sometimes wonder if I just missed something. We had great doctors, and I know it was terminal. I guess I still haven’t come to terms with what terminal illness is, and I am just sad about this too because I’m normally a rational person. 

I am just so heartbroken and lost. And I’m sorry for everyone that’s going through this too. I hope you guys find peace.

If I Didn't Know I Had Cancer . . .,72,anytkh,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/anytkh/if_i_didnt_know_i_had_cancer/,24,1549535166.0,"..I wouldn't know I had cancer. Diagnosed a few months ago with a breast cancer that I know had been growing for a while (complicated reasons for neglecting it). PET scan found involvement in bones - an automatic Stage IV. Bone scan found some of that was not cancer, but due to arthritis.

Surprised to learn I would not have chemo or surgery. The slow-growing, estrogen-sensitive tumor would be treated with hormone blockers and a fairly new medication (Imbrance). Side effects have been minimal. I have not had to give up any activities.

I'm a Christian and believe that I have received the ""peace that passes understanding."" I could tell you more about that aspect if anyone is interested.

 It helps that I am older (76), so that may be why the treatment is less aggressive , but it appears to be working as the tumor has shrunk a bit. My oncologist says I should think of it as a chronic illness for which I will need continued treatment. At my age, I take it one day at a time. I have already had a long life so think of any future as a bonus.

I feel a bit guilty when I think about how easy I am getting off and what some of the people I know with cancer have had to go through. It breaks my heart to see young folks diagnosed. My prayers are with you all.",2019-02-07 10:26:06

$10,000.00 a month.  That's the cost for me to stay alive.  I think I recall them saying that when my hemoglobin dropped below 7, I could go into organ failure.  I'm at 9.5.  And the only option open to me is a pill a day... for the rest of my life... (or until they find a cure)... one little pill a day. 

&#x200B;

For $10,000.00 a month.

&#x200B;

I've been at this for 6+ years, and I'm getting tired.  Now all that's left is a little pill... one little pill a day.  For $10,000.00 a month... $340 per pill.  I saw someone was selling gold pills for $999 each that would turn your shit gold.  To save my life, though, just $340 per pill.

I'm still in shock.

They're just looking into my records to make sure I'm not at my lifetime limit for doxorubicin( aka adriamycin, aka red devil), and also making sure my kidneys can take new rounds of ifosfamide.

New to the experience,71,hxuwui,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/hxuwui/new_to_the_experience/,24,1595742469.0,"Not sure where else to turn at this point. I feel like the last week has been an absolute blur. My 10 year old daughter has something, not sure what at this point, in her brain. Tumor, mass, whatever they're calling it until we can get some kind of biopsy done. 

It began July 21 with a doctor's visit because of persistent migraine type headaches. No vomiting or any other symptoms, just a headache that has persisted for the past week almost. Doctor noticed that her pupils were of different sizes and sent her for a full blood panel, x-ray, and then to an optometrist. Nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary on anything, even the optometrist didn't see any weird pressure in her eye although her left eye was 1.5-2 whatevers off from her right eye. 

I am very thankful for her pediatrician. She persisted and got us an MRI scheduled July 22. She called us at 2:30 the same day, it's a mass and we're to be admitted into the hospital the next morning. The tumor didn't want to wait and her headaches started to cause pain spikes later that night and we ended up in the ER. The powerlessness you feel as a father with your daughter crying out in pain nearly has you physically hurting with her. They got a pain cocktail in her and she finally was able to sleep.

This thing is sitting in her 3rd ventricle of the brain blocking flow of spinal fluid, causing pressure build up. We feel blessed at the moment since it's not spread down her spine and all panels are coming back clear, so it's not spreading. There is a calcification around the tumor, so a biopsy could release things into the system and allow a spread, but we don't have any options. We don't know what we're fighting.

We've been in the hospital since. Her right eye is starting to get blurry, like the left, and she's developed some tinnitus. She is being so strong. She's seen the pictures, knows what's going to happen, and the only concern she shows is ""Are they going to stick me with a needle again?"" 

I know there isn't much here, just our story thus far. It feels good to get it out there into the void. Covid has changed how hospitals operate, so it just the parents in the room. Everyone else has to be outside and we meet them in the parking lot. Skype has become a friend just to see people. 

We've setup a [CaringBridge](https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/kaleyhall) site. It's not much, but it's nice to know people are walking with us. The worst part of this is feeling like you're walking alone. We ask nothing of anyone, but to just read the story. If it end here or we continue on, thank you for walking this with us.

Edit: She had her first surgery for an endoscopic third ventriculostomy and biopsy. We now know we're dealing with small round blue cell tumor and my daughter is finally without headaches. We'll know in the next couple of days the pathology. Thank you all for your stories and well wishes.

He fell down around Labor Day, and showed a lot of cognitive signs relatively suddenly, so we went in and he basically had an MRI immediately and surgery right away that night. Although the diagnosis was devastating (given how young he is and previous experience losing a family friend in 8mos to glio) his surgeon did an amazing job with the resection and managed to remove basically the entire tumor. We were told he could have anywhere from 18-24mos initially, with a possible chance of more time if testament went well. 

Dad started Temodar orally about a month after surgery/rehab, and then radiation five days a week for six weeks. The radiation was really well targeted using a mask, and he didn’t really have any side effects aside from constipation and the standard hair loss in that area. He was a bit tired and a little fuzzy on details, but that was all relatively fine. I moved him in with me, became his primary caretaker, and was prepared to go in for a second session of higher rad this month. We were pretty much dreading it, in fact, but figured what the hell, we gotta do it to give him a chance. He had a prep MRI and we readied for another session. 

But! Today we saw no new growth!!! He’s doing AMAZING and his surgeon really did a fantastic job. Now, instead of having to go IV or higher rad, he will be on oral Temodar again for five days a month for six months, which will likely have a little nausea, but is significantly easier since he can take it at home, and we’re going to try a relatively new FDA-approved device that could bump his chances to make it past 5yrs from 5% to 30%. 

Obviously we can’t always predict how treatment goes and I know that, but the knowledge that I may have more time with him? Just a bit more? That’s huge. Any extra time is a huge thing for me. I’ve been living in a fog for the last months, totally sure my dad would die in a year or less, and now it feels like a fog has lifted. I could have more years with him! Making bad jokes and driving me crazy! More years of my dad is something I didn’t want to hope I could have.

I then switched to another treatment I forget the name which did work for a while but then all of a sudden it gave me severe inflammation to the point I ended up in the hospital for a week with pretty significant pain .

And do you know what my doctors tell me to take for pain? TYLENOL! Not Tylenol with Codeine. Just plain ol' over the counter Tylenol! That's right! After my surgery I was given 5mg of oxysomething once in the hospital and then Tylenol from there on out and if I were to call my doctor right now and tell them X hurts, they would tell me to take...you guessed it, Tylenol! And it works pretty well in me too.

And, if I did have cancer related pain bad enough to necessitate narcotics/opioids then you can sure as hell bet I wouldn't be sharing it because if I had it it would only be because I needed it, for, you know, cancer pain.

He was really secretive with the whole thing (specific type, stage, if he was getting treatment etc) and it was really hard to get answers from him. Every time I asked how he was doing he would nod and say, ""I'm okay, you know, just trying to get better"" and I'll always remember his voice when he gave that answer, it sounded very defeated yet you can tell he wanted to be strong for my family and I. He lived with my parents the last couple of months because he started to feel a little weaker as time went on. I still hoped that he would get better and had dreams where he looked ""non sick"" and I would tell him how much better he looked. By Thanksgiving he started to get more reclusive and looked incredibly weak and pale. Still I thought ""He'll get through this, it has to get worse before it could get better"".

A week in a half before he passed, he had fallen and bruised his eye pretty bad, and I went to see him and he looked worse and worse, started talking less, and could barely hear him, would stand with his walker in the house when he got tired just to catch his breathe. The last Sunday I saw him I had taken the whole family out to lunch because I wanted to spend some family time with all of us. He barely ate, and would put his head down because he was so weak and looked incredibly pale and his mouth..he kept his bottom shriveled and it would tremble from time to time. Yet when he saw his niece (my baby daughter) he would light up and it made me smile. He always asked about her and told my wife and I to come visit so he could see her. When we left the restaurant I gave him a hug and said ""Alright, bro love you man, see you later"". Those were the last words that I spoke to him and I will never ever forget those words.

&#x200B;

He wasn't perfect, but he was my older brother and the oldest of us siblings. We laughed together, cried together, and got into fights, all the things that brothers do. I'm gonna miss him so much and while I do have regrets, I know that I tried my best to be with him in his final couple of months made sure to tell him how much I loved him.

She was diagnosed with a rare uterine cancer (MMMT/ Carcinosarcoma) in July. The doctor said it was “very treatable” the plan was 3 rounds of chemo and then surgery. The third chemo was the turning point. They had to switch chemos because she developed an allergic reaction to the first one. The second one only made her sick and did nothing to the tumor. 

Now it has spread to her intestines and she can’t eat or drink anything because of the tumors blocking several points in her digestive tract. Yet she is throwing up several times a day. How is that even possible?! 

Now they are saying that the only thing that can heal her is if this new chemo she got 3 days ago works. They can’t operate on her and didn’t offer radiation. This is our Hail Mary. I’m trying to be as hopeful as I can but seeing her frail body (she lost so much weight) with bones showing all over, Its getting harder and harder not to come unhinged.

Part of this is that I come from a family and community of very faith focused people, while my wife and I fall into more of an agnostic belief system. Everyone I've told wants to make it a conversation about capital G god, and that is not cathartic for me in any way. 

Last week my son had a high fever and some lethargy, but was otherwise his normal 19 month old tornado of a person. Thursday I took him to a pediatrician for an abdominal inspection due to bloating, and was told he was gassy. Saturday while I was at a fantasy football draft my wife noticed a lump in his abdomen. She took him to urgent care, who referred us to the ER. Five hours later we are told we need to drive 8 hours to the children's hospital. 24 hours later we are being told that our baby boy has Hepatoblastoma. Currently his liver is massive, and the cancerous mass will not be able to be resected until he has completed several rounds of chemo. We are awaiting full biopsy results to determine a more specific diagnosis. We are being told nothing specific regarding stage or prognosis other than, ""most likely very treatable,"" which makes me angry. We have no hard data, which makes me angry. He has been an amazing, sweet, talkative, loving baby his whole life, and that being stolen from him makes me angry. 

More than anything I'm angry that there's nothing to blame. I am so scared, sad, and furious, and there's not a fucking thing we can do other than love him and try to be strong. I don't know what to do.

I have gained immense respect for all of the other people out there who have experienced this bullshit disease first hand or as parents. Fuck this stupid sickness. 

Vent over. If you made it this far thank you for allowing me some catharsis. I wish you luck in your personal battles, wherever you stand today.

2nd time on 2010.  Now it is in some lymph nodes around the kidneys.  3 rounds BEP(?) and we are done.  

3rd times is a charm.......Flash forward to 2 months ago.  Head and neck pain take me to Kaiser ED.  Head and neck CT leads to Head and Neck MRI which gives us a diagnosis of lesion on right shoulder affecting hypoglossal nerve.  

Given history of cancer, my Dr orders a PET scan.  I light up like a Christmas tree.  Bone lesions on right clavicle, left humerus, T-12 vertebra, the top bone of my neck, and the retro peritoneal lymph nodes that surround my aorta and vena cava.

Now we are off to the races.  Is this a recurrence of my original cancer or is this a new one?  If it is a recurrence then it is easier to treat and more responsive to chemo.  If it is an all new type, then we have a new set of rules.

She had been fighting cancer and the repercussions of it for the past 10 years. First she was diagnosed with breast cancer, had a double mastectomy, diagnosed with diabetes, then was recently diagnosed with metastatic bone cancer that was ‘innumerable’ and found everywhere in her body.

She was the kindest, sweetest, most compassionate woman I’d ever known. She was simple in tastes and joys and needed only a day at the beach or a walk in the park to be happy. Fresh fruit and warm soups were always her favorites.

Cancer took all of that away from her. She suffered, mightily I’ll add, for the last 10 years. In some ways I’m happy she no longer needs to exist in this plane of existence. In others. I’m devastated beyond all degrees of sadness.

The summary is Choroid Plexus Carcinoma (brain tumor) at 11 months, 7 rounds of chemo. Stopped in late February.

The doctors knew he had leptomeningeal disease but said it has been stable. Said it had actually progressed but his carefree oncologist said “he can take the summer off, or we can try this?” Her reasoning behind trying something did little to instill confidence in us. Just seemed like she was in over her head. We would bring up other Dr and she seemed to scoff (yeah I’ve heard of them, why). His April scans were exactly the same as before.

I feel as though I’ve failed him. I’ve failed my son. I shouldn’t have stopped for those 2 months.

He started randomly vomiting a few times a day. His oncologist said something along the lines ‘if it worries you enough take him to the ER.’

We did. They maybe thought he had some hemorrhaging, according to a CT. 

It wasn’t hemorrhaging. It’s his leptomeningeal advancing over the top of his brain and down the sides, very, very quickly. As it does. In less than 8 weeks.

So.. it seems our options are really what they were before.. give him a break,.. or maybe ruin what time he has left with attempts to give him more time (which may end up being horrible from more treatment).

I don’t understand. We knew we felt like we weren’t getting everything from our doctors.. and now.. I just don’t understand.

I know a lot of cancer “survivors”—it’s a cringe term *to me*—have stated that they hate being told they’re brave. Or that they’re so strong. Or that they’re a fighter. I know this isn’t a unique thought of my own. I just hate when friends leave comments on social media saying those things, or when my sister posts a photo of us, and I happen to be bald, the whole comment section turns into tagging me and saying how beautiful I am and I have such a nice shaped head for chemo. Thanks? 

I couldn’t figure out why it pissed me off so much to see those comments. And then I realized today when I posted a collage showing hair growth what upset me. I thought how fast my hair suddenly started growing was interesting, and there are a lot of people I know who haven’t seen me in a while, so I thought I’d update. I regret it now. My whole comment section is full of the same thing: you’re so brave, you’re so positive!, way to look at things positively in such a scary fight!, etc etc. Just a million ways of saying the same thing, and all of it saying nothing. 

I just went to show my sister the ONE funny comment a high school friend left on the post, and I told her the rest of the comments pissed me off. 

I don’t feel brave now and I didn’t during chemo. I didn’t feel like I was battling anything. I didn’t feel like I had the heart of a lion, full of courage. I didn’t feel strong. I was at the weakest I have ever been during chemo. And I’m still pretty weak. I have to ask people to help me open jars now and lift boxes at work. I’m the youngest in my department and now I have to ask everyone else to grab heavy equipment for me. 

I **was** a strong and independent woman before chemo. I still feel that deep down, in character I guess, but physically, I am weak and dependent. In all honesty, going through chemo wasn’t brave. __*I felt like a rat. A lab rat that was trapped, and the only way out was to let the doctors experiment on me.*__ That’s not noble or courageous. That’s just allowing things to happen to you. What was my other choice? Literally: just hope that the cancer wouldn’t come back. And surprise! I’m still there now, 3 months out of chemo. Hoping and praying that the cancer doesn’t show up in my lungs or brain. 

What bravery is there when I cry into my pillow, asking God to just take away the pain, the anxiety, to lift the chemo fog?

My mom was diagnosed in 2016, but this last month she went from being able to begin chemo, to losing her life. I am still so shaken. She didn’t have any paperwork completed so I am just having to figure out how to wing it. It’s crazy. I am taking one more week off and going to California with my boyfriend, which I’m thankful he understands the actual severity, obviously she died, and has been nothing but helpful. 

With no paperwork, I am lost as to what to do. I am also feeling stressed with the costs for her celebration of life. A few family members have said they’d help, but when I try to bring it up I feel like Im being too much. 

I really miss her",2019-02-26 01:11:21

All I have to say is that I am glad the other 32 treatments will be shorter. Before the treatment actually started they had to put me in my mask and run a test run through the treatment and get final clearance from the doctor. This made my time twice as long. One of the problems I have is that with my tonsils being swelled up I have a hard time breathing through my nose. When I am lying on my back I find that I can breath In through my nose but not out. This made my mouth dry and uncomfortable. Other than that it pretty much sucked. I will take the suckiness over cancer any day though. Here is to one treatment closer to cancer free!

Please please please get a second opinion because it could save your life.,70,9uovtx,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/9uovtx/please_please_please_get_a_second_opinion_because/,29,1541544286.0,"This might get a little long but I gotta get this off my chest. We just lost my mother in law who was practically my mother. I married into a middle Eastern family and being a guy from a small town in rural Eastern Texas was definitely an eye opening experience coming into a family like this. We've let my MIL live with us for the last 15 years.

6 years ago she started having problems going to the bathroom and started cramping. She went to the doctor and asked repeatedly for a CT or a colonoscopy but was rejected each time for a year because the doctor said it was just internal hemorrhoids. A year goes by and she's still having issues. Finally gets the CT and they find a mass the size of a grapefruit in her intestines and multiple tumors in her uterus. The doctor immediately signs her up for radiation and to start chemo.

A few months go by and they think there's a chance they can do surgery to remove it. The doctor goes in to remove it and opens her up and is horrified to find that because of the radiation, the tumor has fused itself to a bunch of arteries in her colon and also burned fistulas in her colon which in turn started to leak fecal matter into her body. More on that later. After the surgery we are told that her insurance will no longer support her because she and my FiL make too much money. She makes 600 a month from SSI and he makes 900 and it's their only source of income. They have to lie and tell the insurance company and the hospital that they are separated after 49 years of marriage so that way she can get state provided health care coverage. The hospital then puts in a few stents, a colostomy bag.

A year goes by and we find out about MD Anderson so we find out they'll cover her and start treatment. They were fantastic and started treating her right away. We tried multiple chemos and experimental treatments where she was like patient number 2 in the world to get these immunotherapy drugs. Everything failed. During all this time she's on antibiotics the entire time due to the fistulas leaking fecal matter into her body which they can't operate on because her intestines are like tissue paper. She's in and out of the hospital for a few years dealing with these infections.

So queue up October 15th. She is admitted to the hospital at 2am in the morning for abdominal cramping and she's unable to keep anything down. They CT her and find that she has an infection in her abdomen the size of a football that has compartmentalized itself so she didn't have chilling or fevers. It pushed her intestines and colon to the upper right side of her abdomen. They tried for 4 days to get the infection under control by using 5 different of the most powerful antibiotics they could use on her. On Thursday the 18th we got to the hospital and we're met with two docs in the room. The one standing in back said Palliative care on her jacket. I knew before she said a word how this was gonna go. She told us there's nothing more we can do and that we have to look into end of life care. We chose hospice and my MiL was coherent and made the decision to go to hospice. We were expecting her to live for 3 maybe 4 days and so were the doctors.

The first 3 days in hospice she was on heavy heavy morphine but she was still coherent and we said our goodbyes and cried and cried. It was very hard because she begged for food and water for 3 days but we couldn't give it to her because he stomach and intestines were already destroyed by the infection After 3 days she closed her eyes and didn't open them again. Because of her infection she had to be left cut open with just gauze over the open section. Day 6 the smells started setting in and filling the entire facility. It was the most traumatic thing I've ever experienced and she lasted a full 20 days with no food and water. I wouldn't wish this on anyone so please please if you suspect something get it checked out and then when you have a diagnosis get it checked again.",2018-11-06 22:44:46

I lost my brother in law last year to cancer. While he was going through chemo, I started recording the Harry Potter books for him so he'd have a friendly voice to listen to during his chemo sessions. I'm still working on them, and it will probably be a while before I have all 7 done...but if anybody would like access to them for yourself or a loved one going through chemo, I'd be happy to share the link. I have books 1 and 2 done now and have promised my sister book 3 by Christmas. 

The quality is not professional, but it's pretty good. I do all the voices, and I have a really good time doing it. They are 100% free and I do them for the joy of doing them, but I figure I should share the joy with others. Hopefully they'll make someone's journey easier. 

If you'd like me to share them with you, please send me a PM with your email address, and I'll share the dropbox link with you.

God bless you all and never lose hope in your battle. Try to find joy every day. ",2018-10-23 23:50:08

It was stage 1, but it was T4 meaning it had breached the outside of my appendix. The doctors were worried that because of that, and the detection of lymphovascular invasion, the tumor might have spread outside of my GI tract. I had a head-to-tie CT scan done last week and today I met with my oncologist and he told me that outside of my GI tract, I was all clear!

Things I Wish Someone Had Told Me When I Was Diagnosed With Cancer…,69,2ivo7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/2ivo7h/things_i_wish_someone_had_told_me_when_i_was/,8,1412995462.0,"I apologize if this is a repost. I didn't write this and I'm not sure who did, it popped up on my Facebook feed. I wish I was told this when I was diagnosed:

Your relationships are about to change. All of them. Some will get stronger. They will probably not be with the people you would expect. The people you want to handle this well might not be able to for a variety of reasons. Some of the reasons will be selfish. Some of them will be entirely innocent and circumstantial. All of them will be forgivable because no one plans for cancer. Carrying bitterness or anger won't help your recovery. Fighting for anyone to stick with you won't cure you. Those who can, will.

You will be determined to have more energy than you do. You will convince yourself that you are thinking straight, are able to handle all of this and do not need anyone. You will run out of fuel. Your body will change first and your mind will follow. You won't lose your mind, memories or sensibility. It will all come back. But, you will be different. You will never have the same sense of self. You should embrace this. Your old self was probably really great. Your transformed self will be even better. Give in to what is happening and trust it.

You are going to feel fear. Even if you are normally stubborn, confident and seemingly invincible you will finally find yourself admitting that you are scared of something. Cancer is scary and incredibly confusing. The unknowing will eat at you worse than the disease itself. You'll need distractions. Music and sleep will probably be the ones you resort to most. Reading will become difficult. So will watching TV or movies, having conversations, writing and basically everything else. They call it ""chemo brain"" for a reason. You will feel normal eventually. Just a new kind of normal. When you feel afraid let yourself lean on those around you. Cry. Be vulnerable. You are vulnerable. There will be time for strength, but never admitting weakness will cause anxiety to mount and your condition to worsen. Let it all out. Yell if you need to. Sing when you feel up to it. Sob uncontrollably. Apologize for your mood swings. Treatments and prescriptions will often be the cause of them. The people that love you will understand.

The people that love you will be just as scared as you are. Probably more. They will be worrying even when they are smiling. They will assume you are in more pain than you are. They will be thinking about you dying and preparing for life without you. They will go through a process that you will never understand just like they will never understand the process you are going through. Let them process. Forgive them when they don't understand. Exercise patience when you can. Know that those that were built for this will be there when you get to the other side and you will all be able to laugh together again. You'll cry together too. Then you'll get to a place where you will just live in the world again together and that is when you know that you have beaten this.

The sooner you recognize that you are mortal, the sooner you can create the mentality for survival. There is a chance you might not make it. Just like there is a chance that you will. Don't look at statistics. You are unique and what is happening inside you is unique. Your fight is yours alone and there are too many factors to compare yourself to others that have had your condition. No one will want you to think about death, but you won't have a choice. You will think about it from the moment you are given your diagnosis. Come to terms with it. Calmly accept it. Then, shift every thought you have into believing that you won't die. You are going to beat this. Your mental focus on that fact will be more powerful than any treatment you receive.

Your doctors and nurses will become your source of comfort. You will feel safe with them. If you do not feel safe with them you need to change your care provider immediately. There is no time to waste. This shouldn't be a game played on anyone's terms but yours. When you find the right caretakers you will know immediately. Do not let insurance, money or red tape prevent you from getting the treatment you deserve. This is your only shot. There is always a way. Find those hands that you trust your life in and willingly give it to them. They will quickly bring you a sense of calm. They will spend time answering your questions. There will be no stupid questions to them. They won't do anything besides make you feel like you are the most important life that exists. They will never make you feel like they don't have things in control. They will be honest and accessible at all times. They might even become your friends. They deserve your gratitude, respect and appreciation daily. If you get upset at them during treatment know that they'll forgive you. They get that you're going through something they can't imagine - but they understand better than anyone. They see it every day and they choose to be there because they want to make the worst experience of your life more tolerable.

You will need to find balance after treatment. Start by seeking balance during treatment. Eat well. Sleep well. Listen to your body. Experiment with new forms of exercise that aren't so demanding. Do not be too proud to speak to someone. You cannot afford to store up the intensity of the emotion that comes with fighting a life-threatening illness. Let it out for yourself. You will begin to hear your voice changing. That voice is who you are becoming in the face of mortality. Listen to that voice. It will be the purest, most authentic version of you that you have ever known. Bring that person into the world -- strengths and vulnerabilities and everything between. Be that person forever.

You will inspire others. It will feel weird. People you haven't spoken to since grade school will be in touch. Ex-boyfriends, former colleagues... even people you felt never wanted to talk to you again. The influx of interest in your seemingly fading life will be greater than any living moment you have ever experienced. That support is what will shift a fading life into a surviving one. Be grateful for every message. Be appreciative of each gift and each visit. There will be moments where all of this attention will make you feel lonelier than you have ever felt in your life. In a hospital room full of people with messages stuffing your inbox, voicemail and mailbox you will find yourself feeling completely alone. This is when you will realize that you could afford to have a stronger relationship with yourself. That only you walk this earth with 100% investment in you. Make the investment and use this as an opportunity to reexamine your self-worth. Love yourself more than ever and recognize how much love there is for you in the world. Then start sharing that love. You will come to see that even when you are the neediest person you know you can still be giving. Giving will make you feel better than taking.

When you get to the other side you won't believe it. They will tell you the disease is gone. Everyone you know will rejoice and return to their lives. You'll constantly wonder if it is coming back. Slowly this feeling will fade, but cancer will always be a part of you. It will define how you see the world moving forward. You're going to feel like the future is a funny thing to think about because the present is going to suddenly seem incredibly important. Keep moving. You'll be more productive. You'll understand who truly loves you because they will still be there. You'll want to meet new people that connect to the newly evolved version of your old self. You'll want to let go of those that don't ""get"" who you are now. You'll feel a little guilty doing it. Then, you'll move on. You don't have time to waste. The greatest gift you've been given is that you now understand that and you're going to make the most of every second. You're going to be the most passionate person you know going forward. Translate that passion to a greater purpose. Be fearless again.""",2014-10-11 02:44:22

      All of you don’t know me but we are here for the same reason, we have all been affected by cancer one way or another. My name is Jacob R. and I am 14 years old . In 2018 my family moved up to where we live now in central California and we’re living a pretty good life up here until around late April of 2019. My mom started seeing complications in her health, we went to the hospital and she was diagnosed with pneumonia and blood clots she was then treated for those things. We saw the hospitals out two more time and it was all going uphill. We were at my 8th grade promotion and she was off of oxogen the entire time and after we had fun, we barbecued, we told stories, etc. Summer started and 4 days in, she had a stroke and was airlifted to west hills hospital. We were there for 31 days. While there we learned that the “pneumonia and blood clots” was a non-small cancer ALK1+. With this news we looked at all of the treatments and saw that there were so many advances in this field and I was so happy that hopefully in a few month life would be normal again. We got out of the hospital and the road to recovery began. We had a few bumps in the road but we were making more progress. Eventually we had learned that the cancer had spread to the brain from the lungs. With this, we started chemotherapy. This was all looking good and it was really kicking cancers ass. Life was looking normal again. We made it all the way through 2019 with December being one of the best months since diagnosis. She was out with friends and family almost everyday and was beginning to act like herself again. Then the new year hit, we saw a weird decline and some pain, we went to the hospital and they said it was nothing but a pulled muscle. We went on with everything and then around the 22 of January,  it was too much pain to bear. She went back to the hospital with my dad leaving me to run the household and take care of my brother(age 12) we got through the week and went to see her everyday after school. January 30th I went to school and about 30 minutes in I was pulled out and checked my phone with a text from my dad saying “Love you all so much” I knew something had gone wrong at this point. We got to the hospital and we talked about how the cancer had spread beyond the lung and brain and now was in the lower spine, liver, and ribs. She was in unbearable pain and my dad told me she only had a few days left. With this knowledge I had no idea how to react as I am only 14 and the thought of that scared me. That day, I only left her bedside to go use the restroom or eat and the rest of the time I was right there, with her and my dad. We had numerous people come and go and the nurses told us that they had never seen so much love and support for one person. She was heavily sedated but completely out of pain. Earlier that day was the last time I got to talk to her and her last words to me were “hi, love you”, around 9pm, we took her off of her bigger oxogen mask and put her on a regular O2 tube. We knew once we did this, she would only have 4-5 hours left. We did this and those were the last few hours I got with her. At 2:38 in the morning I watched her take her last breath and pass over to the next world. I couldn’t bear the fact I had just lost my mom, someone who has been in my life since the beginning. I was so sad and so was everyone else. I don’t really know how to end this because I can’t think straight and I can’t stop crying so sorry. But I do want to say, don’t take anything for granted. If your friends or family, or whoever has cancer, spend as much time with them as you can. You will be so happy about that in the end. I spent as much time as I could with her and I am happy to be left with those memories I shared with her. I am sorry to anyone who has lost someone and I wish the best of luck to anyone fighting the battle.",2020-02-02 14:55:54

The pain of losing a parent to this disease,71,erx99m,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/erx99m/the_pain_of_losing_a_parent_to_this_disease/,26,1579653980.0,"I remember when I first found out my father was diagnosed. He hid a lot from me to protect me from the bad news. I don’t blame him. I remember he would go days without talking to me because he didn’t want me to see him going bald from the chemo. He didn’t want me to watch him die. He loved me so much. 

I left for California for a few weeks and came back to him in the hospital. I never would have went to California if I knew that was going to be the last time I saw my father outside of a hospital. I didn’t see him for weeks. When I came back, I got the news that he was jaundice. I ran to the hospital and he was so yellow, so skinny, throwing up, and just angry at the world. 

The damn doctors came in and started talking about hospice right in front of him. I was the only one who had faith he’d get better. 

My family tried to talk some sense into me, but I refused to believe he was dying. He’s my father, he raised me, he’s not dying. 

I remember trying to let loose at the club, but was just always constantly looking at my phone. I started crying in the club and just lost it. 

The morning before he died, I gave him a speech, he was so high off drugs but I knew he could hear me. I told him how much I loved him and how I promised to take care of things. My nose started to bleed from crying so hard. I told him to wait for me for when I got out of work. He did. I held his hand and watched him take his last breath. 

Everyone was crying, but I just couldn’t. I cried in my car and screamed on my way back home. I didn’t want to cry in front of anyone. Even at his funeral, I just refused to cry. 

But I just always want to cry. The pain is still there and I miss him more than anything in the world. He made sure I was well taken care of before he left. And I will always be thankful for that. 

I wish I could cry about him to someone, but I just can’t. I want to cry in someone’s lap and just have my head rubbed. But I just can’t.

He was always so proud of me. When everyone doubted me, or thought I wasn’t capable of doing something, he was the one to support my every decision. He knew I could reach the stars. 

And now that I am, he’s not here to see it. I finally got a job that he would be so freakin proud of. I left my toxic relationship which he knew I deserved better. He always knew I deserved better. He would talk about me to his friends as if he was my biggest fan. 

My life is changing and I’m happy, but he’s not here to say “I knew you could do it”. 

Why did it have to be him? I hold no anger towards people who successfully beat cancer, but I get envious of hearing those stories. My father tried, until he just couldn’t. The chemo killed him. 

I know many people feel the pain I’m feeling - which comforts me. I’m not alone. 

I want to see him again, I want to hear his voice again, I want to hear him sneeze again, I want to feel his facial stubble again, I want to smell him again.",2020-01-22 00:46:20

I'm proud of you Dad.,69,eg8bec,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/eg8bec/im_proud_of_you_dad/,6,1577461893.0,"My Father was diagnosed with bowel cancer in early 2019.  The doctor who diagnosed him was actually the father of one of my friends, and I am forever grateful to him.  He started chemo in February, and throughout the entire session, he was incredibly brave.  In late February, a guy in my class attempted suicide in front if all of us by trying to jump out a second story window.  When I got home, my father was there.  He rapt me in his arms, and suddenly the world was okay.  That night, I really thought about what could happen in the next few months.  How my world would collapse without him.  I cried myself to sleep.  The next few months were hard, and he went in for surgery in may.  He wrote me, my brother and my mother each letters before he went in, mine saying how much he loved me and how he wanted me to have the best life possible, and not to blame the surgeon if something went wrong.  In September, he took a break from chemo to take a vacation in France.  Now we are here, the day after Christmas, and he is alive and cancer-free.  I love you Dad, and I have no idea what I would do without you.  You help me up when I fall down, and I need to thank from the bottom of my heart.

I miss my sister.,68,dqqpbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/dqqpbn/i_miss_my_sister/,9,1572758577.0,"She was the best person I've ever known.  She was always there for me.  She was always there for anyone who needed her.  She was a loving person.     
She had an ependymoma (brain cancer, near the brain stem).  It was attached to her brain stem.  When it was removed, it messed her up, pretty bad.  She was 100% fine mentally.  But just touching the brain stem can cause problems all over the body.  They had to move hers, they had to remove cancerous cells from it.  

For almost a year after the surgery, I drove her to doctor appointments and therapy sessions 5 days a week, just so she could learn how to walk, talk, and eat again.  She never walked, talked, or ate, like she did before.  She had bowel problems.  The front half of her tongue didn't work.  Her vision was messed up.  Her balance was off, so she teetered back and forth when walking.  She had so many things go wrong in her body, it was heartbreaking.  

She lived a painful, demoralizing, often embarrassing, 9 years after her surgery.       
She died four years ago today.  She was only 49.

Before starting his chemo, his CEA levels were 6.2. After the first round, they increased to 11.9. I was devastated thinking the chemo wouldn't work.

This is a long story.

I've been hemorrhaging lately, but it always seems to stop itself. Until recently. Earlier this week I got my first transfusion and thought ""whoo boy this was bad"". I was wrong. That wasn't even close.

This time... this hemorrhage... it was different. I've never called 911 before yesterday but I knew I couldn't wait. I couldn't stand and the world was disappearing before my eyes.

I got very scared, and the emts repeatedly asked if I could walk, and if my hubs could drive me. That made my hubs very angry as I was seriously ill. ""But your vitals are fine!"" they said. Not for long assholes.

They walked me down our large flight of steps, one on each side carrying me. I reach the landing, lose consciousness and vomit on myself before regaining consciousness. I have never fainted before. 

By the time I made it into the rig, my vitals had already begun to drop. They told me I was so pale my skin was transparent. For reasons unbeknownst to me, mr ball leg decided to begin hurting more than I've ever experienced. Great timing asshole. 

I have never been closer to death than during that ambulance ride. I could barely stay awake and couldn't even lift my damn arms or head. I honestly thought ""This is it. I'm gonna die next to an asshole emt that didn't even believe me."" Luckily that was not the case. 

I received emergency blood (2 units) and dilaudid. I finally started to feel human again. But of course the hemorrhage was still occurring. 

After staying in this er for 7-9 hours I got transferred to the better equipped hospital and received an emergency cauterization surgery as well as some sort of liquid adhesive. The bleeding is finally under control for now and I'm receiving 3 more units of blood. My veins are all shot and have only 2 good ivs in all the attempts. My arms look like bruised pin cushions. One had to be given under general during surgery. 

I just want to reach a point in my radiation where the bleeding is finally under control. I fear I'll never get there. I apologize, I'm in a dark place today.

This was a procedure where they sent a scope down his wind pipe into his lungs to take a biopsy from both sides of his chest. We have a new oncologist that suspects the original diagnosis of metastasis in the chest may actually be infection. Not a super simple procedure but all went great. 
On the way home, my husband noticed a man on the ground while someone tried to perform CPR. Being a Fireman he insisted we pull over where he jumped out and took over until the ambulance arrived. The man was VSA when he got to him but he did manage to get his pulse back. I am so super proud of him, I just wanted to share.

Since I was rather medicated I had not paid attention to what the nurses did with the drainage tubes. I didn't even know they were there. They safety-pinned them to my velcro wrap.

So off I go to the bathroom, pull down my pants and I did not realize the safety pin had come undone. All of a sudden, these two big plastic ball-like hand grenades fall (almost) to the floor. The tubes were not long enough to touch the floor. They sat there swinging back and forth.

His name is Thomas (not posting last name for privacy, the form should accept it without the last name). They are in Room #48 in the PICU. In your message, please include the country/state/city you are writing from. It makes them feel happy to know that people from all over the world are thinking about Thomas and sending them love.

"She's not gone yet, but I miss my Mom so much.",70,coszf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/coszf9/shes_not_gone_yet_but_i_miss_my_mom_so_much/,23,1565530128.0,"3 months ago. My mom was perfectly healthy. She never got sick, and if she got a cold or something she'd drink some tea and be okay again. I was finishing up school and my Mom was so excited for my summer vacation, and my Dad was the only sick person of the family, with glaucoma and diabetes. Mom always took care of him. 

My Mom's urine started turning yellow, and she'd never had yellow urine. Her entire life it'd been clear, she was always hydrated. She went to the doctor, after not having gone for maybe 6 years. Her eyes started turning yellow, and she got extreme, extreme itching. I was so scared seeing her in pain. 

If any of my classmates saw this they'd make fun of me, but I've always slept in the same bed with my Mom. I know it's weird. When I was 6 I slept in the same bed as my Dad and my Mom, but then Dad got glaucoma and we were scared of hitting his eyes or something. And then I never really grew out of it, no matter how many times I said I would. The comfort of having my Mom near me, especially when I was scared of my Dad going blind, was so nice. She'd tell me stories from her kindergarten days to her college days and we'd just laugh until we fell asleep. I'm so close to my Mom, so when she was itching, it hurt me to see her in pain. 

That's also left me with adjustment issues because once she started having extreme itching, she couldn't be in the same bed as me and I could never sleep on my own. 

Maybe around June 10th she went to the doctor with my Dad, and they immediately sent her to the ER. I was terrified. They sent her to a hospital and she liked it there! I would stay with her in the day, while my Dad had work. Mom didn't work though, she's always been a housewife, so it was easy for her to take a break, but not for me and my Dad. Hell, we didn't know how to use our dishwashing for a little while. 

Then she got diagnosed with cancer, and my world fell apart. I couldn't eat at all. Just looking at food made me want to vomit. Never had I imagined a world without my Mom.

God I did so much research, but it's in the worst place, it's not operable, she can't get a transplant, and she doesn't wanna do chemo because her mother had a bad experience doing chemo for lung cancer. I cried so much. The doctors said she only had 1 year. She always tried to tell me she was gonna live for 5 more years, with the aurvedic medicine that she wanted to try. We're Indian, but we live in the US, by the way. 

She had a surgery to put what I think is called a catheter in her right and life bile ducts. Her blood pressure went down, and she was put in the ICU. She was depressed. I had never seen her so depressed. She could barely eat. And the doctors said she had 3-6 weeks. (It's been like 7 weeks after this and my Mom's still alive) My Dad was debating putting her in hospice. I was broken. I didn't think I could ever live without my Mom, especially not at my age. I'm only 14. 

We somehow got her to go to India. My Dad went with her in business class seats on a flight, which cost him a lot of money, but was most definitely worth it, because she's doing better there. Surrounded by friends and family, and is eating a lot. 

She's in some hospital in India, and I've been able to distract myself from the scary word that is cancer, because every adult is telling me she has like 5 more years, and because it's want to hear, I believe them naively. I still video call her every day though. But, I was hoping maybe they could operate on it there, and cure her, but even there they can't do it. I don't know why I thought it'd be any different. Now they can't do chemo though, she's apparently too weak. She wants to try aurvedic medicine, but that's no replacement for chemo and radiation I don't think. I just don't wanna lose my Mom. I love her so much, and god I hate sounding selfish. Is it selfish to want more time? 

I still can't sleep on my own. It was so much easier with her. I could fall asleep easy then, now I stay up till late hours in the night, I'm literally writing this at 1 am. I really miss my Mom. And I'm such a baby, needing to be in the same bed as her Mom but everything has gotten harder since she hasn't been here for me. 

My Dad has had to rewrite everything, like his will and stuff. He tells me about what'll happen if he and my Mom die, and god that's one of my greatest fears. He was sure of the fact he would die first, but now we can't be sure of anything. I've also debated therapy to cope with everything, but he thinks it'll cause more problems. 

I just want everything to go back to the way it was, but it's too much to ask for. I hope I don't sound selfish. My head is pounding just thinking about her. Everything is so overwhelming. 

I've wrote on this sub-reddit before, this exact same story, but this includes much more detail, and I really needed to get this stuff out, I'm feeling hopeless right now.

I’m so scared it’s the end stage.,64,b2eucg,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/b2eucg/im_so_scared_its_the_end_stage/,21,1552916027.0,"EDIT: 3/22/2019 5:48am - RIP MAMA - she passed peacefully in her sleep this morning 



My mother learned she had stage 4 head and neck baseloid squamous small cell carcinoma in November of 2012. February 2013 she had a radical neck dissection to remove cancer in the tonsil and lymph nodes and cancer strangling the jugular and carotid artery. The surgeon amazingly replaced her trap muscle vein/artery during surgery to her neck. She did chemotherapy after and 30+ rounds of radiation to the neck. She carried on in some pain and discomfort for quite some time and was in remission. For 5 years. November 2017 rolls around and she has a very slight pain in her left hip. Her primary care said it’s nothing to worry about. On a follow up visit to the neurologist she mentioned the pain and the doctor said “What? Really? When is your next oncologist appointment? You should go right away to get it checked out. Bam. 5 years removed and there it is. Metastatic bone cancer to the acetabulum. She did 10 rounds of radiation to the hip in January 2018 and 8 rounds in April 2018. The lesion hadn’t grown. Come around mid 2018 the lesion began to grow. We did 10 treatments of Keytruda til about November 2018. The cancer was not going to listen. The PET scan in December 2018 came back showing the Keytruda was ineffective and the lesion has grown, metastasized to the rib, spine, and now liver. My mom had lost quite some weight during this time. But the news was devastating. My mom has been in excruciating pain for over a year from bone cancer. It is the worst thing ever imagine able. There is no quality of life. The oncologist gave her the option to do chemo or look into hospice care. My mom wasn’t anywhere near healthy or ready to do more chemo to get sick as a dog and not be able to spend what quality time she has left. We chose the hospice route. The scariest part is, this past week or two everything has declined. My mom can no longer get up by herself, she sometimes incontinent, she is now very confused and most certainly hallucinating things. I have learned to go along and not frustrate/irritate her by calling her out that she’s hallucinating. The constant confusion is messing me up terribly. Just today she said she can’t talk and was whispering instead. I check on her many times to make sure she’s okay. I’m always by her side and here for her. It’s just tough knowing I have close family that has no idea what I’m really going through. It’s just my mother and I with my grandmother across the street. Most of my family in another city a couple hours away. I feel like after reading the stages of the end of life cycle, too many seem familiar. She has become unrecognizably skinny although I  try to make sure she can eat as much as she can throughout the day. She’s starting to have a hard time even holding her medicines and swallowing fluids. I’m extremely scared my mom may only have days to live. There’s people in my family who will not be able to comprehend how my loving mother now cannot hold a conversation but rather only responds and peacefully looks at you then says something random. She forgets what she says. I love my mom so much and I’ve been here every step of the way. Fuck cancer. Never wish it on my worst enemy. I just feel dumbfounded on how much has changed and how my mom is now a shell of what she always used to be. I love her with all my heart and soul.",2019-03-18 13:33:47
Coping with terrible “support system”,69,awk756,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/awk756/coping_with_terrible_support_system/,33,1551577529.0,"This is mostly a vent, but also hoping to find people who understand. As you can see, stage 3 vulvar cancer and I’m only 29.

I started treatment about 2 weeks ago, having my surgery to remove the cancer and evaluate my lymph nodes. Apparently, the primary tumor had grown so rapidly in between my exam and the surgery that what was supposed to be a partial radical vulvectomy turned into a total radical vulvectomy (and bilateral lymph nodes dissection). Because of the more extensive surgery, I was in the hospital for a week instead of 3 days.

My partner was able to take 2 weeks off from work, so he was home the entirety of my hospital stay and the majority of this week (he just went back to work today). When I was in the hospital, he managed to keep up with the house and take care of our son without issue. Since I’ve been home, he’s immediately gone back to his cleaning regimen of “don’t pick anything up until AITAthrowaway90 is so sick of it that she stops asking for help around the house and just cleans it by herself”. But I can’t just do all the housework myself, I just had major surgery and I’m still mostly in a wheelchair. I’ve been able to pick up a few things around the house by rolling around and using my grabber, but essentially it just went to shit. We’ve also gotten into stupid disagreements this week that culminated in him screaming at me for 5-10 minutes and him saying I’m “always negative and make him miserable”. That really hurt, a lot. I always try to encourage him in things he does, tell him qualities I like about him, give him praise, etc, and that’s never reciprocated. The only thing he tells me about how he views me is that I’m negative/terrible/etc and make him miserable (along with typical “love you’s). I ended up having a breakdown and just sobbed.

Well, he went back to work today, so his parents are helping me take care of our child. Things generally were ok, until my physical therapist showed up for our session today. I guess they thought they were quiet enough, but they decided it was a good time to talk shit about how “I’m keeping the house” and “milking” my cancer right now. The thing is, they weren’t quiet, both me *and my physical therapist* heard them. He got a look of horror that they would really sit there and say that, thinking we can’t hear them, then pretend to be all smiles when we ended up walking near them during my session. I feel embarrassed, pissed, and betrayed TBH (they never gave me any indication they thought so poorly of me before).

I’m just tired of all of this. I’ve literally been home for a week and we’re only two weeks into treatment. I still have chemo and radiation I’m going to have to go through, and this apparently is the life I’m fighting to save?

I just want to disappear right now, but I can’t because I can’t even walk down the stairs on my own. Clearly, I’m going to have to re-evaluate the hell out of my relationships if this is what I get to deal with on top of cancer. ",2019-03-03 01:45:29

I was put on the oncology floor. The doctor said it looked like cancer had spread all over my abdomen. I got here and they convened multiple teams like infectious disease, rheumelogy, infectious disease, gynecology, and  oncology. Yesterday I had a biopsy surgery and they said based on tumor markers and my age (I’m only 34) it looks like ovarian cancer but I gotta need to keep waiting to get the official results. I’m getting a chest CT to see if it’s spread to my chest this morning.

I'm 23 and I'm stage 4 and it's not looking great. I'm incurable so even if I win this round I won't be safe for long. Now I'm young af and this whole experience has really sucked for my family but what I've been stuck on is how, in every piece of media ever and basically all real-life examples I know, the person is dying is an old person, so while it is a sad event there is this undercurrent of 'well they've lived their life'. There's nothing for young people. There's nothing for people who went to school and university and were just getting started on their life. And I don't know how not to be sad that I'm dying young. I don't want to die young. I don't want to die at all. And yeah I know my feelings are fucking valid, but it's going to break my father's heart to watch me die and me being fixated on living is going to make it all worse. I don't know how to swallow my sadness and make it so my family doesn't have to watch my heart break alongside theirs. Losing a loved one leaves a lot of damage. I want to minimise it.

A personal story,66,8jgaze,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/8jgaze/a_personal_story/,27,1526364105.0,"Hi everyone. Just wanted to share my story because I'm really alone and don't have many friends.

2 months ago, I lost my jeep in an explosion, went through a break-up and then was diagnosed with stage II testicular cancer all within the same week.

I found this sub today and am filled with emotion just reading everyone's stories. I'm scheduled to begin chemo next week after I have a port placed in my chest on friday. I'm 23.

Cancer showed me how little I know about this world. How little I know about what's correct or incorrect to do with your life or even your next week.

However, I decided that the purpose of life is to love those around you. And I am sitting here on my laptop at a cafe in seattle with tears welling up and I wish I could hug each and every one of you. I don't know you but I still feel a connection. I don't know what the point of this post was. I suppose I just felt the need to spill my soul. I've been very reserved with my diagnosis, only telling my close friends and my family. I deleted my social media accounts. So, to have a place where I can talk about my diagnosis and not feel like it's some sort of fucked up 'bragging' or dick-measuring contest is so relieving.

The worst part of cancer for me is seeing people's reactions when I share my diagnosis. Why did I have to be the one to bring sadness into someone else's life? I would much rather make someone smile or laugh. :( In that respect, I would rather not tell someone so that they can continue in happiness rather than be emotionally unbalanced because of my life. I do not wish to cause worry in anyone's life.

I don't know why there is so much pain in this world. But all things come to an end and whether we live or die, if we love those around us we are doing the right thing and no one can take that away from us, no one.

So to everyone reading this, let's spread our love as much as we can to everyone who will have it. Our love will never die :)",2018-05-15 06:01:45
The lady in the airport on the way home,65,8gzjo5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/8gzjo5/the_lady_in_the_airport_on_the_way_home/,6,1525471968.0,"My wife and I were returning from a trip to see family in the Northeast, in January, and we sat on a bench to rest while waiting for a connecting flight. I didn't mean to hear this, or know this, but I did, because of where we chose to stop walking, when we did.

A woman in her 30's stood a few feet away and made a phone call, to her husband. I heard her say she got the results, and then she began crying softly. She said, ""This isn't the best way to have this conversation, I wish you were here."" She said, ""It will be different, but we'll get through this."" She mentioned a child at some point. They talked a couple minutes, and she said ""I'll see you when I get home. I love you, too."" 

I wondered what the odds were that I'd be standing in that spot, at that time, and hear that conversation. I wanted to tell her that we were on the same journey, and ask if she had any questions. I wanted to give her a hug. I didn't do any of that, because I was sitting there crying myself, behind my sunglasses, and imagining a time my wife had to make similar phone calls, stuck in my own pain, and I wasn't a picture of encouragement for anyone at that moment.

So, to the lady in the airport, please forgive me for my accidental eavesdropping on your conversation, and forgive me for not at least trying to ease your pain in that moment. And also thank you, for reminding me we're not the only ones going through this, and not the only ones who need help sometimes.

Thanks to everyone here. If I read your post, if I've corresponded with you, or you made a helpful comment. Your stories remind me of my own, and my family's. Thanks for being a place where I don't hear, ""We're praying for you, you're going to beat this thing!"" or any of the other platitudes and bullshit you hear in the real world. I have family and friends I can talk to, but there are things you can't say to them. I don't go to a support group or therapy, this is what I've got. There are so many people who have less than this, who don't have family or friends to help them or their loved ones, and I'm feeling really grateful for you guys today. ",2018-05-04 22:12:48

Or when she would get up early in the morning just to prep a lunch for me without asking. Or how she'd wake me up on my birthday by singing Happy Birthday in her broken English. Oh she was kind, loving, and caring to everybody around, so none of that was ever a big surprise. God, I'll forever miss her...

But I'm posting this to remind everyone battling this disease, directly or as a caregiver, to spend as much time with loved ones as you possibly can. I know sometimes that isn't easy for various reasons, but the comfort and love of those dear to you can ease the rough and uncertain journey that is cancer. Stay strong everyone and keep loving.

General annoyances as a teen cancer survivor,67,851ehs,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/851ehs/general_annoyances_as_a_teen_cancer_survivor/,35,1521288297.0,"So today I saw Jumanji with my friend (great movie btw) It was actually the second time I had seen a movie with him, the first being during chemotherapy and it was kinda awful ngl. I was exhausted and had to pee every 45 mins, my neulasta thing was flashing and I just wasn’t feeling myself. So going today and feeling pretty good and like myself showed me how far i’d come since July.

Well before the movie started, there was a preview for “Midnight Sun,” a movie about a girl who is “allergic” to the sun, meaning she can’t go out in the day or she could die. I’m not sure what it’s called, but it’s a real thing. Well low and behold when she’s out at night she meets a guy and they fall in love and her life turns all dandy after sucking for so long.

Now, I know this is not the same thing as cancer, but it reminded me of the Fault in our Stars, how Hazel Graces life sucked until she met Augustus.

But it makes me so mad. Because that’s not what it’s like to be a teenager with a life threatening illness. Maybe for one person, but i bet for the overall population, it’s more pain and isolation than having some guy come and rescue us from all the bad things we’ve been through. 

I wish it were that easy. I wish some guy could come in and make me feel better and stop the depression and the puking and aching and hospital stays. But that’s not reality. at All.

It’s a silly thing to be dumb about but I wish if people were to make movies about teenagers with serious illnesses and diseases, the movie would truly be about our experiences rather than a romanized idea of it. ",2018-03-17 12:04:57

It hasn't been easy but I have been getting weened off medications and all previous tests since engraftment have shown remission.

Unfortunately my father lost his short battle with cancer in the early hours of this morning. It has gutted me. The hospital did let me spend the last few days with him, even though they are in full lock down due to the pandemic, which i am extremely grateful for. I got the call from the staff nurse on his ward this morning. And again, they let go up to the ward and spend a bit of time with him. He was tested for the coronavirus twice during his hospital admission. Both swabs came back negative for coronavirus.

I had to make arrangements with an undertaker this morning, and this is where the problems began. First they wanted £2k upfront. I'm on welfare, so the best i could do was £600 and i applied for help from the UK government. 

Then because of the pandemic, the UK government has put quite a few restrictions on funerals, whether the person died of the the virus or not. I can't have him home and i can't have a viewing at the funeral parlour. I can't have them dress him in a suit, i'm only allowed five family members at the graveside, and we can only have a minister say a few words at the graveside instead of a normal service.

My grandmother is in self isolation due to her age and she is gutted that she can't come to her own son's funeral. And i'm beside myself with grief.",2020-04-08 05:06:57
