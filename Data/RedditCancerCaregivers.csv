She’s asleep and it’s raining outside. She sleeps a lot, to be honest. Partly from the incredibly high pain medication, plethora of anti-nausea medicine, and just physical exhaustion from cancer and chemotherapy. 

It’s a really isolating thing; to be in a room with her infusion pump humming and rain pattering on the window. Free from any distractions and alone with your thoughts. It’s like you’re locked in a box with sadnesss. You’re there on your own volition, of course, because obviously it’s *your wife*, but it’s just this thing you can’t escape. It’s why there aren’t good days. The fog of despair is too thick and too persistent. It’s this constant and your mind drifts to surgeries, reoccurrence, and words like *metastasis* and *survival rate*.

Cancer fucking sucks. Feeling helpless sucks. Depression sucks. Feeling disconnected from the world sucks. People checked in during the first few weeks, but that tapers off because cancer is a marathon of a fight.",2019-12-07 23:41:51

If your loved one was recently diagnosed or you are struggling with coping- Lessons I have learned to survive the past 2 1/2 years.,25,acyf35,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/acyf35/if_your_loved_one_was_recently_diagnosed_or_you/,5,1546751990.0,"A little background:

My father, who has been the most influential person in my life, was diagnosed with stage 4 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer in the liver) on May 20th, 2015. He was 62.
The average prognosis for his stage was 6 months. We have been unbelievably lucky to still have my father with us, although we know the end can come at anytime.
I’m an only child and my parents have been married for 44 years. The three of us have been each other’s primarily support structure.
10 years ago, I never thought I could have survived this long without going crazy between the grief and the unknowns indefinitely. 
I realized that was not an option. There is no one size fits all solution, but hopefully some of the ways I have learned to deal with it will help someone else. (Also, I work in the medical field which has had some influence on what I have been able to help with.)

This is the mindset I maintain on good/ regular days (forget bad days, it all goes out the window):

1. I refuse to accept any type of specified timeframe for prognosis- which I am glad I did because he beat that timeframe multiple times over. It’s not that I am unrealistic, but life is unpredictable and I see it as not being over until it’s over. I promised my dad when he was diagnosed that I would go to the ends of the earth to find treatment options as long as he wants to continue to fight and will continue to do so for as long as possible.

2. I try very hard to stay focused on today when I think about my dad. Other than doing the research to make sure I always have a plan b option in the back of my mind for him, I try to look at it as today he is alive and when I am with him I stay focused on that moment.

3. I tell myself that I will have all the time in the world to grieve once that final day comes but until then, I am going to be rock strong for him, celebrate any positive news (a day with more energy, a better lab result, anything), and try to put a positive spin on something when he is having a rough day emotionally while still validating his feelings- it’s his right to feel however he feels, but if I can find anything that might make it seem a little less bleak, I will throw it out there.

4. I never question why. I keep it very simple and just accept that it is what it is, I don’t know why, and if I started to question why I would become angry at the injustice of it.

5. When I feel myself becoming overwhelmed with my emotions consistently without a break, I try to take a break when it’s possible. For me, that is usually having a day completely alone to clear my head, do nothing, and try to recenter myself and my perspective. I get out my emotions and I journal my thoughts into my phone. For myself, being an only child and not having anyone else in a similar situation thus far, I have used journaling as my way of getting it out. My mom and I talk about different stuff at times, but I don’t put any of my grief on her- she has more than enough on her plate.

6. I do my best to avoid feeling guilty in any way about anything with my dad. I know he knows how much I love him and that I am there for anything he needs whether he asks or not. This allows me to know that after each visit, if it’s the last time I ever see him, I am going to be okay with our ending.

7. When he was diagnosed I created a bucket list of things I wanted to say or do for him during the time we have left. One by one I have checked those things off my list.

My heart breaks for anyone who is diagnosed or has a loved one diagnosed with cancer. It’s a journey that can’t be imagined unless you actually experience it.",2019-01-06 05:19:50

Metastasized osteosarcoma and it’s been deemed inoperable, so we’re pursuing proton radiation with Mayo.

We married after her cancer diagnosis and we’re a blended family, both bringing a child into the relationship. I have a 7 year old daughter and she has a 6 year old son. She was a widow, so her son would have no biological surviving parent or other family in the state, so I’m going to legally adopt him. 

We’re 7 months into our cancer journey and it’s been far and away the most exhausting and crushing period of my life. More so than losing a parent or divorce.

Every doctor I’ve talked to, every book I’ve read, and every article I’ve clipped stresses the need for self care. That caregivers need to give themselves time outside of their lives, for them, specifically to refill your own cup. The problem is, with me holding down the household, there’s very little functional time and when I do try and advocate for it with my wife I’m met with hostility and hurt feelings. Insecurities that I’m trying to “get away” from her or hate our “cancer life”.

I realize that her emotions are more about cancer, losing herself, and dying, but it still sucks to not have any piece of my life for me. I wake up, make breakfast for the kids, get them to school, work, balance her needs and support her treatments, and try to ensure she gets as much as I can give her on an empty tank after they go to bed, but it’s still not enough for her.

I’m left in this lonely hellish existence, unable to even go to the gym or step away for a beer. Even if I go into my office to draw or something, I’m trying to “get away” from her.

I live 1500 miles away from my family, my brother and mom live in the same town as my dad.

2 weeks ago my dad was admitted to ICU with critically low pulse oxygen reading, I flew here on the first flight the next morning. For 5 days my dad was stuck in ICU with very few answers. He'd been feeling bad for about a month or month and a half but with the Covid situation his doctors wouldn't see him for ""non-emergency care"". After the ICU stay he was thankfully released, I thought I would never see him again. After scans and biopsies the diagnosis was anaplastic thyroid cancer which has spread to his lungs, liver, and bones as well. Treatment was not suggested, nor was it desired by my dad when all outcomes led to death from the disease with decreased quality of life on the way there.

So here I am, 1500 miles from my home with my life on pause while my mom and brother go about their lives as usual and stop by once every couple of days to check in. This has been such a heavy load to bear alone. I've been by my dads side almost every hour of every day since I've been here. I've valued the time we have had together so much but it is just getting so heavy. I gave him his first dose of morphine tonight and he is still uncomfortable. I know he is scared and it is getting so hard to keep my composure and not show him how terrified I am too. I see him get a little weaker every single day and I feel like a part of me is dying along with him. I just don't know how life will ever be the same again. 

I feel so terrible because part of me hopes he is able to let go soon so the pain ends, so that I can start to openly grieve him in a way I feel like I can't while he is still alive because I need to be his rock. I just never thought that being his caretaker would be my responsibility and duty. It's something I never even prepared myself for mentally and it just hit me like a ton of bricks.

Fast forward to now. 10months since his last chemo. His tumor marker skyrocketed. July it was 0, last Thursday 14,900. 


He didn’t want to look at the report, he wanted to wait till we talked to the oncologist. But, I had to look. It’s been 4 days that I’ve known and he hasn’t. We were told a relapse would mean no more cure, just trying to extend life.


His hip has been bothering him, keeping him up at night. He stretches all the time, calling it muscle pain. I know what it is. It’s a tumor in his pelvis. 


Everyday this fast growing cancer is getting worse. It’s been the weekend, then today a holiday so his oncologist office is closed. I can’t tell him but I’m worried he won’t get the palliative chemo in time. I’m worried he won’t even take it once he finds out.

However, late in 2018 he was diagnosed with head and neck cancer, had surgery, went through chemo and radiation, and became gravely ill.

I do all of it. I work at home, I care for him, I clean, I do the meals, etc.  Recently he became incontinent, and now he is down to 160 lbs after weighing over 300 when first diagnosed.  He had a PET scan, and new cancer has been found in his lung and his colon.

He asked me if he was dying, and I was honest and told him that I thought he may be, but there is always hope.  Now he doesn't want to talk about it, but goes back and forth about not wanting to live like this and wanting to fight.

I know it is his choice, I KNOW he has to make a decision, but he can no longer walk by himself, he can no longer dress himself, clothe himself, change his pull up, change the bed, make his meals, ANYTHING.  I am no sure what to do, although I have talked to the SW and she is sending in household help so that I get some time.  The VA is also sending in a home health aide (thank GOD for the VA)

So what do I do now? We have discussed Hospice, but he is not ready for it yet, but if he can't put weight back on, they WILL put the PEG back in.  The oncologist is waiting for the newest biopsy results to see what type of cancer we are dealing with, but he just keeps going downhill, and I don't know how to help him anymore other than just being here.",2020-07-31 04:43:52

My friend died . . . .,13,dommln,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/dommln/my_friend_died/,3,1572364382.0,"I had known Jenah for 4 years.  We would travel to meet each other and spend time together. A year after meeting her on the internet she was diagnosed with lung cancer, stage 2 nonsmall cell.  I stayed in touch with her and supported her throughout this.  Her husband was considering retiring but stayed with the company he was with for the insurance.  Jenah had cervical cancer years before but had a hysterectomy to remove that cancer.  A lobectomy showed that this was not the same cancer that had been in her lady parts.  In August she came to Knoxville and we spent some time together, she was not very mobile due to her condition.  She wanted this to be special, but she just couldn't make it what she had wanted, she feared that this was going to be our last time together. I told her she could beat this cancer.  I did my best to be supportive.

&#x200B;

She went back to Wisconsin and we talked almost daily.  She went into the hospital after a new trial of a cancer treatment sent her immune system into a massive attack on all of her body.  They gave her immunosuppressant medications and she came back.  Several of her Oncologists said they were wondering how they were able to talk to her, that she should be dead by all rights.  She laughed it off saying that she was weird like that.  From the hospital, they moved to a palliative care center for her to recover.  It eventually became hospice care, but I was never told this.

&#x200B;

On the morning of October 22, my birthday, while I was at work at my security job, she called me.  She was coughing a lot.  She told me she didn't know how much time she had, I told her we could talk more if she needed to, but she said no, not talk time, real-time.  She said it could be 30 minutes from now, three days, a week, but she knew she wasn't going to make it to Christmas.  I tried to say things but she told me to be quiet.  She said she loved me, that she always wondered why I had stayed in this relationship with her after she developed this cancer.  She told me that she was having a friend send me a few things that I had sent her and given her, a stuffed animal T-Rex, a t-shirt and a few other things.  I asked her if she knew how it was going to happen, was she going to be put on higher dose pain killers to make her comfortable.  She said she was not aware of that nor was she aware of a lot of other things.  I kept myself together as best that I could and said my goodbyes.  After that call ended, I cried.  I ugly cried and screamed and yelled why.  Then I asked whatever greater being there was to not let her die this day.

&#x200B;

I got the message from one of her friends on the 23rd at 6 pm that she was gone.  I cried again.

Having a hard time,13,cld506,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/cld506/having_a_hard_time/,5,1564826016.0,"Hey all. Having a hard time here and just need to let it all out a bit. I hope that’s okay. 

My (F30) fiancé (M29) was diagnosed with stage 4 testicular cancer end of February. Now most people respond to that as “well if you are going to have any cancer, that’s the one to have”. But he is one of the 1% of testicular cancer patients that has pure Choriocarcinoma. Extremely aggressive and much less responsive to treatment. He also didn’t have a mass he could have felt, it skipped right over his actual testis and to a mass around his aorta, his liver and lungs. 

Got off to a shit start, hospitalized (total of 2 weeks) and started chemo within days, on 15L of oxygen and the oncologist told us she wasn’t sure he was going to make it through the first round of chemo. 
He did, and he recover well, really well, as much as you can for going through chemo. He even went to the gym a couple times between each of his 4 rounds of chemo.

When he finished the fourth round we started making weekly visits to Sloan Kettering to get a surgery to remove the mass in his abdomen around his aorta. They wanted to wait to see the tumor marker drop to normal and it slowly was. 6 weeks later it’s still dropping, almost normal, so they schedule the surgery for 2 weeks later. We tell everyone our August 17th wedding is still on and start getting everything going again.

5 days before the surgery, we get a phone call, his marker is going up, surgery is canceled. This means he has to do high dose chemo with stem cell rescue, in NYC. We live 4 hours away, we have to leave our self employed small businesses, our home, our community and cancel our wedding. We were crushed.

3 days later, we get home from the gym, I hear a bang. He’s on the ground having a seizure (5 mins early he would have been driving us home). I’m not sure if I’m watching him die in front of me. Call 911. In the ER, they find new Mets to the brain that bled, his cancer likes to do that.

He was put on lots of steroids for brain inflammation, along with other anti seizure. He gets radiation to the brain and we continue our weekly visits to Sloan Kettering in NYC, but now to get everything in order for high dose. His tumor marker went from its low at 8 now back up to 433. 

The steroids are making him miserable, but when they tried to lower the dosage he got neurological signs of inflammation in his brain all over the left side of his body. He’s gained 20lbs, breaking out, depressed. Delayed onset of original chemo symptoms just started, bad neuropathy in both feet. 

Next week we move to NYC and live in the hope lodge for 4-6 months.

I’m scared, I’m heartbroken. I had a really rough time before I knew him. Lost my dad to cancer when I was 20, in an abusive relationship from 17-27. I worked really hard to get myself where I was when I met him, he’s amazing, smart, attractive, all the things I didn’t think I deserved in a partner, but we were going to get married and life was really good, for the first time. 

I’m so scared to loose him. I’m scared to what life looks like on the other side of this. I’m scared of what side effects and health issues he’ll have from treatment. We won’t be able to have biological children. 

I know there is no point in saying it’s not fair, it never is. Honestly, we try and stay really up beat about the whole thing, but I know we are both hitting rock bottom right now. 

I know this was long, I just needed to “say it out loud”.

My Mom Has Cancer,15,bspgyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/bspgyh/my_mom_has_cancer/,7,1558779639.0,"I made this account a few minutes ago because I'm not sure who to talk to. I have a friend who has her own shit going on with her dad and we've had a couple of laughs about our parents (very dark humor, we're both nursing students at the end of our program). And she suggested Reddit so here I go...

My mom was recently diagnosed (May 10, 2019) with stage IV colon cancer with metastasis to both lungs, both ovaries, a few glands, and liver. She completed her first round of chemotherapy and is experiencing sweats, nausea and vomiting, and overall tiredness. It's only been two weeks of me holding her hair back, monitoring her temp, and coordinating future doctor appointments and I wish it wasn't me dealing with all this. I have a younger sister who I have to watch over now. Not that I didn't before, but fixing her hair in the morning for school, speaking with her teachers regarding my mom, and everything in between now falls on me. 

Again, I wish I didn't have to and I feel so, so guilty for feeling this way.

To provide a bit of a backstory, my mom's first language is Spanish. English is a very distant second and growing up, I always had to translate for her. I always had to accompany her to school meetings, doctor appointments, to the bank, anywhere you can think of, to help her. Now, as a 20 year old, I started to dream about moving away from home... of finally, finally being on my own without having to worry about my mom or sister. At least, not worry in the way that you do when you live together. 

As for my dad, he's not around. Before the cancer diagnosis, he was kicked out of the house. My mom, after almost 21 years, finally had to courage to do it. His extracurricular activities had always affected my family and I, but for the past couple of months, he had gotten sloppy. Or maybe he didn't care to hide them anymore. That's a Pandora's box for another post or, possibly, a therapy session.

My significant other isn't in the picture either. He's been distant, both figuratively and literally. He's a military guy going through training, but due to Memorial Day weekend, he has a break and is currently at the beach. We've been together for almost three years. He has been my rock through school, family drama, and every dot in between. I bring him up only because I'm angry (not sure if that's the right word)... I'm home taking care of my mom waiting for him to reach out... only to find that he posted a beach picture on Snapchat. 

My friends are having parties to celebrate their graduation. I would've been a graduate too, but I failed my final. For reference, my mom was diagnosed on Friday and my exam was the following Monday. 

Anger may be it. I'm angry at my dad for not being the lead caretaker. I'm angry at my sister for not being older. I'm angry at my boyfriend for having fun. I'm angry at my friends for graduating when I failed. I'm angry at myself for making my mom cancer's about me. But most of all, I'm angry at the world, or God, or whatever/whomever for my mom's cancer.

My mom deserves so much more than what she's been given in life. She grew up poor. She's been sexually assaulted. She had my asshat of a dad as partner for longer than I've been alive. She's never been valued the way I think she deserves to be. (Tears are coming.) 

Her and I were planning on buying a house as soon as I graduated and got a job. We planned vacations to take over the summer. I was beginning to imagine a light at the end of tunnel for her and boom. 

Throughout all of this, no one has asked ""What took you so long to see a doctor?"" or ""Didn't you have any symptoms?"" And the answer is no. At least, not any red flag symptoms. My mom was constipated here and there, but there was never any pain or blood in her stool... it wasn't until a few months ago that she began to experience some abdominal pain. We went to her primary, an ultrasound was scheduled, and her and I were waiting for the follow-up appointment. Before we could get to it, she started experiencing some chest and back pain. I took her to the ER and a few hours later, we knew.

I'm angry for what's to come. Between what I've learned in school and (responsible) Google'ing, I know my mom is going to die sooner rather than later. In the hospital, they expressed how important it was to have hope and to be strong. I don't share what I know with my mom because I don't want to freak her out. I want her to have hope. I hold on to spending as much time as I can with her. Her and I started getting our ducks in a row as soon as she was discharged (i.e. completing an advance directive). Even if she does liver past what's expected, what will her quality of life be? Living is so much more than breathing. I love her and, despite everything I wrote, I'm happy to be the one to be there for her.

\------

Typing all of this was a bit cathartic. I didn't realize I was holding onto so much until I started crying halfway through it. I don't know how much more I'll post, but thank you Internet for providing this safe place.",2019-05-25 10:20:39

My wife has metastatic breast cancer and an anaplastic astrocytoma (brain tumor). They are both primary cancers. She's currently being treated for both and things seem to be going well (it's still too early to know, but her oncologist said the early signs are good so far).

What is not going well is her mental state. She is clearly depressed. Mood swings, she'll be happy in the morning and severely depressed by lunch. Lack of interest in doing anything other than sitting on the couch. Over and under-sleeping. All signs point to her needing help. I've brought it up several times, as have several of her doctors, but she refuses every time. She says she doesn't need someone to try and make her feel happy all the time when she knows she will die. She has convinced herself that she will die soon (despite her oncologist's optimistic outlook) and would rather spend her remaining time just sitting on the couch feeling sorry for herself.

But what can I do? I'm almost tempted to set up an appointment without her knowing and trying to force her to go to a counselor, but that just seems like a recipe for disaster. But neither can I keep going on like this.

My mom has stage 4 terminal pancreatic cancer and I'm angry.....,13,cxuieq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/cxuieq/my_mom_has_stage_4_terminal_pancreatic_cancer_and/,7,1567276491.0,"Let me preface this by saying some of this might make me sound like a horrible person. And that's ok. I cant help how I feel.  And I apologize for the length. I have to lay it all out in order to hopefully get some advice....

On Good Friday 2018, my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. Terminal.  The following Tuesday, we had her first oncology appt. In a matter of just a few days, the doctor gave mom her options. No treatment =a few months. Treatment =maybe a year. 

She asked me what I would do. I was very honest and told her I would take what God had dealt me, and have a few great months and let nature take its course (if not end my own life to not suffer) 

We talked about quality of life. And how that was the only thing I would find acceptable if I was in her shoes. And i take that sentiment VERY seriously. 

Now understand, we have lost several family members to cancer. We all watched my grandmother waste away over several years. Not something I can forget, nor do I care to witness again. 

My moms choice was to go through the treatment and fight. Great. Told her we would he by her side all the way through...and we have. 

I wont bore you with all the details of dealing with her refusing to take meds (yet claiming she wants to get every moment she can in this world) or about the aggressive treatments and all that. 

Which leads to where we are now....

About 8 weeks ago, my mom became bedridden due to a stroke (this is an important detail)  With the stroke, she lost her ability to control her right leg. So...the cancer didnt do this. The stroke did. But if you ask the oncologist, he will claim the chemo treatments are what caused the stroke. Of course all treatment has stopped. 

She is home and under hospice care. And they are wonderful! 2 nurse visits a week. And a caretaker 3 days a week to bathe her and change her bed clothes. Other than that...its all on us 3 children. 

So...this is the schedule I've been living for the last 8 weeks.....

I'm with her from Friday afternoon until midnight Sunday night ( with no relief). At midnight Sunday night,I drive 2.5 hours to work. I work until 9am in a very physical job. I then drive 2.5 hours back to mom, arriving around noon. Take care of her all day lie down at 8pm, get up at 10pm to give her meds, and lie back down. Up again at midnight and start the drive again.  I do this back and forth Monday-Friday  

In between all of that, I change her, feed her and her live in boyfriend who is now showing signs of dementia ( so I take care of him too), 5 cats, 1  dog (which is not housebroken), laundry, housework, etc. It is relentless and endless. 

Now I also have a second business that most can be done by laptop. But I do have meetings to attend. So I squeeze them in with help from my siblings. They generally take the overnight shift so I can work. (And let me tell you that they live 20.mins away....not 2.5 hours like me ) 

I looked at the calendar the other day, and realized I have slept in my own bed only 10 nights in the last 8 weeks. 

I am beyond exhausted! I'm so exhausted that there are times I cant sleep at all. I've gone as much as 36 hours with no sleep. This is how bad it has gotten. 

I've fallen asleep behind the wheel several times. And thankfully I've not wrecked. 

2 weeks ago, I sat down with my siblings and told them no more! They lived closer and needed to step up and do more.  I also explained that if I didnt take care of myself, I wont be around much longer to take care of mom. I'm going to get killed in a car accident. I see it coming! 

So now I get Tuesdays and wednesdays off.  Between them and a couple of other family members, I get 48 straight hours free. Which I use to try and maintain my own home and work. 

But I am so angry! I am finding myself holding some serious contempt for my mom. In my mind, her decision to do this was a futile one. Yes, she has lived past the year mark. But at what expense? She has ZERO quality of life. She is stuck in that bed on a catheter/diaper. Dealing with bed sores. And the only thing she can do for herself is talk and feed herself. 

Everything else is on us kids. (Mostly me)  

How do I get past feeling so bitter that her decision has led ME to have no quality of life. I was so clear at the beginning how I feel about this issue. And I dont know how to cope anymore. I swear I feel like giving up. I'm so exhausted. 

And there is no end in sight. Under hospice care, we no longer get medical tests. We have no idea where the cancer stands, nor how serious her health is.  Which makes it worst! I cant even tell my brain that we only have to do this for so long. 

I know all of this may sound selfish. But it's how I feel. And I know it sounds horrible. 

I thought about seeing a counselor. But where would I find the time? Seriously...I have none. 

I'm so damned tired.",2019-08-31 18:34:51

I’ve had a few family members and friends that have been diagnosed with cancer, and have told me that they wish they had known about this organization during their treatment/fight. 

What’s so great about IA is that they are world wide and can match you to a “Mentor Angel” who has really been in your shoes (in one or more ways). Be it the same cancer type, treatment type, age, or other circumstance, IA recognizes that cancer is multifaceted just like people.  

If you’re a caregiver and want to talk to someone who understands what you’re going through please reach out to IA, you won’t regret it. You deserve as much support as you give.",2019-05-06 01:11:29

During the stay we discovered that the Mets on his brain have increased - in my mind things are not looking good, we have failed on immunotherapy three times now, and chemo has been working but only up till now. The futures looking bleak and I want to process it. He is not willing. He thinks this is “rock bottom” and he can only get better from here. I understand and appreciate that having a positive state of mind is a good thing. But im so lonely on this side of reality - I want to talk to my best friend about it all and he’s just not willing. It breaks my heart that he has hope and I don’t. It makes me feel awful that I can’t share his optimism. I feel so guilty for thinking the worst and planning for the worst, and wanting to talk about the worst - all because I think our situation is looking pretty close to worst anyway.

"Does anyone else feel left out when their loved one is feeling ""good""?",11,hu5nds,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/hu5nds/does_anyone_else_feel_left_out_when_their_loved/,6,1595213100.0,"I've been talking to multiple people about this and I'm really struggling to feel better.

My boyfriend has cancer and has been doing treatment since April. Things are going very well and he may be getting surgery soon. We have been friends for years and started dating November of last year. He was not feeling good for a long time and finally got diagnosed in March of this year. So I've been by his side through all of it. 

What that looks like is talking to his team, helping with his parents, and helping him as much as possible. I'm also still working full time as my job hasn't been shut down. I've also been doing school and now studying for a licensing test. I've moved in that time too. So it's a lot.

What's really hurting me is days like yesterday. He got chemo on Thursday and usually he feels like shit for the next week, of course. I saw him on Friday night and brought him Lego (I do that after every round), then took him to the store so we could get something to make for dinner. Everything was good and I told him I would come over Saturday (yesterday) to be there for him and study for my test on Wednesday. We've been talking about that for the past couple weeks since I scheduled it. He was supportive of me studying with him there and bouncing things off him because that helps me remember the things I've learned. Of course I would not bother him with it if it ended up that he felt like shit and couldn't handle that.

So yesterday I go for a run in the morning/early afternoon thinking he's probably sleeping and not feeling well. When I get back he tells me he's gone out of town for a drive and to walk around another town. I was extremely hurt and upset that he would do that without me and that he just pretended to forget that the plan was for me to come over and study and then watch a movie together. I told him it feels like I am always there for him when he feels like shit and then when he feels good I'm left out. He also works on the weekends he's feeling good. So the last time we did anything fun out in public was weeks ago. 

He got really defensive, said I ruined his day, made him feel like shit, etc. I am trying my absolute best to support him at all times. I know I'm doing a pretty good job. And I do support him doing things he enjoys when he feels good. He has every day of the week to do things without me and the days I have off that he feels good he goes and does something that I have wanted to do with him since the whole thing started. 

I told him how I felt and he semi apologized. I also apologized that my first reaction wasn't that I was happy he was feeling good but honestly it wasn't my first reaction. I am still struggling not to feel underappreciated and unloved by this. He tries to tell me I need to do my own things too. And I do, but I want to spend time with him when he's good too and I don't think that's unhealthy. I really, really don't want to feel this way. 

Any help really appreciated. I'm just sad and I'm scared for what our relationship is going to look like when it's done (God willing) and he's better.",2020-07-20 02:45:00
Anyone else feeling extra protective of their loved one with cancer?,12,g2v56k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/g2v56k/anyone_else_feeling_extra_protective_of_their/,3,1587127342.0,"So long story short, my husband has stage 4 Epithelioid Sarcoma with lung metastases. To say he's in a very high risk group should he get COVID-19 is obviously an understatement. As such, we've been taking social distancing very seriously, as well as limiting our time outside of our home to walks around our neighborhood and quick trips to the grocery store (usually we use their pick up service). Thankfully neither of us have to physically report to work, so the only people we have close contact with on a regular basis is our immediate family (my husband, our son, and myself).

Unfortunately, this past Monday, my husband was rushed to the ER after a routine CT scan of his lungs indicated that he had a massive amount of fluid just outside of his right lung. He'd been having severe pain and a nasty cough for the past several weeks, but his saturated oxygen levels were good, so his doctors just told him to take it easy and increase his pain meds.

Since he had so much fluid and his heart rate was dangerously high, my husband spent both Monday and Tuesday nights in the hospital, before finally being discharged yesterday afternoon. As I'm sure you all understand, I was a nervous wreck the whole time, and couldn't wait for him to get back home to what I'd like to believe is our protective bubble (aka home).

Fast forward to today. My husband was feeling much better having had the fluid drained (nearly 4 liters) and having had a decent night's sleep at home. His parents live about 30 minutes away and his mom is a former nurse, so she offered to let him borrow a portable device that measures both O2 and heart rate (my brain is blanking on the correct name) since my husband was still concerned about his vitals. Before leaving our house, my husband arranged for his mom to set the medical equipment OUTSIDE, so as to maintain proper social distancing. He'd even offered to talk to his parents through the glass in one of their front windows.

Since I didn't feel my husband was up for driving, I drove with him and our son to his parents' place. When we got there, my son and I stayed in the car because hey, all my husband had to do was pick up a small medical device and get back into the car, right?

Nope! Not only did his mom NOT put the item outside, both she AND my father in law came outside, walked RIGHT UP TO my husband, and TRIED TO HUG HIM!!!

I nearly jumped out of the car and body slammed them both to the ground! FFS! The dude has stage 4 cancer!! WTF were they thinking?! And if even if they were magically 100% sure they themselves didn't have Coronavirus, or had been recently exposed, my husband had literally just left the hospital yesterday! What's to say he himself hadn't been exposed?

Sorry for the rant, I guess I'm just feeling super protective of my husband and family right now.",2020-04-17 12:42:22

It's not good. The cancer is on my husband's spine and has significantly reduced his motor function over the last week. We're going straight to treatment so hopefully the damage won't be permanent or get worse.

We're still incredibly lucky. We're in an area with great hospitals and doctors, the same area I was treated for my cancer, we have great insurance, and some other benefits that will help cover our deductible and max out of pocket.

Not sure why I'm posting this but I feel the need to share.. my mother has been fighting breast cancer for over 21 years. She was first diagnosed while she was still working as a pre-k teacher, lumpectomy and radiation took care of it. 5 years went by, no worries. Oops, another lump, lumpectomy on her other breaths, radiation, done.

Then 12 years went by.. though we had this fucking disease beat.. the doctors said the cancer won't kill her, it will be something else. My parents lived their lives in retirement, went traveling, saw both of their granddaughters born. Cancer never crossed our minds.. 

The past 4 years though...... horrible. Cancer reared its head and basically said,, I'm back, go to hell, you are not beating me. One mastectomy and my moms first bout with Chemo, at 79.. then the other breast and intensive chemo rounds.. she still had the will to fight and make her dream trip on the Queen Mary II across the ocean and a family vacation in Europe.. thought we had it beat again..

9 months ago, my sister took my mom to the emergency room in massive pain. It had metastasized, stage 4, game over.. except in her mind.. 9 months of chemo can break the will of anyone. My mom just decided tonight to stop the treatments, and start palliative care and hospice. We thought we were ready for this.

Mom given 2 months or less left,12,c6flpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/c6flpj/mom_given_2_months_or_less_left/,4,1561724267.0,"Hey everyone, so yesterday I was basically given an estimate on the time frame my mom has left. I am stressing badly because I have to hurry and get power of attorney over my mom and guardianship over my 33 yr old brother whom has cerebral palsy. My mom was diagnosed with COUP in October of 2018. In April of 2019 we were told the primary location was ovarian. After 8 months of fighting she is now slowly declining due to the cancer possibly spreading to her brain. Her appetite has gone down, her vision is getting worse, she’s having hallucinations and she is very confused with major anxiety. Since receiving an estimate is it wrong to start trying to plan a funeral so when that time comes I’m somewhat prepared? Mentally I’m not okay, I’m trying to stay as positive as possible but seeing my mom as a whole different person hurts so bad and seeing her lose her battle hurts even worse. We have hospice come in twice a week but have had to call the on call nurse to come a couple of times. But does anyone have advice about what I should do to keep my mom positive or comfortable even though things will get tougher? Also is there anything I should be aware of or know since she is now declining?  And last but not least is there anything I legally need to have besides the power of attorney? Thanks in advance.",2019-06-28 12:17:47

He only suffered for a few hours but he was never left alone. He wasn’t responsive but we knew he could hear us. He talked to him a lot and reminded him of how much we love him and that we will be ok. 

They took his body at around 3am. I miss him and sometimes forget he isn’t with us and then i remember. I feel I’m one of the most affected bc I really tried to do everything to save him. He had me make some decisions for him. Now we have to plan the viewing and service. He wants to be cremated. I feel angry at cancer, it’s so selfish. I know it died along with my dad. I wish it wasn’t necessary for my dad to pass away in order for the cancer to disappear. 

I want to say so much more but I just feel like crying but I’m surrounded by people and we are all coping differently. They are able to laugh more and joke around. I can do it for a short period of time. But I remember.

She started taking immunotherapy shortly therafter.. Recently(july 5th) she was admitted after a mass was found un her cerebellum, but was deemed treatable, and went through 5 sessions of focused radiation, which appears to have been oretty successful. Shortly after that,  she had a bowel obstruction which required surgery. My wife has been on dexamethasone for almost 3 months.  We recently added yervoy to the opdivo she was taking in hopes that it will get to the tumor in her braib, in case the radiation didnt destroy it all.. 
Well, that is the background. I am posting because this has been one of the most difficult days I have had. I was looking at our old photos, and i started to think about how life was before the diagnosis. I have been umpleasant to my family(quiet and grumpy), but i am just angry. Angry at the disease. Angry we did not catch it sooner. Angry i didnt do more.  Angry that she keeps having more problems stacked upon her already thick list of issues.

A year later, cervical cancer was stage 0, colon cancer gone... poofed...miracled. A few years later, cervical cancer was progressing, so surgery for that. Another few years later, melanoma again. Second time. Then 5 years ago, breast cancer again, stage 2. Double mastectomy, chemo, radiation then hormone treatment. Three TIAs stopped that after three weeks, so more surgery to remove the last of her lady parts. Then reconstruction, twice. Less than 2 years ago, it's back, stage 4. Did treatments for a year, still spreading. Had to take a break because of side effects almost killing her. Got on a clinical trial but had to drop before starting due to pain from cancer spreading to her spine and neck. Radiation to decrease pain for a bit. Went on hospice for a few weeks, found the strength to fight again. Found another trial that looked very promising, targeted a specific protein. After 1 cycle she didn't feel worse, but didn't feel better.  Ok, maybe we'll just get a little more time. Doc visit at start if second cycle, had to go to ER due to facial numbness. That's 3 weeks ago. Found out the cancer was in her brain. So she literally had cancer head to toe...bone mets, liver mets, lung mets, lymph nodes...everywhere. Doc stopped the trial, back on hospice. Yesterday morning she transitioned to her next journey, peacefully and pain free, with out oldest daughter, youngest granddaughter, and me holding her.

Soon as I touched down back in AUS a week later I asked, and that's when they told me. My dad had actually found out weeks prior but they didn't want to ruin mine and my fiance's trip. 

Fast forward 6 months, and he has managed to beat the bladder cancer,. Ur w strange growth has appeared I his leg. Within 2 weeks this growh is not over 8"" in eize. The doctors then tell us that his cancer from the bladder has spread and is metasratic. This absolutely crushes our family, as we had high hopes of my dad over coming this.

In good health, worked out everyday, was very lean and I was happy that he would help me get healthy too.  Well, first years were great.  He ended up having swelling in the side of his neck.  We went to the ER and they did a scan to find he had throat cancer.  He goes through all the radiation and chemo and late last year was diagnosed as cancer free.  OH MY GOD, all the hard work paid off.  He goes a couple of months having scans every couple of months to make sure everything is good.  They schedule him to have his port removed from the chemo and looking to remove his trach and stomach tubes.  Last week, his stomach started swelling.  I decided to convince him to go to the ER and have them look at it.  They drained the fluid and looked at a bump on his side and started to run test.  Now they come back with he has cancer in his spine/hip, lungs, and possible the liver.  WTF!  As a care giver to both of these people spanning over 15 years I just can't take this cancer shit anymore.  I mean I am personally not even 50 yet.  Sometimes I feel like the black widow and somehow I'm cursed and I'm causing this on everyone else.  I don't know what to do today.  I'm totally upset and depressed today to the point that I just want to run away and stop dealing with the stress.  I'm the primary person who works and supports the household.  I've earned two degrees in the middle of all this to somehow make more money to take care of myself and the household.  I just feel like I can't win.  I'm basically wondering if people out there feel this way too.",2017-05-22 22:55:23
Questions for young (ex) partners of cancer patients,8,jhu40c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/jhu40c/questions_for_young_ex_partners_of_cancer_patients/,12,1603664563.0,"Hey there.

I am looking for some answers. I am going through cancer treatment for the second time in 2 years and it has been tough. My partner is struggling with it really hard. Therefore i have some questions for caregivers.

- did you ever think about leaving your ill partner because it all got too much?

- did you struggle with the chance of not being able to reach your own life goals and if yes, how did you cope with this?

- what did your partner do to make it less difficult for you?

- how old are/were you?

A little backstory: we have been together for almost 7 years now and i got cancer 2 years ago. I recovered pretty well and my partner could cope because he thought it was over. But it came back a few months ago. He is in his mid 20's and just starting a demanding career while doing his masters. It is pretty tough but it is his one and only dream. He doesn't feel ready to take on such a big responsibility as taking care of a sick partner now his life is not yet stable enough. He feels like He has to choose between his own life, or caring for me. The reality is not so black and white but that's how he feels. And he makes me feel guilty every day for holding him back from pursuing his ambitions. He tells me that if this happened 10 years later it would have been much easier to be there for me.

I really wonder if someone went through something like him and how do people handle this. I don't know whether to stay with him or to break up with him because i seem to be ruining his future.

I Can't Believe It's Happening Again,8,io23ba,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/io23ba/i_cant_believe_its_happening_again/,4,1599487313.0,"Sorry for the novel. Got no one else to tell. 
Welp. Here I am. My first husband who I met in 2002, we got married three years later because we were in love. He started having health problems in 2009. 

It got so bad for him that he could barely walk. He was in constant pain. He had to do his marine mechanic business from the couch with people that he got to work for him. 

We applied for disability for him but they just kept dragging their feet, even after we got a lawyer.

We didn't know what was wrong. He had blue cross insurance so he was always at the doctors. Pain pills they prescribed barely masked his pain. I had to take care of him because he was essentially bedridden.

One time i took him to his drs appointment, i had to use a wheelchair to get him there. The Dr, an older man, made my husband wait an hour past his appointment while he was writhing in agony. When the dr came in he said ""Im sorry Mr Harris but there is nothing I can do for you.""

Fast forward to us losing our home because of all this. We ended up living in his brother's motorhome far outside of town. Then one day he told me to call an ambulance. I did, and the next day when I went to see him I got the news that my husband had stage 4 lung cancer. He was put in hospice after two days. By then it had gotten to his brain. He was gone 3 days after his diagnosis. 

I was heartbroken. My husband gone at age 54. No working vehicle, no money but the 700$ left in his bank.. And a 24 mile walk (12 each way) to the nearest store. When i ran out of food I started out at 7am and got home almost at 9 at night. 

I was able to leave that place after a few months thanks to a loan I got from a friend who helped me get a place in the city. Even then things weren't easy. I eventually lost the place and couch surfed. 

I ended up waiting for three years to get his disability backpay which sucked because during that time I was homeless.

In 2014 I had a better job and a place to live, and a new love interest. He was 24 years older than me - but we still had much in common. We enjoyed each others company.

And boy he loved to drink. So much so that his week long benders became unbearable. 

I moved out for 8 months so he could get his life together. During that time, he got his last DUI. I agreed to come stay with him if he put my name on a cheap vehicle, and I would drive him wherever he needed. So he sobered up, and was better for a time. I decided to give him a chance. We got married in 2018, and got a newish car that I just love. 

Things seemed great until December of last year. He slipped into old habits and began drinking until he was in a stupor. I learned to stop trying to fight him and just leave the house when he got like that. Except it got serious, things just weren't ""normal"" and I called an ambulance for him. 
 

I had to call them again a month later, and this time I told the nurses not to release him despite what he said or did. They let him go anyway, and somehow he stumbled home. I found him at the neighbors, having a beer. 

The third time I called an ambulance for him they gave him tests for his liver..and they found a large mass. Finally! Some help. He got it checked and he was diagnosed with primary liver cancer in february, a week after our anniversary. 

Its not looking good for him. Hes 66yo. He was cured of hep c many years ago but drinking really weakened his liver. Hes not taking to treatment very well. Its not growing but its not shrinking either. 

So i just can't believe Im going through this again. Im making sure he talks with his family often. Im angry that he wont get to see his granddaughters grow up. And i try to keep him updated on appointments. But its like being with someone who's not all there..with all the meds he's on. It's not looking good. 

At least my husband now has made sure that I won't be broke and homeless after he's gone. He wanted to make sure of that for a long time even before his cancer.

What a punch in the gut. Two marriages, stolen by cancer. 

Thanks for reading my story. Sometimes I just want to cry but that wont help a bit. Someone has to be strong.",2020-09-07 14:01:53
THIS IS IT,9,icbew6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/icbew6/this_is_it/,2,1597819021.0,"Hello good people of reddit! 
I think we can all agree cancer is a vile disease that has taken the lives of too many lovely people out there...
My name is Hailee and I’m a cancer survivor. March 16, 2021 will mark one decade of remission for me, and I thank the stars every day. 
I’ve come here on recommendation of my boyfriend to tell you a bit about my story...
I was 14 when I was diagnosed with aggressive osteogenic sarcoma, and my life was flipped on its head.
Going through the hardest year of my life, I made a lot of deep realizations about myself and the Illness. I had started writing prose pieces that gave people some insight into my life as a teenage cancer patient, and little tricks I used to get by.
A few years after completing chemotherapy, my mother and I decided to combine our minds to bring a book to you, that we hope can touch the lives of someone in need of it.
You’ll find chapters from both patient and caretaker perspectives, with tips at the end of each segment. Tips for patients, caretakers, and friendly people who aren’t sure how to lend a hand.
I felt weird about making this post initially because I didn’t want it to seem like a huge “look at me” ordeal... I just kind of wish I had something like this when I was going through it . The only reason we made the book was to hopefully help a family who needs it like ours did, and if I don’t tell people it’s out there no one will know.
If you are interested in reading more about our story and how we tried to make the impossible possible every day, follow us on social media, or grab a copy for you or someone you care about! 
Thank you for you time and much love!

Is it possible to have good times, or let yourself enjoy time away whilst knowing that person doesn't need you there right then? I honestly cant imagine it, but I'm still in shock.

We’re seeing my husband’s oncologist after his latest CT came back. His osteosarcoma has spread. 

He’s 29, and was first diagnosed with osteosarcoma in his right hip in 2013. 

As of late, he’s had a lot of pain all over his body for a few months now. CT came back recently and showed several smaller spots in 5 different places in his upper body and a larger spot in his other hip. 

We’re trying to feel positive and feel like we caught this at a good point all these years later, just nervous and he’s in a lot of pain. The meds are helping but we’re just anxious about tomorrow. 

Feels good to share. I hate talking about this with anyone but it helps. 

We’re about to move back to our hometown and I’m trying to find another job that’s not as long hours as mine is now, so it’s just a crazy time. 

I guess I’m just trying to get this off my chest and look for any advice or encouragement. 

Obviously our fear is that there’s nothing more they can do, but I don’t think that will be the case. We’re very spiritual people and pray and are very hopeful. 
I’m just stressed and scared.

I guess I’m transitioning into a caregiver position?

He can't eat.
Can barely walk.
Is very conscious but very ill, like nauseous all the time.
What could have happened? Is cancer winning? He is getting uppsettingly skinny. And although I am a strong woman I have problems when I have to look him in the eye and assure him everything's gonna be alright right after vomiting.

Did indulging in his favorite foods might have had something to do? I feel like the worst caregiver ever.",2019-02-15 07:04:45
Experiment to help my mental health....,9,aggoc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/aggoc0/experiment_to_help_my_mental_health/,2,1547636017.0,"I keep feeling like I'm trying to spin WAY too many plates and they are all crashing around me all the time, so I'm trying something new today. I'm writing what I get done each day on the dry erase board that I pass many time each day. Even if it's something small like taking a shower (which I don't always get to as it's not a high priority point of my day) or feeding the dogs. It might even make me more aware of taking care of myself more too (let's face it, we tend to make ourselves a low priority more often than not when they need a lot of care). 

&#x200B;

My hopes are that it will make me register what I do (and what is not just caretaking) and that I'm accomplishing (and not failing) on a regular day. Some days won't be that much other than what I do for Mom, but I'm trying not to let my own life (my own self-care, husband, pets, house, friends, hobbies) completely crash as she gets priority 95% of the time - everybody has been amazing and understanding, but our lives are completely different than they were before all of this and lots of things are just having to slide. 

&#x200B;

Basically, the only times I can leave the house any more is when we leave for one of her appointments, so I'm finding myself falling down a rabbit hole of a void which I'm trying to dodge like the plague. I can't control that much of my own life right now as she needs a ton of care and can't be alone at all anymore, so I'm trying to make the best of what I CAN control in my life. 

&#x200B;

On a better note, I'm getting a lot of small projects done around the house that don't take a lot of time all at once (she rings for assistance often as she can't do much for herself anymore). I'm also incredibly thankful for my husband as he works nights so he can take the night shift when he gets home so I can get some sleep, and I pick back up in the AM when he needs to go to bed. Unfortunately, we're both passing shifts (with him working full time as well) so we don't get as much sleep as we probably really need and are both running on fumes most of the time these days - this is also not helping my headspace, so I'm trying to get cat naps when I can as well (the caretaking is also a lot physically). Take what you can get, right? We're also trying to make a point to take time together on the weekends to watch a movie or show (and we take turns when she rings for assistance during that time) so we have some us time. Thankfully we are in the age of Netflix and streaming so we can pause whenever we need to hop back into caretaker mode.  


What are you guys doing to keep yourself going and in a better headspace when you can't really take time off for yourself? ",2019-01-16 10:53:37

I love and support her 100%. I am by her side when I am not working. Lately i've been dealing with depression and feeling alone. I have made an appointment to speak with a mental health therapist; I recognize that is severely needed. My current struggle is feeling stuck in ""Caregiver Mode"". Daily conversations with my wife are mostly about pain, discomfort, anxiety, sadness, fear and anger. I am very cognizant of how I have no idea of what she's feeling or going through. I purposely shift the focus to more positive aspects of life in an attempt keep us from going into a downward mood. After 2 1/2 years, I am finding myself in my own downward spiral. Feeling lonely but not alone, I am married and in love with my wife. Intimacy is sporadic when she feels guilty. I struggle to mentally bypass seeing her as a cancer patient. When we are successful the guilt is overwhelming watching her hold back the pain despite lubrication. All of this has resulted in my becoming more withdrawn and she's noticing. I feel as if I suffering in silence then remind myself; mine is nothing compared to hers. Guilt for feeling this way manifests followed by anger for being selfish. Crying alone happens next, then fighting with myself to stop. Telling myself this not my time to break down. I then find the strength to become engaged and actively love and support my wife.

I know it is hard for everyone of any age but I was 23 (now 26) when my mom was diagnosed. It has been a journey full of a lot of ups and downs and down downs. Dealing with my mom's diagnoses has been extremely difficult for me and I have had to overcome a lot because of it. Since the diagnosis, I have felt completely apart from my peer who are not dealing with something like this. 

I have searched and searched for support groups aimed for young adults with parents who have cancer, I have not been successful. There's a a lot of support out there but none that is targeted at my age group. It's a challenge because we are not in high school where a lot of support groups are but yet we are not really old enough where aging and ill parents is a commonality among our peers. It a tough time, trying to grow into a real adult at this age and I am curious about the experiences of others. 

**Because of this I am writing a book so that people like us can feel a little less alone. Stories about those of us in our 20somethings dealing with a parent with cancer. If you have a story to share I would really appreciate hearing from you. If you have journals or writings you would like to share that would also be much appreciated.**

Caring for my young wife,9,62ynpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/62ynpa/caring_for_my_young_wife/,4,1491151210.0,"Hello everyone. I was turned to this sub from a kind redditor who spoke very highly of your support, and reading through the posts it seems like a wonderful and safe place to unburden oneself of all the pain and confusion that is borne from the situations we find ourselves in. I thank you in advance for your time in reading through our story.

Last year, my fiancee was diagnosed with stage 3 triple-negative breast cancer at the age of 28. We went through the whole treatment plan (chemotherapy, single side mastectomy, and radiation), and our scan last October showed no signs of the disease and were told she was cured. Of course we were absolutely ecstatic, feeling secure enough to make plans for our future without fear. But our time of peace only lasted a mere 4 months. She had a seizure in late January of this year, and this led us to finding out that the cancer had metastasized to her brain, adrenal gland, and both lungs. We were terrified, but at least it's treatable and we would have some time together still, albeit absurdly short (the doctor estimated about 5 years).

So we started chemotherapy (ixabepilone) and were hoping that everything was going well. But in late February she started complaining of severe discomfort in her back (consistently rating her pain level at a 7 or 8) so we made a visit to the emergency room, which ended up with us being admitted for 5 days: the chemotherapy wasn't working. In that time we learned that her cancer had spread to her kidneys and adrenal gland, liver, and pancreas. She also had another seizure which led us to finding six small tumors in her brain.

We recently finished going through whole brain radiation treatment and have started another type of chemo (Eribulin) this last Friday (and immunotherapy once she's completely off steroids).

She's my best friend and soul mate. We've been together for 3 and a half years and engaged for 3. Before being sent home by the palliative care team (which did get her pain under control with long acting morphine) we decided to get married, officiated by the hospital chaplain.

I'm thankful that we still have treatment options, but I am so so so worried that this next chemo won't work. The oncologist had told us that due to the aggressiveness of her cancer we can expect a year if this new treatment works: if it doesn't, we horrifically expect to have only another 6 months together.

I'm losing her so fast. How the fuck am I supposed to say goodbye to my best friend? She is a glass half full type, and has hope that this treatment will work and that an immunotherapy we're scheduled for (PD-1 inhibitor) will yield good results. But either way, a year will not be enough. No amount of time will ever be enough.

And it's so hard to enjoy the time we do have together with this spectre looming above us. We are realistic and open with each other, so our days are filled with as much laughter and joy as we can fit between the intermittent bouts of sobbing in each other's arms, lamenting the notion that she very well may not make it to her thirties, and that I will undoubtedly be a very young widower.

I am so not ready to say goodbye to the love of my life, and I know I never will be. She is so goddamn young, all the plans we had for our lives have been crushed within just a few months.

This is the most horrific and absurd way I can imagine to learn how unfair life really is. I'm not just terrified of losing her one day: I'm terrorized with the thought that I will have to watch my beautiful wife endure more and more pain and suffering as the months tick by.

I don't know how to do this.",2017-04-02 16:40:10

My Mom and I have been taking turns driving Dad up to Penn every single weekday for cancer treatment. On the days that I go, Dad and I have a routine. I wheel him to the cancer center, we check-in, and then I go get both of us coffees and muffins from Starbucks while he waits to be seen. He always gets a warm blueberry muffin and an Americano. I usually return - snacks in hand - before he even leaves the waiting room. Well... the woman in front of me at Starbucks today bought the last blueberry muffin. The cashier checked the back. Checked the front. Muffinless. 

""My Dad's in treatment for cancer and this muffin is the one thing he looks forward to about coming up here"" I stammer over the giant lump in my throat. Tears begin to roll down my face. I'm turning beet red. I'm losing control. I'm overwhelmed. I'm angry. I'm sad. My emotions are bubbling over. The cashier apologizes profusely, obviously uncomfortable about my impending emotional outburst. I settle for a blueberry scone, give her my money, and immediately scramble to the corner of the room where I hide my face and wipe my tears... embarrassed. 

I feel a hand on my shoulder. I look up to find a middle aged black woman in business attire staring down at me. ""I just wanna give you a hug."" she says. I melt into her embrace as she soothes me saying ""I know honey, it's hard. I lost my father to cancer last year. It's okay to cry. It's okay to feel. You'll be okay. There are just some things that you can't control. Even muffins."" We part with a smile. I thank her for her kind words. She leaves with a friend, coffee in hand. 

I clean up my face. I grab our order from the barista. I go back down to the cancer center. Dad is gone, having been called for his treatment. Minutes later he's wheeled out to the waiting area by a member of the staff. I plaster a smile on my face, holding out the Starbucks goodies. We go the car. He eats his scone and never mentions the missing muffin. I don't mention my experience either. 

Huge amounts of gratitude to that business woman. I'll never know your name but I won't forget your kindness. Life is hard. We're harder. Rage on.",2016-12-07 13:43:08

He has severe inattentive type ADHD and anxiety. He is doing really well with school so far. 

My ex mother-in-law called me today and said she was just diagnosed with small cell lung cancer. She lives alone and needs someone to stay with her 24/7 while she goes through chemo and radiation, which could take 2 months. She wants my son to stay with her and take her temp multiple times a day, microwave meals, take out the trash, and just be there in case she falls.

My first reaction was that I didn’t think it was right or fair to ask that of a child. I understand and sympathize that she’s scared, but I don’t think she realizes what she’s asking of my son. She’s making it sound like a simple task, but I know it can’t be. 

My son has difficulty taking care of himself due to his ADHD. I have to remind him to brush his teeth, bathe, eat lunch and drink enough fluids on school days because his medication affects his appetite. His elearning consists of live Google Meet classes where he’s shut in his bedroom from 8am - 1pm everyday. He won’t be able to concentrate if he has to worry about her. He may be so engrossed in what he’s doing that he won’t hear her if something happens.

She said she spoke to my ex about it and he believes my son is fully capable of handling it and that it’s really up to my son if he wants to do it or not. I was like ummm no but okay. 

I asked my husband what he thought and he wasn’t sure. He said he needed to learn about the real world at some point and about being responsible. Obviously nobody around me has dealt with a cancer patient before.

I did some reading and it seems like a stressful, full-time job. Not to mention the risk of exposure to the treatment drugs by the caregiver if they have to clean up bodily fluids within the first 2 days. A teenage boy with ADHD isn’t exactly careful. 

Is everyone around me being completely naive or am I being overprotective? I think he should be concentrating on school and being a kid. I think she’s underestimating just how sick she’s going to be. He’s going to have a hard enough time knowing his grandma has cancer. He’s never dealt with death before.",2020-08-30 16:33:59

While his doctors, therapists, etc., are helping me, they are talking about Quality rather than Quantity at this point, which I know is what we are looking at, truthfully.

In early July, my mother was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer in a pretty advanced stage (effected lymph nodes in distant regions like neck and lower stomach region). From never having any previous symptoms or serious health issues outside of a blood clot, she’s now being told that her anticipated life expectancy is around the 10 month mark. Our 2nd opinion oncologist that we visited today has said that her type of cancer has a best-case scenario survival rate of 2.5 to 3 years. 

My question to you, the experienced, is how do you organise your life around it? I’m 22, the middle child & we have a very close mother-daughter bond. I’ve taken every required day off work to get her to all of her appointments and to be with her throughout all medical developments. But, with the most consistent message being that she may die soon, I’m worried that a few days off here and there will not be enough.

I work full time in an admin job that is definitely not my end goal; I got it fresh out of uni so that I could be paid whilst looking for degree-relative work. My boss has been super understanding & flexible with me, but now I’m genuinely contemplating leaving.

For this, I defer to you guys. I’m very new to the process of living with cancer so close in my family, and it’s been such an emotionally blinding roller coaster.

Today he told me he hasn’t given up yet but he feels like he will die anyway, that it is very likely because of the numbers and his complex karyotype.

I am new to reddit, so I am exploring different groups and trying to figure this out. A few weeks ago my husband was diagnosed with seminoma testicular cancer, the doctor said he’s a stage 2. He just had his port put in today and will start chemo on June 15th. His Treatment plan is a three week cycle repeated three times. The first week is 5 days a week 5-6 hours a day and then the next two weeks 1 day a week and then repeated. Here for any advice! Thank you.",2020-06-05 09:04:15

Have you found any technology or other tools to help make this time easier?

I know for us that my husband finished treatment at the end of November and is supposed to have his 6-month scans in a couple weeks but he has a virtual consult to discuss them, so they're likely getting pushed back. Some concern with this since he feels his symptoms have been worse the last month or so and he's been running on-and-off low-grade fevers for a couple of weeks too, which has happened in the past during times of disease growth.",2020-05-07 07:34:25

I’m Brandon, a 17 year old lad, in late September, my grandad got diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and given only around 6 months to live. He lives on his own so I visit him everyday to help do daily tasks, shopping, clean, help with medication etc, and others visit maybe once a week or at a weekend to help sort paperwork and appointments out. 

I am writing this on here because he has gone downhill in the last few weeks , meaning the final stages are approaching faster than expected.

This may sound strange but I haven’t showed much emotion, I feel like this is because I am constantly thinking of things I could help him with next. The way I have not showed emotions have really concerned me and I feel once he does pass, I will go off the rails. 

What I am trying to ask, is what happens after? 

I only see my friends once a month, if that and I am really scared that I won’t feel a connection with them.

5yo Nephew - Brain Cancer,7,ezmcrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/ezmcrg/5yo_nephew_brain_cancer/,5,1580989979.0,"My nephew (my sister’s child) was diagnosed with brain cancer three years ago in April, when he was 2.5. It’s been a really long and nightmareish road which, I’m sure anyone in this group would understand. He has been on multiple types of treatment, including a clinical trial. Currently, his tumor is “stable” (and the tumor isn’t just one mass - it’s like spaghetti, all through his brain and spine) but he has seizures multiple times a day and is impacted by them (or by the tumor or by the drugs, it’s unclear) cognitively and has severe ataxia which makes it really difficult for him to walk and impacts his fine motor control. Also, he’s an amazing kid with a wonderful sense of humor and is so, so sweet. Also the cutest kid ever. I love him so much. 

One of the things that has been difficult about this experience is processing my role in all of this. I’m the aunt, not the parent. I moved closer after he was diagnosed to be able to help. I’ve babysat every time they’ve asked and routinely offer. When he’s in the hospital, I’m usually there to take at least a quarter of the duties/shifts etc along with his parents. I would never say that my experience is the same as theirs - it isn’t. They live this nightmare every minute of every day. They are impacted financially and I am not. But I’m still a person and this has been the backdrop of my life for three years and it’s been horrible. But there’s no support for me. I’ve looked for support groups but there’s legitimately nothing that applies to me and is relevant enough to be helpful. I’m in therapy, which is wonderful, but my therapist doesn’t specialize in anticipatory grief or kids with terminal illness.  She hasn’t been through this. 

My nephew is the only child in our family. I’m 39 and single. My mom died five months before my nephew was diagnosed  

This has all been horrible for a long time, but I’m writing this because I’m struggling so much with my relationship with my sister as my nephew’s health declines. I’ve always experienced my sister as acting in ways that are hurtful to me.  She doesn’t have good skills to process things - she generally lashes out, especially at me. She says means things to me about my appearance, my relationship status, etc and if I protest, she acts very innocent and sort of turns things around on me, again making me the one with the problem. There have been years at a time where I wasn’t in touch with her at all for these reasons. When my nephew got sick, I decided to do what I had to do to maintain a relationship with him and to be a good aunt. At times my sister and I seemed to be a little closer, but as his health has declined (he was just released from the ICU after having almost catastrophic seizures) she’s seeming to want to distance herself and him from me - not taking me up on offers to come and visit or help at the hospital this week. Given that in the past I’ve been right in the thick of it with them in the hospital, that’s a radical change. 

I just got back from visiting them at home and it was heartbreaking- he’s not himself and she obviously (body language, tone of voice, etc) didn’t want me there. She’s grieving and has no support - refuses therapy, support groups, etc. Obviously she’s going to be at her worst which will mean she has no capacity to treat me with respect. But what do I do with my grief then? What happens if he dies and I haven’t seen him often because I don’t feel welcome and maybe I’ve faded from his memory? How am I going to live with this for the rest of my life?  

Thanks for listening.",2020-02-06 11:52:59

I made her tell me the exact pain level for each hour.  Last night my mother was on the floor for an hour rubbing her legs and I thought this has to stop.  If she refuses to request more pain meds then she can suffer without my elderly mom layinngon the floor rubbing her legs.  Then when the new nurse came she was finally able to get the point across to her that purposely avoiding answering questions about her pain levels was not productive.  The nurse made it clear there really is no limit to receiving the pain meds she needs at this point.  This is in home hospice.  Most people at her stage are drooling on themselves.  She even pointed out that she barely seemed on any medication at all.  Apparently my sister may have been concerned with becoming addicted.  I felt like saying, you're dying in three months, who gives a fuck.  You could be shooting heroin for all it matters!  Seriously!  She's been a shut in her whole life and has Dependant Personality Disorder (undiagnosed).  She has never stood up for herself or spoken up.  Why suffer and cause your family suffering for the remaining time you are here by moaning and being in pain when there are pain meds available?  I think she's finally starting to get it.  I myself have attempted suicide so many time and would never turn down a medication that could end my horrible suffering.  Especially whne my own suicide was around the bend every second of it.  I can only do so much, nor my elderly mother to manage her pain.  She has to learn how to depend on the professionals and medication to ease her pain.",2019-09-26 04:15:57
Do you want to help to make NHS wait times shorter?

At a routine scan a mark was found on his liver, which turned out to be cancerous. For the next two years we fought hard to keep him around, never losing hope. Since OM is a rare cancer we had to search for treatment options and travel around the country to search out information. He endured failed surgery, medical trials, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The care he received from NHS staff was almost always excellent, but we noticed that when he was taking part in a trial (Which was privately paid for by the drug companies) he received scan and test results much more quickly. It occurred to me that most people who have cancer wait weeks, or occasionally more than a month, for results from tests or scans which tell them whether and how their disease is progressing.  I reached out to many other cancer sufferers and my fears were confirmed. This wait was always so hard for us and although my Dad was the most positive person I've ever met, it even got to him sometimes, especially in the last weeks of his life when we knew time was running out and decisions were more urgent. Unfortunately, my Dad died in June 2018 never having had his last go at chemotherapy because the results from his tests came too late. It may have made a difference, it may not, but it would have been nice to have been able to try. In my Dad's memory and with the support of cancer charity OcuMel I have created a petition urging the government to consider the time it takes for cancer patients to receive scan or test results. It seems like the only thing on the agenda at the moment is Brexit, but people are still living and suffering through 'normal' life. There are things which need addressing and this is one of them. If you are frustrated, or worried about the time it takes cancer patients to get results, please consider signing my petition. Thank you.

If doctors give up should we do the same?,7,c9zt5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/c9zt5d/if_doctors_give_up_should_we_do_the_same/,1,1562482326.0,"Every time they gave us hope, they took it away. I thought that that was the worst thing to ever happen to me. I was told my mother was cancer free and she went to Egypt to visit her family. When she came back they said it spreak but the medicine was helping and stopping it from spreading. After a week or 2 they said that the medicine didn't do anything and that it was helping. Her lungs started to fill with fluids and they told us that they'd give her chemo pills and that it would probably stop the fluid. It didn't. They than said that they could give her a drain so she didn't have to go to the hospital every 2 weeks and stay there for a week every time. And than they said that they wouldn't do that and that they didn't have a solution. Her chemo pills are their last attempt, because she already did every thing else
Chemo, surgery, lazer, pills, chemo pills and all that shit. 

She kind of gave up on herself. She doesn't want to leave the house and the only time.she leaves the house is to go to the hospital. I want to get her a wheelchair cause she no longer has the strength to walk a lot and I want her to leave the house with me so she can enjoy life and not get depressed. She refuses the weelchair cause she's to pride. She says that she would wait for my brother or my father to take her places with their car. They won't. I tried everything to convince them but they don't care enough and don't see the need for her to leave the house.  I don't have my license yet, so I can't take her and she isn't able to walk enough without it hurting and without her being exhausted. 

I know that the doctors see her as a lost case, cause they said that the chemo pills were there last attempt and that
 They can't do anything else. I know that my mother gave up for the most part and is just waiting for it to happen and that kills me. 

I think that My father is in denial that she even has cancer. My brothers suck as human beings and they don't seem to care based on their attempts to help her. My littoe brother never calls her or visits when she's at the hospital.

It seems like everyone kind of gave up. Should I give up? Am I an ass for concidering it. Every time I go to school, internship, work or to get her anything I feel like I can't breathe till I come back and see that she's still alive. Every time my phone rings or buzzes I feel like that's it. Every time I go to sleep I wonder if she's going to wake up. I had a couple of shocks when she randomly fell asleep during our conversation and I thought that that was the end. I try to not shake her up, and I don't want her to worry when that happens so I just feeze and listen to see if she moves or breathes. I feel like I'm stressed out 24/7. 

I feel bad when I leave her for school/work/groceries or doctor appointments, because I'm the only one who really takes care of her. I don't know if anyone would notice it of she didn't breathe any more. They'd think she's sleeping, but what if she isn't sleeping? I think that I'm going crazy. Today at work I kept hearing a phone buzzing and ringing and I kept rushing to my phone, but  no one was calling. I've gotten several panick attacks thinking that it was over and my mother already said that if her heart were to stop, she didn't want to be saved. I can't really sleep anymore. Not when I'm not by her side which I can only be at the hospital otherwise by dad's with her. 

I think the worst part is thar I can't hold her. I can't hug her without causing her more pain. I can't touch her. And I can't talk to her. It's like the stronger her cancer is the more it takes over her. It changes her. Sometimes I feel that the woman she is not my mother, but she still is. 

I tried to open up to her and to my friends about it. My friend said that I make it to much about me. That I use her cancer to make people feel bad about me. And my mother doesn't believe that we (my father, brothers and I really suffer because we're not the ones having cancer). She feels like we should continue to live our lifes like she doesn't have it. But she has cancer. And it doesn't matter what I'm doing I can never let that go. 

I no longer know. Should I give up? I feel like someone locked me in a room and told me that there's a bomb that's going to go off, but the person didn't tell me when. On the background I constantly heat it ticking and with every minute that passes I feel both happy that it didn't happen and nervous, scared, anxious and just terrified that it's going to happen soon. 
And I'm trying to get out! I want to get out, but it doesn't matter how hard I try ir how hard I cry the door won't open and I keep hearing it ticking. When I'm happy for something, the sound brings me back down. And every time someone gives up, a doctor tells me that they can't do anything the sound get's louder and I feel the walls just closing in on me. It's like metal walls apear and create a even smaller room that I get stuck in. 
That's the feeling. I feel stuck. And in my head I'm trying to convince myself that the person lied and that there is no bomb, but I hear it ticking. Every breathe could be her last. And she's the reason I'm here. And I know that I don't want to be here if she isn't here. 

I desperately want no need to hug her, to know that it's going to be okay. And I can't.  So I either keep slaming myself against the walls trying to break free or I need to accept what's coming. Give up. 

And I don't want to give up, but now it feels like me fighting and living in fear is going to reach a point where it's even worse than the pain of it ending. 
But I constantly remind her to keep fighting and to not give up. How could I tell her that if I already gave up. 

I want to ger my driver's license so I can take her wherever she wants to go. So I can help her escape reality. I also want to just quit every thing and stay by her side to not miss a second. I want to make her proud and get my degree and get a good job. I want to buy her a house that she has always dreamed off. I want her to enjoy life. To be with the people she loves. I want to show her the world and take her to everywhere. I want to teach her how to swim and take her to the beach. I want her to not be in pain. I want her to be at my wedding one day, cause she told me that that was her dream. I want her to hold my grandchildren one day and show her that I raised them well, because she raised me well. I want her to be with her entire family: with all her sisters and brothers and her mother. I want all the people that she loves to be there for her and show her all the love in the world, because that is what she deserves. 

I want her to not cry about my brother's lack of interest in her well being. I want her to not cry when he goes weeks without even saying a word to her, even though he lives with her. I want my dad to stop being ignorant about her being sick. I want him to take it seriously so he stops looking at me like I'm insane for worrying and wanting her to live. I want him to realize that his wife is no longer able to take care of him cause she's no longer able to take care of herself. 

When the sun goes down, reality sets in. I can't give her everything that I want to give her. I can't give her what she deserves. My father and brothers will only realize what she meant to them when she's gone. Right now they look at me to do all she did for them: cook, clean and just take care of them. But I'm tired of taking care of everybody's needs. 

I'm just searching for a small appartment now, cause she's all I got in this world and I can't stand the idea of being near them when she's not here. I hope that I could take her there so she's out of this house, filled with careless and selfish individuals, empty conversations and fake sincerity. 

I gave up on them. I need to not give up on her.",2019-07-07 06:52:06

2 months later he goes back to the military doctor (different one) starting to have chess pain and his diet is now liquid and wanted to know about the scope. Did testing for his heart found out that they didn't file the scope paperwork correctly.  

Month later goes back to the new military doctor that is now stationed there. Looks at everything looks at David, puts a rush on a scope. August was the quickest date.

End of August we go out of town to get the scope done. Find tumors, they take a biopsy not even a week later we get a call. We go back to the doctor that helped him gave us the bad news. Gives us so much information, and more ensures so he can keep up with his weight.

We get a call that day to go out of town to another hospital to do exploratory surgery. We find out it's stage 4. Few days later David gets a feeding tube. 2 weeks go by under observation, what was supposed to be a 3 day treatment turned out to be longer. 

The make arrangements for him to go at the cross cancer center with all the supplies. After all the seminars and informations he gets a port, and informations for a clinical trial.

This point we were planning a wedding before all this happened.  Between paper work , doctors appointments and work. We know that he have gasteric esophageal cancer stage 4. I tell my work I need to be on stress leave because I need to take care of David. Not to mention September and October was a blur. We do a quick small cerimony to get married.  

With all the medications chemotherapy and immunotherapy booster at first it was helping him. But few month in his liver tumor grew . They took him off the clinical trail and set him up with something geared toward his type of cancer. 

This therapy had a lot less side effects, and we are now waiting for my husband to get his ct scan at the end of the month. But right now he has been getting major back pains and the hospital here is trying their best to help him. I had to call the ambulance this morning because he could not sit up without breathing. 


Ps sorry this is so long..

Update may 6, we get a rush ct scan an hour away from this hospital to another.  We find out what is causing his back pain. His tumor grew and it's pressing on the c6 vertebra causing friction and pressure.  So now tomorrow we are going to the cross cancer that is an hour for radiation.",2019-05-06 10:49:47

So Tired,9,b4yfv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/b4yfv5/so_tired/,1,1553474818.0,"I (F47) almost told my father (66) to f\* off and get out of my house today.  I need a break and my vacation with my sister on Friday to Cuba cannot come fast enough.  


My father was diagnosed with angiosarcoma Jan 2017 in his two cheeks and brow areas.  He is one of the rare of the rare with this cancer (which is rare in itself) as the majority of those who get it are other cancer survivors (radiation induced)...his just happened after a large garbage can hit him in the face and left a bruise.  


My father lives with me and for the most part we get along, I learned to ignore his constant negativity (i.e you can say ""look dad there's a blue jay on the veranda"" and his comment would be ""great, he'll probably shit every where"") over the years but it is getting so bad that I hate being around him and talking to him as it just brings me down.  


I am losing my empathy because of his attitude and constant negativity - I feel horrible in saying this but I with the cancer would just hurry up and end it because I am not sure how much longer I can live with him and it is only getting worse.  


He did chemo in 2017 - did really well with it but in June had some kind of heart or stroke issue and after one more month of chemo removed it from it.  They let his body heal until Dec 2017 when his face started up again and they put him on doxil (an infusion that lasts 3 weeks and then you go back and get another) but in a week he landed in the hospital with no white blood count for a week.  No more chemo for him.    


Radiation was started March 2018 until May 2018 - he almost made it through all planned rounds (22 of 25) of his cheeks but cut short the radiation around his eyes (9 of 15) as he couldn't take the eye pain anymore (his eyelids looked like crispy bacon).  It took him a good 6 months to heal from that.  

  
He has opted for no more treatment, and he goes to a palliative care doctor every 3-4 weeks and a nurse visits every other week.  His face is getting very angry and with it his moods.  He is on many pills (steroids, antibiotics, probiotics, metformin (started today), etc, etc and blew up at me just now when I brought the new med home about how many pills he is taking and what does he call this one and he has to take it two times a day and then proceeds to read off the side affects, getting angrier and angrier.  He goes on about the two times a day WITH food and I couldn't bite my tongue and said, well...you do eat twice a day so I'm not seeing a problem.  I had to walk away because I was about to blow up at him.  Not just because of that, but 5min before I had walked into the house after grocery shopping and no sooner than I closed the door he was complaining about my robot vacuum (""tired of hearing it so I just picked it up and put it back to its home and it better not decide to continue!"") and then I got ""my face found a new place to leak"" and he shows me the bridge of his nose and ""how the hell am I suppose to sleep now?"" and he continued on that ramp...then the metformin...  
It has been non-stop for a good two weeks now.  Thursday as I left for work in the morning just as I closed the door he yelled out ""I'm going to talk to the doctor tomorrow about assisted suicide"" and then that was on my brain all day.  And of course he didn't (I went to his appointment with him) and he was jovial and nice (the doctor calls him an excuse for an excuse right to his face as my father has excuses for everything of why he cannot do what the doctor asks him to do).  


I really wish my Grandma was alive (his mom) as he's always been like this and she always helped me with his moods.  But now it just me (all siblings live over an hour away) and it is getting worse every.single.day.  He doesn't want treatment, so it is just going to get worse.  His decision!  I have all these horrible thoughts in my head, I just want it over, please don't let this go on and on.  I want my life back.

And he is coming up on 3yrs of cancer treatments. I have always felt strongly that he would be able to pull through, and things seemed almost manageable for a while, but he recently confessed that he has lost all hope. Not only that, but he hasn't felt any hope since before Christmas. I'm devastated by this. I know how critical someone's mindset can be to their recovery, and even though there has been no change in prognosis (which is not good but ever changing) suddenly I feel like I've already lost him, and like my entire world just shattered. I flat out don't want to live in a world he's not in, and I am having a really, really hard time trying handle this news. Since he told me, tears just keep rolling down my cheeks; not really crying, but more like all my fear and grief and desparation are all just overflowing out of my eyes.

I'm trying to be careful, as I don't want him feeling burdened by how I'm feeling about this right now, but I suddenly feel like there is no reason to carry on. 

This isn't a suicide message. I don't want to live, but I will, because I have obligations and leaving here with him isn't an option, I just don't know how I could ever go on without him. 

Truly, he is such a good man, and is an actual gift to everyone who knows him, I don't know how any of us could go on without him.

I was beyond frustrated with with the caregiving aspect. I had said that my mother was bat shit crazy. Irrational at times. Paranoid at times as well. Just how exhausting it was. Welll today while getting mama up and ready for the day she seemed a bit of her old self. She even tried to explain her crazy wacked out frame of mind. For all intents and purposes i really think i was speaking to my mother. Not the bat shit crazy loon who has hijacked my mother. She was describing vividly the things she thought she saw. She knew they weren't real but her mind wouldn't let her see it any other way. It's like she woke up if thats possible? If i wasn't fucked up i sure am now....she had to bring up things i never knew. She mentioned my grandmother her mother had my aunt when she was 17 and in the 1940's that was scandalous. My nana had come from a very wealthy well to do family. The shame that her pregnancy brought her family. My mother and her sister are 4 years apart. My grandmother my mother's mother was extremely abusive to my mother. Also very manipulate. She had sent my aunt to go live with her mother my mother's grandmother my nanas mother. My aunt was raised by my mother's grandmother. My mother was sent to live with her as well off and on. But my mother was young she wanted her mother. She cried every day for her. My mother's grandmother sent my mother back to live with my nana my mother's mother. ( hope who is reading can follow ) my nana  was brutal physically and emotionally twords my mother. The stories my mother told us while growing up were aweful. No child should have endured what my mother did. I thought my mother told me all the stories.....um apparently not cause today in her lucidity she told me that her father had an affair with her sister and she had a baby.  ( as a teen  ) That when my aunt was older she came back to live with them. She slept with my mothers father. Apparently he wasn't her father. What the fuck did i just hear. Apparently when they were younger he had molested my aunt but my nana didn't belive her and sent her away. She kicked my mothers father out. My nana was 21 with two kids. It was also revealed by my mother that her and my aunt have diffrent fathers. What the fuck. I so don't want to know any of this. My nana has photo albums of my mothet with her father and all his face are cut out of all the pictures. I had seen those photo albums in my life time but i never asked. I just thought maybe she was angry and cut him out figuratively. But i wouldn't have ever guessed. Plus she layed on that she has a  half brother and wants mr to find him before she dies. It's not like i even know where to start. I don't wanna bring up old wounds by asking my aunt what she knows. And not to mention it makes sence why my nana beat on my mother. My mother probably reminded her of the man who did such unspeakable things to her child. It makes sence why my aunt is so quiet and has fought depression all her life. It breaks my heart. My mind is realing from all of this. I can't call nana and say hey nana is this true. She's almost 100. She's very with it. No bat shit crazy. Actually for her age my nana is very much with it. When my mom was in her crazy delusional states she would call nana and fight with her cause she said she wants answers before she leaves this world she wants to know the truth about their lives .i asked her "" why now "" she said she wants to know if all the abuse she suffered as a kid up untill 18 years old was it real. She wants her mother to confess. This is all so fucking sureal. There's so much more to these dynamicsm my mother always was telling us kids. "" what happens in our home stays in our home, no telling anyone "" my mother never spoke badly of her mother. In fact she loves her mother to death. I feel she felt rejected at times and now she's nearing the end of her life she is just gonna dump all this on me. What am i supposed to do with this information? I don't know. But I'll tell you all this i wish i never knew. Is my mother really telling secrets or is she making things up? It's still disturbing to hear. My brain and heart can't take much more of this. I'm gonna go crazy. I've never even heard about this thru the family. How could this be a secret for so long. If this is true i need to keep to myself...i don't want to know any more family secrets. This is crazy. Just had to purge this. But have others experienced this. While caring for a loved one whos close to death. Have you gotten a family secret that you never have heard before?  I listened to her. I tried to change the subject but she wasnt haveing it. She just had to tell me. I hope there is no more family secrets tomorrow. Please let me just have an easy time tomorrow.

Refusal to wear,9,a91dnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/a91dnp/refusal_to_wear/,3,1545651445.0,"My step-father has been battling prostate cancer for several years. He is in his 70's and has participated in several experimental trials which have made him incredibly sick and uncomfortable, though this last round of chemo did seem to provide some relief from pain in his bones (it still made him throw up or have diarrhea nearly daily). He has refused ""alternative medicine"" like CBD to treat pain and has preferred to remain off of opioids because of the way they affect him (making him feel loopy). He will be starting another experimental drug in a few weeks, and I feel nervous for what comes.

My mother has always been pretty masterful in terms of obfuscating the situation, but recently came home after leaving my son with her for 2 hours to finish up Christmas shopping and get some grocery items for my parents. I feel awful. I had no idea things had gotten so bad, and would have never left my son with her if I'd known. My step-father had urinated all over the floor upstairs, and my mom was frantically cleaning up after him. She admitted that it was a regular occurance, and that when he takes opioids he seems especially out of it, and pays less mind to those processes. She said he refuses to wear depends leaving her to clean up after him several times a day. She cooks for him, cleans up after him, helps him walk up and down the stairs, to sit in his chair, and yet he seems so unwilling to help her out. He also has refused to wear hearing aids, so watches the TV   with the volume up so loud that its impossible to be in the same room as he is in.

&#x200B;

My father also died of cancer, and I feel all of those feelings coming flooding back. He refused to sign paperwork and get his affairs in order because he didn't want to die. It made it so difficult for my Mom to get through that process, because as he was dying there were lawyers in the room having him sign those papers. He could barely lift his hand. I feel so bad for my Mom having to relive those experiences, and I feel so out of control. I feel like yelling at him to wear depends for the person he loves most in life. I feel like everything is just so hard.

Any words of wisdom. Ways to get through this time? Ways of thinking about things that are helpful/useful etc?

Edit: Sorry for the incomplete title.

Edit 2: I know some of these things like the TV volume seem petty. It's just one of those things that is difficult I think to come to terms with. When someone you felt very close to changes. I think I'm reacting to the difficulty in adjusting to that, and also just wishing that I could have those moments to talk with him. I feel like if he would wear hearing aids he would be able to spend better time with us, instead of complaining that people don't talk with him or spend time with him, but he is always watching television so loud that it's not possible to share time with him. I suppose the point is that I need to adjust and sit in the room with the TV up. This stuff is so hard.",2018-12-24 11:37:25

PSA: Keep your pain meds locked up!,7,9yhzh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/9yhzh9/psa_keep_your_pain_meds_locked_up/,0,1542671864.0,"Just a reminder to caregivers out there, having pain medications in the household can present personal security risks and hazards to our pets and loved ones.

I had a long conversation with my Dad’s hospice nurse towards the end. Among many other difficult subjects, we discussed the safe handling/storage/disposal of his pain meds. Thankfully we never had any issues with meds along the way, but I can see how there might have been problems under different circumstances.

Security:

Keep all of the narcotics locked in a safe or cash box when they’re not in use. Don’t talk about what meds the patient is using with anyone outside of the care team. Whenever possible, avoid using the terms “palliative care” and “hospice” when discussing the patient’s condition. You might trust the person you’re telling, but the next person he/she tells might not be so trustworthy.

Sadly, most abuse cases involve “diversion” which is to say that caregivers, family and friends are the ones most likely to divert (steal) a cancer patient’s medication for personal use or to sell. Be wary of estranged family and friends who show a sudden interest in spending time alone with, or offer to look after the patient so you can run errands etc. They may just want to help or reconnect, but keep it in the back of your mind that they might also be sniffing around for drugs. Less often, strangers or burglars will attempt to steal the meds or even commit an [armed home invasion](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/sicamous-home-invasion-1.4878969).

It’s scary to think about, but there are also industry insiders, such as palliative nurses, pharmacy workers, medical equipment delivery folks etc. -who might [attempt to steal medications](https://www.americannursetoday.com/painful-problem-drug-diversion-can/) or even tip-off potential thieves to the patient’s address. It isn’t a bad idea to take a closer look at home security. Keep doors locked and bolted, post signs for security cameras and break-in alarms (having an actual system installed would be even better), turn on flood lights at nighttime etc.

Handling and disposal:

Avoid getting liquid medications such as morphine on your skin. Wear gloves when replacing Fentanyl patches. Even used patches can lead to inadvertent absorption. Take great care with disposal. Used patches can absolutely kill a child or pet.

Depending on state or municipality, there are varying laws concerning safe disposal of meds. For example, many areas consider it illegal to throw used Fentanyl patches in the trash or sewer system. Aside from the environmental risks, abusers will literally dig through your trash to find old patches and chew on them. It’s heartbreaking stuff, but just be aware.

You should never let a hospice/palliative nurse leave with un-destroyed meds. Some care systems have methods for disposal where the meds and used patches are placed in a gel pouch that effectively destroys the medications and/or renders them poisonous. These methods normally require signatures and receipts for accountability and transport. Alternatively (preferably) you can dispose of the medications in a government-owned drop box. Just make sure you discuss this with your care team ahead of time.

Those are the main points I can think of for now, but there are a ton of resources online. A quick google will turn up information and drop box locations. [for example](https://www.health.ny.gov/professionals/narcotic/medication_drop_boxes/)

Take care, God Bless",2018-11-19 23:57:44
Depression,8,9u5tsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/9u5tsr/depression/,2,1541385514.0,"Both my husband and I are dealing with depression problems right now. We both see therapists already, so I'm not looking for that kind of help.

I don't know how to help my husband when I myself am also depressed. In the past, we've both gone through phases, but not generally at the same time. My husband has begun obsessing over minor (non-cancer related) health issues, saying that he has no purpose in life, saying he should just give up, not wanting to leave the house, etc. Today he wouldn't get out of bed. He got up to take his chemo, and then went back to bed saying he needed to sleep more. We already got an extra hour with the time change, and he finally got up to take a shower at 1:30 because I expressed my frustration. 

It's hard because I'm mad at him for giving up when there's no reason for him to do so. His health is stable. He can't work, but he's not an invalid. He could volunteer or do some other activities outside of the house, but refuses to do so. He keeps saying he wishes he were just hospitalized so he didn't have to do anything. I would have more sympathy if there was a physical reason for all of this, but his health is stable.

Meanwhile, I still have to do everything. I don't get to give up. Now I'm having to work and go to school full time on top of picking up all the slack from him. We had no food in the house this week because he didn't go to the store. We've been getting by on leftovers, but now I'm going to have to go grocery shopping and cooking. The dishes need to be done, the floors need to be vacuumed, and a million other small things. We had agreed that he would take care of the house stuff since I was going back to school. I can't physically do all of these things. There are literally not enough hours in my day. 

How come he gets to give up, but I have to keep going? Anyone have any advice?",2018-11-05 02:38:34

Last Thursday, she passed away at 4.50am in the morning. We'd gotten a call to come to the hospice immediately but missed her by 10 minutes. Her hands were still warm when we got there. I hugged her and it still felt like she was with us. The music we had put on for her was still playing, even though she was no longer here to hear it. I've been replaying the events of that day in my mind over and over for the past few days. When they told us she'd left us, when she was cremated, when we immersed her ashes in the sea. It all happened in 2 days. 

I think she might've known her time was coming to an end. She was a huge coffee lover. On the day before she passed, she asked my dad to make her a cup of coffee. She had 2 teaspoons of it and didn't want the rest. Not once in the 2.5 weeks she was hospitalised did she make a request like that. 

I went to her office for the first time after her passing 2 days ago. It was painful but comforting to look through her things. It's all I have of her now. I learned so much about her in the time I was there. She never struck me as a fiercely sentimental person as she was always so private. I found so many letters she had written to people about me when I was young. I knew she loved me, but I never realised how much. 

I always knew she'd experienced a lot of hardship in her life. I never truly knew how much until that day. It made me angry at cancer, that it would target someone who had already gone through so much. I wish I could've held her close and shared her pain when she was still alive. I wish I could've talked to her about all I learned. I hope she knows how proud I am to call her my mother. I wish she could've had more time to be happy. But I'm comforted by the fact that she's finally at peace. ",2018-08-14 20:28:21

Now he is weak, skinny and I think depressed(doesn’t leave his bed). I know the worst is yet to come, he hasn’t even started chemo yet. I tell him to try to get up more and move around and eat more now that he can because chemo is going to make him feel worse for a bit. He can talk and walk but chooses not to. I have made so many phone to the doctor, nurse practitioner, radiology department, pharmacy etc to make sure that he is being seen and treated ASAP and to make sure he gets his meds. I know idk how he feels and whats going on inside his head. I know he is probably going through the process of acceptance. I just wish he tried eating a bit more and getting up from his bed. 

He has a procedure this Tuesday and hopefully will be able to see the doctor on Friday to talk about starting chemo already. The doctor said that is the tumor shrinks with chemo, he will hopefully want to eat more. I really look forward to this bc it’s sad seeing my dad real skinny and weak.

I'm tired. And angry...and scared :(,7,6qtawt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/6qtawt/im_tired_and_angryand_scared/,6,1501582973.0,"When I was 15, my mom was diagnosed with stage III breast cancer.  She went through treatment, chemo/radiation/mastectomy, and two years later was 'cured'.  While that was happening my dad went on a few benders, got taken to rehab by fed up neighbors/friends, and generally used it as an excuse to peace out on responsibility.  

In the intervening years, they got the long overdue divorce.  My dad got remarried.  And my mom's cancer came back, 4 years ago.  She had a reaction to an antibiotic, suddenly had major ascites and, in an effort to figure out what was going on, a scan was done that showed mets in her bones.  Her liver doc didn't think it was in her liver and thought it was a drug reaction, her oncologist thought it was in her liver but diffuse.  Ascites went away as treatment began, but personally I think that was coincidence.  So did her liver doc.

She's been on hormone treatment for the last 4 years.  The last treatment being tamoxifen, which she had been on maybe 4 months.  She hadn't felt right on it since basically the start.  Last weekend, she developed ascites again.  Her oncologist did a CT scan and said she had cirrhosis and that the peritoneum was thickened.  She didn't see cancer, but she was sure it had spread.  We stopped the tamoxifen, scheduled chemo and an appt to drain the fluid from her abdomen.  

Did chemo and the drain on Thursday.  Fluid is back today.  

They're testing the fluid they removed from her abdomen for cancer cells, to type them.  I guess we'll find out Wednesday if they found any.  But a part of me wonders if this is the cancer.  She's had a genetic test which indicated she was a poor processor of tamoxifen.  Her onc completely dismissed that when we told her, saying there wasn't enough evidence to support that it would be an issue.  And my mom was on tamoxifen before, after her remission.  

But what caused the cirrhosis?  It wasn't there before tamoxifen.  

I'm wondering if the issue with the antibiotic 4 years ago damaged her liver enough to make it unable to handle tamoxifen like it could 15 years ago.  

I don't want to be delusional but I feel like this is a reasonable explanation for what's going on.  Tamoxifen has done this to other people, caused ascites.  Anecdotally, but I found two other instances on forums.  I don't want them to assume the treatment isn't working and move on.  I don't want her to go into liver failure.  But I'm terrified that it has spread, too.  

She didn't remarry, and it's just me and my brother.  He doesn't really comprehend the potential severity of the situation.  I lived at her house up until I bought my own in February.  I'm so relieved that I got out before this happened, because I'd never have left if this happened before I did.  And I feel awful for thinking that.  My brother still lives with her, so I figure it's only fair I take her to all her appointments, I stay with her through chemo, I field her questions, look up her symptoms and treatments (I have an MS from the uni affiliated with her cancer hospital and spent 2 years there doing cancer research, actually, so I understand why she's asking me to do it, but it's mentally taxing).

I'm rambling.  I'm sorry.  I'm just so angry this is all happening.  And I'm pissed at my father for running away like a coward, and making a new life while leaving me to deal with his addiction (I had to do 2 interventions for him after rehab - at 22 and again when I was 24 - before he finally got his shit together), then to deal with this.  And then getting annoyed that I didn't have time to text him back about a stupid barbecue he was planning last weekend.  

I feel like so much of my life has revolved around this disease.  I took care of her back when I was in high school, continued through college while she was getting her reconstruction, and then the fucking thing came back when I was 27.  And I'm taking care of her again.  I don't know if she's dying, like actually dying, and I feel like I can't trust her oncologist to consider any explanation that's not cancer.  I'm so tired of this shit and being the strong one.  I feel like I'm holding back on parts of my life because of her and knowing how much she depends on me.  And I kind of resent her for it too.  And a tiny part of me wonders if I'll be relieved when she dies.  Even though I'm pretty sure I'll just be miserable.  And I feel like a horrible person for even thinking it.  

I don't know what I'm looking for with this post.  I'm just tired.

The amazing doctors provided wonderful treatment and sent him straight to radiation. He does not have insurance so we applied for social security. The oncologist and the radiologist treated him anyway while we waited on the results of social security. Social security put him on medical hold until August. I feel sick to my stomach. This means we can't get anymore treatment unless the oncologists are willing to take him in for another 2 months no charge. That's highly unlikely (and I don't blame them they've done so much). I'm the only one who can work and have been killing myself with overtime just to pay for the meds all while taking care of him. He's unable to walk without crutches or bathe or feed himself. I just feel sick to my stomach that they could do something like this. On the phone with the agent he basically said if it's spread to other organs by August they can help.

Taking care of mom is hard,8,6dxtkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/6dxtkl/taking_care_of_mom_is_hard/,4,1496055005.0,"My mom was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer 4 years ago. Cancer was one, thing, but hearing stage 3 was the worst day of my life. Since then, her cancer has now gone metastatic. She has tumors in her neck (encasing her carotid artery), her lungs, and spine. She is a single mother of two, my sister and I (30 and 27) are now taking turns caring for her even though we both live in different states.

Since the tumor on her neck, my mom effectively sounds like Minnie Mouse. I know it bothers her, and frankly it's often hard to understand her. She's always kept to herself not wanting her daughters to worry. But now I can tell in her face she has so much to say but too embarrassed to talk.

The radiation of her spine has been the worst yet. The neck was pretty bad. Had to make a run to the ER once from the pain. But with the spine she is constantly in pain and uncomfortable. Pain and anxiety meds only do so much. She's barely eating and down to 89lbs. We have physical therapists and nurses visiting, but taking care of her is hard. 

I don't know when to push her to do things and when to let her rest. I don't know if she actually thinks my food tastes bad or she is just being stubborn. It feels like she's given up sometimes and I don't know how to approach the situation. Sometimes I want to just scream and cry and run away. Not witnessing deterioration first hand would be so much easier. 

My mom took care of me, I got married and my husband takes care of me, and now my mom is sick and I have to take care of her and have no idea how. I don't know how to enjoy my time with her when she is so miserable. I don't know if my sister and I should start making funeral arrangements. It's such a rollercoaster. Often times I think she is doing great despite everything, but then something else shakes me back into violent reality.",2017-05-29 10:50:05

Overprotective from visiting family,8,jla4u0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/jla4u0/overprotective_from_visiting_family/,3,1604138321.0,"Hello, I’m fairly new to the group though I (28f) have been taking care of my partner (30m) for about a year. I know lots of conversations about caregiving during covid are happening, so I’m sorry if this is redundant. 
This month we learned his colon cancer metastasized to his lungs, via zoom with the oncologist following his biopsy. My partner added his parents onto the zoom call. Before covid he and I would attend his appointments/treatments together in person. 

I love his family but they all live out of state and want to come visit without quarantining first, though they’re aware of the risk. They’re very smart people and just care about him, but the last time they did this for his first round of chemo, we were hosting family every other weekend (sometimes even coming over when he had expressly said he preferred to rest). They are lovely people, but headstrong and determined once they make a decision, but it drained us both. He said it was exhausting though when they were here he tried so hard to be present. They would bring food he couldn’t stomach/digest, and leave a huge mess I would spend hours cleaning. Once an elderly relative visited our apartment after he had just returned from the hospital following his colectomy and she used our one bathroom for long periods of time when he painfully could not wait for that. He said absolutely nothing while being the most uncomfortable I’ve ever seen him but I couldn’t say anything about it. 

He told me it is what it is, and he isn’t scared of getting covid despite numerous conversations about it; it’s like we’re on the same page of how risky it is, but he doesn’t want to make waves with his family. When they’re here, they want to drive him in a compact car (unmasked), eat in very close proximity unmasked, and have suggested he move back with them for treatment and have pressed for inquiring about surgery as a solution (oncologist has said it doesn’t work that way). He has not contested anything, but has been firm about not moving out. 
I feel like the nag, I feel overprotective and every time we try to have this conversation I just start to cry and the conversation stops. He has hardly cried and never loses his temper, while throughout this I have cried frequently, randomly, and I usually do so where he can’t see/hear me. 
I don’t want to see a repeat of last year, but already his family is planning to fly up next weekend, without any extra period of quarantine. 
I can’t consult my own family; they love him a lot and love his family, but then say they would like to all hang out together when they are in town! Which would be worse!! So I am not telling them when they’re coming up. 

Do you just embrace being overprotective? I want to respect his agency and relationship with his family, but how can I enforce that if they do what they want anyway? And I don’t understand how he can know how dangerous it is yet believe he would be fine (especially since it has now spread to his lungs). I feel like causing him stress by making waves with his family would also be detrimental to him while he’s already going through the stress of this diagnosis. His family has been very loving with me despite the stress their visits put us both through and I don’t want to hurt our relationship long term, though my mental health has hit a wall.

Im a 24 year old male and my father suffers from braincancer.  
My dad was diagnosed with an aggressive braincancer 2 years ago, and today it hit me, that he might only have days or weeks to live.  
His cancer caused brain-damage, so he has no empathy, which i have gotten used to over the years, but 1 month ago he also got dementia, from his radiation therapy, which has gradually gotten worse the last couple of weeks. Today he didnt remember me, which was the hardest thing i have experienced in my life thus far.

Caregiving during a Pandemic,7,irjqm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/irjqm9/caregiving_during_a_pandemic/,0,1599970058.0,"Hi, my mother (76) was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic ovarian cancer this past December,  and had her first treatment in the hospital due to the complications she was having. She left the hospital at the end of January on a TPN, not having been able to eat solid food for the previous two months, two weeks after I was laid off.  
Then we had to rush to the ER a day and half after discharg where they diagnosed a perforated bowl. She went through major surgery, suffered a mini stroke, went through rehab and finally came home in March, just before our state was locked down. 
She has now gone through two treatments of chemo after the long interruption and has suffered another mini stroke and I am fearful her oncologist won't continue treatment for the cancer because of the effects. I am also terrified of the next effect if he continues. 
I am her main caretaker,  though my bf of 19yrs is a godsend and huge help, but with her fear of the virus she won't even allow my brother to visit, let alone help.
I am feeling very overwhelmed with the demands of being her caretaker while trying to deal with the possibility of losing my mother and her not being able to see my brother. 
I really just needed to say all this, as I really need to be the strong one so often that I am beginning to feel like I am going to break.

Advice regarding relationship,8,hydzon,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/hydzon/advice_regarding_relationship/,17,1595823648.0,"I 36f was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer 5 months ago. My partner 35m and I had been together just over a year and a half, everything was perfect, we were so happy and had plans for the future - children etc.

To say this diagnosis has ripped our world apart is an understatement. I've been doing well, I still work 20 hours a week and have been handling chemo relatively well. If you didn't know me you wouldn't know I was sick to look at. 

My issue is we have only been intimate once sonce I was diagnosed. Before that it was often, we were so in love. I still feel those feelings towards him but he seems to have lost them towards me. I do cry a lot and am terrified about what's going to happen to me in the future so am wondering if my mental state has effected him. 

I don't know how to fix it but it's making me so depressed and even more guilty that he been forced upon this roller-coaster of hell. I've tried talking to him about it, I thought maybe he wasn't attracted to me anymore. He said it's not that, he said he's still in love with me and still attracted to me but has gone from feeling like my lover to a caregiver and he can't seperate the two. I don't understand because as of now I'm still able to do everything myself. He's said he's had to think about my funeral and prople constantly asking him how I am all the time and he's sad and depressed a lot too. 

My fear is that he'll end up finding someone else. I'd rather he left me now than 2 years down the track, it would destroy me. I've told him I would completely understand if he needed to leave but he won't. I get the feeling it's more of a duty to him than actually wanting to be there. I could be wrong but my self esteem is very low at the moment because of this. 

I'm just so lost, just hoping there's a male around our age out there that's been through the same thing with his partner? Were you put off her sexually because of the diagnosis? How did you get through it?

She started having some health issues a few months ago and we found out just days ago that she has 3 tumors in her liver and there really isnt anything we can do about it. She is adamant that she doesnt want to spend the rest of her life going through treatment or being sick. She is open to possibly looking into clinical trials depending on what they are but after researching that a little bit im not very optimistic about any of this honestly. she asked me to look into a life insurance policy and this is where ive hit a brick wall and am not sure where to turn. it looks like its going to be very difficult to get a policy for her that doesnt include a 2 to 3 yr waiting period. everywhere i turn im being stopped with that big road block. the only advice ive gotten from anyone so far is to save the money we would be spending on the policy payments to use when the time comes bc that is about the only option for her. i would greatly appreciate any comments or suggestions please. please help me help my mom,2020-05-14 11:15:08

She was diagnosed in September of 2019 with Clear Cell Carcinoma. It is a very rare type of ovarian cancer that does not respond well to traditional treatments. 

Her surgery was on Valentine's day. The doctor's called it the Mother of all surgeries. They only operated on her because she was in otherwise good health and she had a family. She is currently on round 2 of post surgery chemotherapy that is planned for the next four months. 

We adopted a special needs girl from China two years ago. I am having such a hard time with her as she has regressed into 3-4 year old behavior since cancer has struck. 

I am 44 and I'm not sure how to take care of myself. I feel guilty doing anything for myself. I feel guilty for not being there while my kids are sad (all the times). My feelings are all over the place but I try not to feel because it prevents me from doing things that need to get done. But I seemed to be experiencing more despair.

First time poster. My mom has been fighting breast cancer stage 4 for now 9 years and counting. It's been a long road for her and an emotional rollercoaster for me. I have also whitnessed her in and out of the hospital for surgeries and other significant health issues my whole life so probably have some form of PTSD from it all on top of a pretty significant anxiety disorder that my doctor ignores as 'work stress,' but I digress. 

 I have two siblings on my mom's side. Sister,18 and brother, 15. I'm 29. I know a lot of responsibility falls on me just because of that age gap. And it has.  After being in liver failure last March 2018, she has started chemo again and is now been hospitalized 3-4 times due to fluid accumulating and pain. I say 3-4 as I've lost count and it's really stressful.

Anywho. She'll be meeting with her oncologist tomorrow and I'll go with her as I've done now for the majority of her latest treatments aside from the beginning before she got honest with the severity of the cancer . These visits are boring, scary, and painful to see all at the same time for me and it causes great stress in my work and relationship with my husband and friends. 

Well, to get to the point of my post...l'm scared and tired. I don't want to sound cruel or anything but I don't want to be around her more than I have to. This hurts me a lot to say but it is so stressful, painful, and terrifying for me to hear about the symptoms, that she's in pain etc everytime I see or talk to her. I just want her to be okay. She's my best friend and I can't imagine her not being in my life.
 
This weekend, my husband and I hung out with family for goose hunting and it was great. Found out that she did the same and helped my aunt and uncle can from their massive garden. Last week she was hospitalized and we discussed my aunt and uncle will take responsibility of her health directive so I or my siblings don't have to. For that, I am so thankful. I can't express it enough how much I appreciate not having that burden. I love my family and am happy they can step up when I feel stuck, like I can't do it anymore. I'm thankful for them and I believe it will help me cope with it better. I can only hope.

Metastasize Already!,8,cncsoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/cncsoy/metastasize_already/,2,1565246208.0,"I (F47) been my father's (M66) caregiver now for 2 years 8 months.  He has a rare cancer (Angiosarcoma - a 1% kind of cancer) and of the rareness of the cancer it is 1% of the group that has it on his face.

Jan 2017 was his diagnosis, then chemo until Jul where his heart was damaged (bundle branch block) and neuropathy became too much, so they stopped it. In December they started another chemo and within 2 weeks of his first infusion he was in the hospital with no white blood count.  January 2018 they decide to move to radiation and that started in March and finished in May when he said no more.  

So while the chemo and radiation helped keep it at bay (too invasive for surgery before or after these treatments to remove any of the tumours), the tumours are now quite active and he has leaking wounds in his face (brow, both cheeks, nose and now a new one which has bored it's way from cheek into his mouth.  He also appears now to have sores across his bottom gums (he has no teeth).  Add to that, that in January/March he had cataract surgery and then and three weeks ago he required a cornea transplant which has been another complication in his life.

All of this to say...he's an angry, depressed, very pessimistic man.  Back in March I almost told him to leave (he lives with me) as I could not deal with him anymore (my first post here).  In April, 1 week after coming back from a Cuba vacation with my sister, I did tell him to get out.  The support system we have here in Ontario (LINH support) was tried to find him a place to stay but during their search he changed his mind (though I didn't remember asking him too, lol).

End of  May one morning as I am just about to go to work he tells me he definitely wants to go to a Long-Term Care facility and I tell him okay, he should call his support worker and then he freaks out asking me why he should have to do that (um, you're a 67 year old man who can use a phone?)...but I do that for him.  This ends with him being admitted to the hospital as he tells them that he wants out of my home because he cannot care for himself anymore (forgets when to take medications, etc - but in reality he doesn't forget he was actually mad as they had just changed his meds and there were even 'more' pills) and so he stayed there for a week.

After putting himself there, wouldn't you know it, that night I get a call that he doesn't want to be there, he knows nothing, they won't talk to him, etc.  This call happened every day, sometimes twice and he wanted to go home, but they were not having it.  What they were trying to do was get his medications under control and see what worked, what didn't, etc.  He was released a week later, his medications are now bubble packaged to help him remember if he has or has not taken them etc.  Meanwhile, LINH support was still trying to find a place for him and they come out talk to him about some options and he decides he doesn't want to go there and he's staying.

It's now August...his wounds leak around the clock - he is understandably upset about it, his eyes (which were never the same after radiation) are not playing nice (cornea transplant one is still healing and almost sewn shut to help) and he's just been so negative that I really just want the cancer to move from his face and hit somewhere that will kill him.  I know that sounds so bad and evil, but when you hear your father say he just wants to end it...constantly (just heard it 15min ago when helping him with his eye drops), I just want it to be over. 

He's angry all the time that no one is doing anything for him (he has a daily nurse visit!), but he doesn't associate his wounds with his cancer which astounds me.  I try to calmly talk to him that they really cannot do anything if he's not opting for treatment...palliative is where he placed himself and it is only going to get worse. I am just so tired.  I love my father, I do, but this man has been like a child instead of father to me off and on since my early 20s with one mental or health situation after the other. 

Thank you for listening.

TL:DR I've been my father's caregiver for almost 3 years and his constant complaining, negativity and grumpiness is killing me and I want it to end.",2019-08-08 06:36:48
My sister just got diagnosed with breast cancer and will be having surgery in a week. She is only 33 years old and my heart breaks every time I think about the life long journey that awaits her.

Feel free to share anything that's going on in your life, not just the cancer stuff! 

I'm going to try to make one of these threads each month and pin it to the top. 

I'll start it off:

I went on a little solo vacation last week to [Wizarding World of Harry Potter]( https://photos.app.goo.gl/VkD5yuhRUXiZGbUj8) and I'm glad I did because we're in full cancer-fighting mode this week. Hubby is in the hospital for pain right now while we wait and figure out which treatment to do next. He has carcinoid and had been taking oral chemo (Afinitor) for the last 4.5 years. Now he's likely starting PRRT or a different oral chemo (Temodar) once the doctors can get their shit together.

He developed some serious aggression and behavioral issues because of having treatment at such a young age. The biggest problem I'm having right now, though, is trying to get him to eat anything but junk. When he was sick, and going through his treatment, they told us that if he was willing to eat something, no matter what it was, to let him eat it. Well, that helped in maintaining his weight and growth while he was sick, but now I'm stuck with a toddler that won't eat real food, ever. 

I'm worried about his nutritional needs being met, and for a while, I could sneak things into his food and drinks to help, like supplements and veggie purees. Now, it's almost like he's figured out what I'm doing, and refuses anything that I can possibly supplement. It's frustrating and infuriating, and I'm at a loss as to what to do. 

Has anyone else ever run into this type of problem with children who underwent, or are currently going through treatment? I'm just so worried. He is starting to look sickly, and he's stopped growing as quickly again. ",2019-03-12 04:10:01
Psychosis in late stage brain cancer,7,az81us,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/az81us/psychosis_in_late_stage_brain_cancer/,0,1552194092.0,"Sorry if formatting is weird, posting from phone and also first post in this forum. 

My mum has been battling metastasised breast cancer for around 3 years now. In the last month her health has gone downhill and nausea has caused her to loose a bunch of weight. Shes always been slim so she didnt really have the weight to loose. Shes also been very forgetful and having a lot of vision and balance issues. We thought this was a lack of food intake. 

However, yesterday she was taken to the hospital in an ambulance after dad found her nearly comatose. She has made multiple calls to myself and other family members confused as to where she is and paranoid about people hurting her. 
I went into the hospital last night and stayed until 2am helping her to sleep and she did calm down while I was there. The whole time she kept saying she was seeing cats and children running around. 
My dad called this morning, hes at the hospital now. She got even worse after we left the hospital.  

We have since learned that it's not malnutrition, its the cancer that spread to her brain lining causing the brain to swell. 
She was okay last week and I am really struggling with this sudden change and I'm scared that this is a sign I am loosing her. 
I suffer from severe anxiety and depression and my mum is one of my closest humans. I cant bare the thought of being without her. I became suicidal last year when she had her last flare up. 
On top of that, I run my own business and I have a very important event that I am meant to be flying overseas to attend this Thursday. My finances are wrecked and I'm relying on this event to feed my family for the next few months. But I'm feeling like I cant leave because I might be loosing my mum. I'm torn between the time I have right now with her, and any future I hope to have with my business. 

Sorry for the long post, I dont really know what I am looking to achieve but I am just feeling very lost and hopeless today. ",2019-03-10 05:01:32
My mom my best freind,7,a5dof6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/a5dof6/my_mom_my_best_freind/,8,1544609367.0,"This has been going on to long. When does the body give up? My mother is dying. We made a promise my sister and i before she got really sick. We wouldn't put her in a nursing home. We would do everything in our power to let her be able to die at home with dignity. I feel like we we're to quick to agree cause shit's gotten real. Painfully real. I don't know if i know what happy is anymore. My heart literally aches daily. I barely can function. My marriage is so strained. My financial 
sistuation is almost to the point of me just giving up. Our life savings is gone!! 17 grand saved to buy a house but not anymore. We have exactly $249 in the bank and bills that total to 5 grand a month. 

My mother has bone cancer. This is her third cancer since 1999. First breast second uterine last but not least the killer. Matatisized from her uterine cancer fucking bone cancer the killer. 

She got into the keytruda studies. Dana Farber in boston is running trials cause Keytruda is a gene therapy. After all she has had her life time of chemo with her 2 other cancers. She had one of the genes they think will work with the Keytruda. 

She started off good in the spring but her doctor decided to give her surgery cause her bone cancer and cancerous masses were pinching a nerve that controls her leg. She was very alert last spring. Her doctor from Dana Farber told her her quality of life would be better.

My mother has always been so strong. Never depended on anyone for anything. She was very active with her daily life. She went with this surgery.

Things got fucked up during surgery. After all this was also experimental. The idiea is was to go in lapercopic and freeze the tumors and the Keytruda would attack the cancer cells that might try to excape to other organs in turn they hoped for a better quality of life.

That surgery went wrong. The doctor froze the nerve to the leg. Wich made het immobile. That surgery landed my strong mother in to a nursing home that almost killed her. They gave her wrong meds she was there for a month. They didn't give her paxil for a month as well as her morphine and 20 mlgs xtra of her blood presure meds. They neglected her to the utmost degree. She left that place traumatized. As well as the family. We could sue but she didn't want to.

Wich leads us to today. Her decline is faster now. But before she got sick she made myself and sister promise that we wouldn't put her in a nursing home or have people in her house. She made it very clear that she wanted to die at home. 

As she declines the harder it is to keep her home. We found out she has tumors on her brain. She has three of them..they are pressing in all the wrong places in her brain. Sundowners is the worst. She forget to even know how to get out of her wheel chair. She is now a two person transfer. We have to diaper her daily/nightly. 

She fights myself and sister about safety issues. She will not get out of her wheel chair into her safe chair. Berrnie n Phil awesone chair that lifts her from a sit to a standing position.

Taking care of our mothers needs is so time consuming. I have a full time job wich starts at 10thirty but for me to get there on time i have to get to my job so I'm at her house at 6thirty am. Sometimes i don't leave untill ten brcause you cant rush her or she'll cry. 

So for hours litterly she will look at the tsgs on the clothes that I'm gonna dress her in. She needs to inspect everything. She takes 1/2 an hour to take her meds. She thinks my sister and i are trying to poison her. She has severe paranoid thoughts. Thinks were stealing her clothes. And my loving mother has turned into this mess of a mean mother to a out to lunch lunatic meaning her brain is toast. 

We need to get help in there. My sister has little kids. Her and her husband seperated over this with my mom needing all this care and help. My husband and i fear are one fight away to the same fate.

The care is extremely exhausting!! Plus working on top of it. Something has to break. We dont want to put her in a nursing home. But she's one fit away from becoming combative. She swats at us now. She has hauled off and giving a quick left handed upper cut. It was so fast. I know i can't take that personal but...

I'n so over tiered. I cant stand that my mother is loosing het mind. Are we supposed to see our parents so vulnerable. 

A girl.at work caught me cryimg cause i do that daily too becaude i feel so guilty that i'm not doing enoughf for her or if she really knows it's almost time to leave us. She said to me "" once a child twice a mother "" i love that saying. That saying really does relate.

I whole heartedly am trying to mother my mother now. Is this why people put their loved ones on a nursing home? They can't take the pain of watching death get closer. I can tell you it fucking hurts. If i could trade places i would. I feel so unbelievably sad and want this all to end in a good way. If she ends up in a nursing home i don't think i could live with myself. 

I just need a little me time to recharge.

Venting about care,8,8u9m06,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/8u9m06/venting_about_care/,4,1530134941.0,"I’m just venting here about the never ending task that is cancer. I’m sorry if this is not appropriate for this subreddit. 

My wife has appendix cancer, signet ring, goblet cell. This came out of nowhere in January 2018 after she had her appendix removed. She had a hemicolectomy to remove the cancer and is now going through 12 rounds of folfox chemotherapy. 

The odds are not good for long term survival with 25% at 5 years and a 50 month average survival. All of this is just odds, and some people do make it past this. 

My wife’s blood counts are low, so they are planning a transfusion. The doctor is trying to limit her impact so is only giving her one unit today, with another CBC tomorrow and a potential second unit on Friday. 

She has a MRI on Thursday too for massed in her brain, spine and neck. 

She has her 9th folfox on Monday. 

I am depressed from before all of this, facing issues at work, and trying to keep my son on track for a fun summer and dealing with his ADHD.

The Whirlwind,7,7sjtus,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/7sjtus/the_whirlwind/,5,1516788693.0,"Hi, my name is Todd. My wife of 20 years has been diagnosed with Stage IV Lung Cancer (Metastatic Non-Small Cell Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma) She has METS in her brain, skull, lumbar spine, orbital sockets, adrenal glands, bladder, hip, and bowels. I'm sure there are more but these are the ones that stuck in my mind. The strange thing is that the largest mass is in her right orbital socket. 

Starting in late October, my wife started to get ""floaters"" in the peripheral vision of her right eye every now and then. As they got to be more consistent, she slowly started to lose the peripheral vision in the top part of that eye. Not having insurance, she put off going until we had the money. Our thinking was that her glasses/contacts RX had changed.

On December 5th she went to the local eye Dr. to have an exam. Dx: Detached Retina. 2 hrs later we are at the Retinal Specialist. He takes one look and I can tell by the immediate look on his face that it isn't good. He called it an ""Abnormal mass of cells"" 2.7cm x 1.1cm x 0.9cm. They schedule us an appointment to see an Oncologist.

See the Oncologist 2 days later and they order a PET scan and a MRI of the skull and orbits. The next Friday they drop the bomb on us. My wife had 3 biopsies(sp) done. The first 2 were inconclusive but said that the best educated guess would be Malignant Melanoma because my wife is a redhead with fair skin. 3rd biopsy was an actual surgical procedure to make sure they get enough material to get all of the genetic markers that they need to give a rock solid Dx.

In the meantime, my wife starts a series of 10 whole brain, orbital socket, and lumbar spine radiation treatments. This past Thursday they threw us a bit of a curveball when they told us that it was actually lung cancer and not melanoma. They didn't use the phrase ""terminal"" but did say incurable.

Radiation started January 3rd and in just this short time, I have watched my beautiful wife turn into a shell of her former self. As expected, she lost her hair. Though she has an oddly beautiful shaped head sans hair. She has gone from someone who you would never see sitting still, to sleeping 18+hrs/day. When she is awake she is resting in my new (her new) recliner. Her appetite hasn't been effected yet, but I know that with chemo, that will change.

I am so terrified about starting chemo. I am watching who she was disappearing in real time. I feel like the center of my universe is being swallowed by a black hole. I am trying to stay strong for her, but they facade is starting to crack. 

I had a back injury over the summer and was unable to work. I just got cleared to return to work and then....boom. I can't work now because she requires a constant caregiver and her need for me will only continue to grow as this progresses. 

Don't get me wrong, there is no other place I would rather be than right by her side helping/demanding that she fight as long as she can. We have 2 children that are 23 and 16. Not babies, but still to young to be losing their mother. My 16 yr old son has Autism and this is going to destroy him. She is everything to him. She is everything to all of us, but he really leans on her. He has overcome so much, I hope that this doesn't cause him to regress.

Sorry this is so long. I just had to get it out. I am trying to stay strong for her and the kids but I have my moments when I can't be strong. I'm losing my best friend, confidiant, the love of my life, and it is crushing my soul. I wish I could take it from her and suffer in her place.

Anger,6,jjp0go,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/jjp0go/anger/,10,1603924974.0,"    I know that Anger is a part of grieving, but I feel guilty for feeling so much anger towards my husband of 28yrs who is going through Lung Cancer, which is now a stage4. 
   The tumor is massive. 9cm. They were able to get it to shrink by 2cm,  through radiation, to open the airway. The things is, they said he could live with it as long as they can keep it from growing and spreading. 
    With death standing in our front yard, I don’t understand why he won’t do what he’s told to do by the doctors. 
     He refuses to eat. Not because he’s nauseous. He says he just doesn’t want to. Then he complains and wants sympathy because he has no energy and can’t walk very well. If I try getting him to eat even a small amount of anything, he gets angry. He sips water occasionally, then tells the doc he gets 32oz a day (getting mad again when I say I don’t believe it’s that much). He refuses to admit he smokes, but goes to the garage and I can smell it when he comes back in (he goes out there when I leave the room and doesn’t need help walking. When I catch him, he makes up some lame excuse why he needed to go out there). He got mad when I explained to him that if he doesn’t eat/drink he’s going to be back in the hospital, but it’s the truth. To him “eating” is drinking 2oz of Boost and eating one 4oz pudding cup for the entire day. 
   It’s so frustrating and irritating that he puts himself into situations where he wants sympathy, then refuses it. He moans as he’s talking very quietly, and gets mad when I can’t understand him (miraculously able to speak clearly as he’s stating that I don’t ever listen). He talks bad about the kids not coming to see him, but when they ask if they can, he makes them feel bad for trying to spread germs to him, so they don’t. 
   His brother told me it’s like a wounded dog. He hurts and needs me but will nip at me because he hurts. And that I don’t need to be so sensitive. What the hell am I suppose to do? Allow him to not eat or drink?!! Allow him to yell at me and make me feel like a worthless wife because I don’t know what he wants?!!! 
   He thinks he has at least 10yrs left. I think he has 6 months tops (like I said, the tumor is huge, while on chemo it spread to his liver and adrenal glad. He refuses to eat. How can a body survive that). I just want our last bit of time to be of good memories, not this. 
    Please tell me it’s okay(?)/normal(?)/acceptable(?) to get so mad at him while he is in the process of dying. If I’m wrong, I’d appreciate someone..anyone...tell me that I am! I just want my head where it needs to be so I can deal with this!!

*I want everyone to know that I talked with the Oncology Nurse today. She is going to note in his file the slim amount he has eaten in the past week and put in my request for some sort of appetite stimulant. I can’t express how much your responses have helped me today.

My uncle is down to 110 lbs from 200. Does anyone have any creative tips for meals?

Mom is coming to the end of her 8+ year battle. Dad is waiting to see if he has cancer.,7,ikklc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/ikklc8/mom_is_coming_to_the_end_of_her_8_year_battle_dad/,2,1598997002.0," **I tried posting to** r/cancer **but it was immediately deleted.** 

My  mom was diagnosed with anal cancer when she went in to have hemorrhoids  removed in the spring of 2012. I was living out of state and actually  had gotten injured myself the day I was told. I was new to my job, which  caused the injury, so I couldn't take time off to see my mom. She had  chemo & radiation, and was good to go by fall. She actually flew to  see me for a few days when I had my surgery.

I  got a settlement from work, my girlfriend graduated college, and we  moved back to my parents in 2015 to recover and help my parents out  while they looked for a smaller house. Mom wasn't really able to take  care of the house anymore due to her low energy levels. We started a  nice home based eBay business so I could help my parents out and my  girlfriend got a job for the health insurance. We realized that they  just weren't going to move because I made their lives so much easier, so  we started looking for houses, then we got the call.

In  July 2017 her last scan after 5 years found new cancer in her right  lung, they immediately removed the lower lobe. For some reason and  against guidelines, she was not given antibiotics. She got a bad  infection and spent 2 weeks after her surgery in the ICU. That stopped  us from looking at places, I had to take over her babysitting that  summer because she still insisted on seeing all the kids in the extended  family.

She found out 3 months  later that they missed some of the cancer and she needed more chemo and  radiation. Winter of 2017/18 was spent with my stepdad taking her 4 days  a week on round trips to the cancer center that's over 40 miles away  for radiation and me taking her once weekly for a four hour chemo  session.

Fall of 2018 her cancer  metastasized to the brain, she had to go to Pittsburgh for Gamma Knife  treatment. Spring 2019 it came back, more Gamma Knife. It was fine for a  few months, then in the fall a scan revealed that the cancer was  basically all over her torso. She called all her friends out in January  to see them one last time, and committed to another round of chemo, she  has had her lifetime allotment of radiation. The chemo was once every 3  weeks and took a terrible toll this time, she actually developed an  allergic reaction to one of the chemo drugs and they had to switch to  something else mid-treatment.  It didn't shrink the tumors, but they  didn't grow. They told her that she would need to be on the chemo once  every 3 weeks for the rest of her life. She chose to forgo treatment and  start hospice.

Its been a few  months on hospice and she is in a great deal of pain and very nauseous.  They aren't really sure if it's all the painkillers or the cancer but  she has been on everything to stop the vomiting, but still has issues.  She's lost so much weight and recently lost the ability to walk or even  hold herself up really.  I don't think she has long left, weeks maybe.

Mom  has the Medical Cannabis card and I make her edibles, and roll her  joints. She had me make her 50mg gummies with distillate, they help her,  but sometimes she doesn't want them because she will eat too many and  sleep. I made her peanut butter cookies for the 2017/18 chemo, and she  was actually able to put on weight during the treatments. She was  refusing the edibles during her last treatment, said she hated that they  tasted ""too weedy"". She was smoking cannabis, as she had since 1974. I  looked into it and found the distillate does not have the same taste  because of how it's made and now make sure she is stocked with joints  and gummies to help her be comfortable.

I  am trying to do the best I can for her as her caregiver, my dad helps  but he works full time and is dealing with his own health issues. He is  diabetic, needs a double knee replacement, & waiting on test results  right now to see if the spot on his kidney is cancer. His younger  brother is dealing currently with kidney cancer that was recently  discovered to be growing into the spine, making it inoperable. His  little sister is dealing with MS. Dad is severely depressed, not  sleeping, and not really able to help much. He was looking at a small  house to buy, but now I kinda worry that he won't leave and I will have  to care for him while he goes through treatments, or refuses treatments  in his depressed state. I don't know how to help him.",2020-09-01 21:50:02

My boyfriend has leukemia and I don’t know how to help,6,g6ja8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/g6ja8s/my_boyfriend_has_leukemia_and_i_dont_know_how_to/,3,1587661056.0,"Hello!! 
Okay so for starters, I have a handful of mental health issues and so I’m not the happiest person ever ya know. One of the disorders is obsessive compulsive disorder. And so It gives me a severe fear of others dying and me feeling responsible even though I’m not so I have to do the compulsions to get rid of the fear that loved ones will pass. 
So my boyfriend and I are both 19. He’s been diagnosed with Acute leukemia and his is more treatable than others which is incredibly lucky so I’m thankful for that. He’s been getting treatment since September 2017 I believe, and his treatment ends in the new year.. so, soon. He’s having a difficult time coping with the idea of not taking chemo medications anymore out of fear that it’ll return.. which IS possible. I go to every single hospital visit for his chemo, I drive him there and home, buy him breakfast before hand or help him fall asleep. But he keeps his emotions to himself. And I know that having cancer and losing so much of your life would be hard to process. He missed his high school graduation because he couldn’t walk. He spent so much time away from normal kid things he never got to experience that. He keeps his feelings in and every so often starts to act funny. I’m super good at talking to people about emotions so I tried to help him open up so he can get some pressure off his chest and he just cried. And I don’t know what to even say when he does. I go on and on about how he’s worth so so much and that this makes him stronger than everyone else and that life has so much more to offer. And I try to find as many positives and opportunities as possible for him but I mean, what can you even say? 
Note: If it did come back after his treatment ends, they would do a bone marrow transplant and that’s the last option. If that fails, there is nothing they can do for him. which makes the whole situation even more scary since he has to live knowing it could come back right? 
I can’t help him physically so I want to mentally help him but I don’t know how. When he does open up he always feels better after but it’s hard to start the conversation because he’s trying to hide it. I’ve suggested writing his emotions in his notes but he can’t seem to find the words. 
I know he’s really hurting inside and I hate watching this happen to him. 

Any tips would help if you’ve experienced something similar. Or just coping mechanism for yourself (because I sometimes break down over it but I can’t let him see that I’m scared too because I wanna make him feel stronger)

He probably will die in a matter of days, if not hours. 

I live in Mexico City, he lives in a nearby city. We're currently in the moment where coronavirus cases ramp up, and I'm questioning whether to go see him and go to the funeral. 

Currently one of my brothers is with him, but I'd have contact with my aunts (60+ all of them and with a bit of health issues) and with my mom (60 and with diabetes and blood pressure issues), so I'm questioning whether it would be a good idea to even show up. 

I live in a much more connected place than them, plus a bus trip, I wouldn't want to risk exposure. I've had enough time to say goodbye and there is certainly enough people to make all the necessary arrangements. 

Would it be worth to risk the trip and risk exposure for the rest of my family?

He was on an experimental treatment but didn’t get a bone marrow transplant and chemo until August 2018.  Besides gout from the chemo pop was fine until suddenly that October he was diagnosed with hosts disease and stayed untll A few days before Halloween 

We thought he was going to be fine until a few days after Christmas but before New Year’s Eve he got a fever and had to be taken to the ER.

Pop stayed there again until maybe March-May where he was diagnosed with cancer in his hips which he got radiation for and I think leukemia (even though it’s practically the same as the blood cancer). He was also defecating in the hospital bed dropping to 100 pounds. Pop went to rehab in February.

After a stint in the hospital from May-June pop was able to come with us to Florida and go on the rides at Disney even though he had to be pushed around in a wheelchair for almost Everything. 

Really can’t remember much of July-October but In November he was back to the hospital and we found out he didn’t have a long time to live - cancer in his heart and brain that couldn’t be treated which meant the only option was living the last of his days out in the hospital or end of life home hospice care.

Pop didn’t want to be in the hospital anymore so the hospital gave him painkillers, a few other things and a plastic potty in case he couldn’t make it to the bathroom even despite the attached bathroom. 

Pop started getting delusions and hallucinations in December: he told aunt crystal he was going to the beach one Friday when it was 41 degrees out telling her there was sandwiches out in the garage waking around in his underwear telling me it was a bathing suit and making a seat in the (pretend) sand with a blanket and his walker. 

Two nights before Christmas when I was closing up my laptop at 3am from playing sims he came out and got dressed telling me he was going to the store but eventually decided not to go. Pop also talked to his imaginary friend George. Now there’s another friend named Thomas 

Yesterday Aunt Crystal told me that pop was seeing dead people. He was seeing the deceased husband of grandmas sister Louise. She thinks he’s seeing people he liked but grandma told me he didn’t like Sal. Then he said, “they’re here” aunt crystal also wants to know who the “they” person is as well but believes that the spirits are trying to take pop however he keeps protesting.

I wonder what unfinished business he has left as it was already mine and grandmas bdays in November, thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years so what could be keeping him here? 

I don’t get why he’s still clinging: he’s clearly in tons of pain and miserable. Our state of New York doesn’t have legalized suicide yet which could’ve taken him out of his misery 

This morning At 4am a still awake me (hit my head on the dresser since aspergers affects my cerebellum and couldn’t fall asleep when I tried to at 12am) heard pop fighting with grandma. He had to go shit and grandma was trying to get him to go to the bathroom before he shit in the bed again (she cleans the sheets almost everyday as he bleeds very easily and of course shits in the bed since he’s like a baby now).

Grandma got my moms brother Uncle Jason to help her as he was getting ready for work in a few hours and they got pop to shit but he wouldn’t get off the toilet and walk back to bed to the point where grandma bad to threaten him with the ambulance. 

Today grandma took off from school bus driving to take care of pop.

Insight/advice?,5,e57mqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/e57mqi/insightadvice/,15,1575358194.0,"Hey all, new here. Been thinking about finding a caretaker sub for a while but have always felt a little guilty about airing my personal struggles online for people to look through. Today has just been a really tough day and could some insight/personal stories to help me process my thoughts. 

Background: 
My boyfriend and I have known each other for just over a year but have been officially together for about 9 months. About a month and a half into our relationship he was diagnosed with a mediastinal germ cell tumor. Immediately we began treatment which consisted of 8 hour days of BEP (cisplatin mix) at an infusion center an hour from home. Luckily, I am a high school teacher and summer had just begun so I was able to transport and be there for all of his infusions. 

After 3 cycles that spanned over all of summer vacation, we were transitioned to a new cocktail (TIP) that requires week-long in-patient treatment. 

Current status:
Currently, today’s scans show his AFP levels are excellent (2.7) but the mass of teratoma keeps growing, putting pressure on his heart and lungs. He sees a cardio thoracic surgeon in a couple days to see if it’s operable, but the oncologist isn’t optimistic. I won’t be there as I am out of vacation days, but his grandmother is flying in from out of state to be there with him. 

Since he has began treatment, he has lost over 60 lbs. and it seems to barely be stabilizing. He doesn’t eat hardly anything and refuses to try Ensure or similar meal replacement products. This is partly due to the normal loss of appetite attributed to chemo but also because of constipation as a side effect of his opioid pain killers. He had his last infusion about a month ago and his primary isn’t going to proceed with more. 

His energy levels are at an all time low; making the bed is enough to put him in bed for the rest of the day. Mostly, he watches tv or is on his phone and fades in and out of sleep all day. Because of this, his sleep pattern is all out of sync and he seems disinterested in almost everything. 

My struggle:
1. Diet. How can I help support him in eating better and taking in more fluids? We don’t have the longevity of a marriage or years behind us so I struggle with saying things like “do it for me.”  He does listen to me for most things but in this area he gets really stubborn. Also, the fear of a bowel movement is a strong hinderance for him to eat as some are so painful that they bring him to tears. 

2. Burnout. Despite seeing a therapist bimonthly, I am still struggling with caretaker burn out. There are times I want to get out of the house but I feel guilty for leaving him at home. We don’t live relatively near any friends or family that come visit with any sort of frequency. Also, things I want to do he shows enthusiasm for as well but then is exhausted after only having left the house for 30-45mins. I don’t want to disappoint him by telling him that I want to go out for longer than he’s going to have the energy for. 

3. Managing life while being supportive. He is active duty military so luckily he doesn’t have to deal with medical bills. That’s not to say that all the other expenses not covered by insurance aren’t overwhelming us. I work full-time as a HS teacher and moonlight as a server/bartender on the weekends. All of my teaching “sick days” I have used going to appointments and being there for him. I am exhausted 24/7 as I pick up as many extra hours at school as I can and work at least one day every weekend. Bills are getting covered but I feel like life is slowly slipping away from me as sometimes I don’t have the energy to do much else. I will continue to take as many days off of work as necessary to be by his side, but am worried how I can handle it all. 

Don’t get me wrong, I love him to death and will be by his side no matter what. I just needed to vent a little and am maybe hoping people are out there who went/are going through similar situations that they might be able to offer advice. Thank you!",2019-12-03 07:29:54

We've always struggled with division of emotional labour within our relationship. When he gets overwhelmed or upset, he shuts off. Whenever he shuts off, I'm left picking up the pieces by myself. He made some progress over the past year, but it was all the product of me *begging* him to address these behaviors.


Today, we got into another fight about a decision he'd made regarding something between us that I didn't agree with. We'd been fighting about it on and off since Saturday. Finally, I found out his reason for this decision, and it turns out that it's tied to something I did months ago that upset him. I didn't even know until today that it upset him. He never addressed it, so what could have been a 10 minute heart-to-heart over what I did the day or even week I did it turned into months of a grudge festering, and him trying to put rules on me that I did not find fair and eventually I just refused to agree to.


Despite all this, I love him dearly. We were otherwise doing well lately. His health has also taken a turn, but we were navigating it as best we could. I spent a lot of time fearing for his passing, but I was building up my own support system so as to not burden him with those fears since I knew he was already carrying fears of his own on that. I'm absolutely devastated that I won't be by his side if/when he does pass. I'm devastated to lose him. I could't carry the relationship on my own, though. I couldn't keep putting energy into conflicts that he was spending more energy trying to retaliate in than resolve. I couldn't keep cutting him slack due to his health. I couldn't take care of myself and him and us all at once.


I'm still going to miss the absolute shit out of him. I thought I'd be more relieved. I know I made the right choice, but I so desperately wish things could have gone differently. I love him, but for my sake I cannot be with him.",2019-11-08 11:22:57

My mom almost two months ago was given a month to live. I'm wondering if it's the end, I'd love some opinions.

Obviously for the past few months she has been getting weaker and weaker, she can still eat/drink/swallow, and even gets out of bed to go to the bathroom (with either a walker or wheelchair). Yesterday she had a good day, being wheeled around the house while my dad and I cleaned/decorated for her. Two nights ago she was confused in the middle of the night and was slurring her words, it got better in the morning, but it returned last night and has not left (it is now almost noon and still slurred words and confused). She still gets out of bed to use the bathroom and sits up in bed to eat cereal. 

Her cancer is in the brain and liver, and I know both brain mets and liver failure can cause delirium/slurred speech, but so can being in the last few days of life. It's so difficult that we don't know how much longer she has. Obviously the most I can do to try and figure out how much longer she has is to read stories from other people who have gone through this. I just hope that she is not in this state for several more weeks or months. I would hate to see that. 

Before her symptoms were controlled with meds she was confused as well but it quickly turned to being scared/paranoid. I don't mind if she is a ""happy confused"", asking me about my fishing trips (I don't fish) or about going on a limo ride (huh?). I just hate to see her suffer.",2019-09-09 00:43:22

I (21F) had a plan. I had a freaking plan! Stop taking care of the household, of my two brothers, my father, cleaning the entire house, and just focus on working more to help with the finances, move out with my mother and just take care of her.

I was ready to move. I was saving money. I am working nearly every day and than.. it happened. My father had an accident at work and can barely walk. His legs are completely swollen and he can't breathe through the pain. He just takes painkillers and tries to sleep. My mother can't breathe, her lungs are filled witg fluid once again, and she has to go to the hospital. 

I now have to take care of my household once again. He can't go to work and he doesn't want to go to the hospital right now. I can't move out, I have to stay arround and help. Idk anymore. Every time I take a step forward life knocks me down. I don't know anymore. I have to with my mother back to the hospital were we'll probably have to stay for a couple of days. I always go with her and stay with her to make her feel safe and because I help the nurses and her (with things like showering). But now my dad is telling me that he can't move and that he is going to need my help aswell. And I also have to work everyday to try to take care of everything. I feel like I can't breathe. 

My mother had some trouble sleeping these couple of days and I stayed up with her, and I'm just exhausted if life. I don't like this life. My whole body hurts. My way out, break of life, has been working out and last time I did that I fainted. I can't keep up with every thing. I even forget to eat, unless I'm working (cause than I atleast get a 30 minute break). 

I can't do this. I can't keep doing this. I've been slacking at home and I've been slacking at work and at everything in my life. I feel like I'm going crazy. All day I'm smiling at customers, while inside I'm breaking down. I can't do this. I've had a conversation with my therapist about it and he said that I had to talk to my mother about it all to see if she really did expect me to work, go to school, go to my internship, go to appointments at the hospitals, financially take care of the house, clean and cook and all of that. And I did. She does expect me to do most of it. She tells me that I don't have to go to the hospital if it's to much, but how can I not go to the hospital?

She's fucking dying, this is her last possible treatment. She's dying. The doctor said that I'd be lucky if had her for one or two more years. How can I just not go to the hospital when every day could be her last? How can I focus on class when she's dying at the hospital? It's not realistic. And that's the only thing that she doesn't expect from me. The rest I should do. Idk. She's also reached a point were she tells me how badly she wants to go. To just end it all. Wtf am I supposed to do? I can't breathe.

Ofcourse she's depressed the only time she leaves the house is to go to the hospital. What kind of life is that? She also doesn't want/isn't able to leave the hospital if she's not in a wheelchair, because she reached the point that she can't walk more than a couple of steps before not being able to breathe. She doesn't want a wheelchair though. And my dad doesn't want to go to the hospital. And both need to be cared for. I'm trying to not care for my piece of shit brothers (23 and 20) who refuse to help out in the house, financially or my parents. My brother doesn't want to bring my dad to the hospital. I have to. After I make breakfast, clean the house, and work an 8 hour shift, I'll have to bring him to the hospital. Than go back home to get my mother and bring her to her hospital, I'll have to somehow travel 45 minutes back to his hospital (idk why they don't go to the same one), bring him home, make dinner, go to her, sleep there (?) And get ready to go to work again. 

I don't know anymore. My mental health is already a fucking mess, but I guess that it's just all dumb. Life is stupid. It gives you people to love and than threatens to take them from you, not offering you a cure. and as the person you love more than life is fading away right infornt of you, you see the people who they loved become self involved monsters who only care for themselves. There aren't many good people, and all their friends get sick and tirwd of seeing your loved one being sick and tired. It happens to often so they call less and less, barely visir, apologize and say that life took over. And it did. Because they still have their life. But the truth is that the people who see their loved one die and care for that person are dying to. Every second they see them in pain, they're hurting. Every  sedond the person dies more inside, it feels like they're dying. But they're not. They're life goes on. They still have work and school and bills and people they know and will get to know. As THEY are dying, they also have to live. Life goes on, and you're expected to go on, strong. You've been strong for so long, when will you drop all the weight? 

When will you stop dying along their side and live your life? Will you ever stop dying along their side and just live your life? She's my meaning. My reason to keep going. My reason to breathe. Don't make others your reason. I made her mine, but now she's running out of time and I need another reason. She has other reasons. Why couldn't her cancer be mine. That makes me selfish. I want to take her cancer pain, but it will replace her pain with the pain of losing a daughter. I'm selfish, I'm still young I could fight her cancer better. I am physically strongee than her. I wouldn't mind being there instead of her. Because life would stop. I don't mind if life just stopped. 

I'm selfish and I know that it would hurt a lot less for me to lose myself than to lose my mother. I know my mother, I don't know myself. I love my mother more than I could ever love myself. I would just fight for her. And she'd be by my side and I'd be alright because she'd be by my side.

This is killing me and I selfishly want to die before she does cause I'm so tired. 
I'm tired of life everyone in my life. I'm tired of fake smiling and taking carw of everything and everyone. I'm tired of working everyday and barely sleeping and feeling sick and hospitals. I'm tired of the sound oh her coughing desperately trying to breathe. I'm  tired of hearing and seeing the changes in her as her lungs fill up. I'm just tired of fighting and trying to be strong. I'm tired of crying and trying not to cry. I'm tired if everyone at work finding out that she's sick and them looking at me with pity. I'm tired of not recognizing the woman who have birth to me. She may still be alive, but the cancer killed her. It killed her smile, her joy, her innocence in the way she looked at the people she cared about, it killed her love for life. And she told me she doesn't want to fight death when it comes for her. 

I can't talk to my immediate family cause no one is there for her, no one seems to care or accept her reality. I can't talk to my extended family, because part of them just shout at me that I should get married, because than she can see me get married before she dies. The other part cares about her so much, that she told me to lie to them about how she's doing. So I'm alone. She's not with me anymore. Her cancer is all she can think about, it has consumed her. How could it not when it took her hair, than her energy, her ability to breathe normally and her ability to walk more than a few steps.
Every thing about her screems cancer. 

So I just go to work and take care if every thing and every one. 

You know what I'll say it. I'm mad at the world right now. I never thought the world owed me anything but fuck it. I'm mad at the world. I'm mad at by brother's for being bad people and hurting my mother and not helping and being selfish! I'm mad at my dad for acting like everything's fine and ignoring the fact that my mother has cancer and ia dying! I'm mad at my father because he'll never choose my side and if he had raised men instead of little boys thinga would've been different. I'm mad at my father because I warned him about my little brother and told him many times that he is never going to get an education and he's going to.hang out with the wrong people and get himself in some trouble with the law, and he didn't believe me. And now my little brother has been dropping out of schools like it's his job, when he doesn't have a job he steals money from us or sells out stuff. He owes the government and his ex schools a lot of money and he's getting worse. I'm mad at the doctors for telling us her cancer was gone and than later telling us that it wasn't gone and that it has spread and became worse. I'm mad at the doctors of ignoring her pain and claiming that it was a side effect. I'm mad at myself for believing and trusting in them because they're doctors. I'm mad at my personal trainer who told me that I was just trying to make my mother's illness about myself. I'm mad at the people who come visit my mother without telling us first and than expecting me to serve them drinks and foods the whole time that they're here. I'm mad at cancer for being cancer. I'm mad at life for sucking. I'm just mad. I'm also just mad cause I'm sad. I'm also mad because every time I cry I get a migraine, which is like life telling me ""oh you're sad, here bow now you're also in more pain! You're welcome!""

I'm mad at myself for complaining, cause there are people out there dying. But than I also remember that so is my mother so that makes a little sense. I just wanted to get that off my chest and be a little bi*ch just being mad and sad and upset.

things have been snowballing, been doing so much paperwork and appointments with his doctors, oncologist and military. keeping everything organised, trying to find a place close to his family for the move, and spending five weeks in the hospital.

I have been getting more angry and agitated at the universe, because things are getting a bit much. I should be spending my time being with him, be his wife than being his personal assistant, keeping everything in line. I am his caregiver and I would give him the world to make him healthy. 

But I just want to break down and cry.  I don't because if I do I won't stop, I don't want him to see this. I know he can feel it. 

He had a sever allergic reaction on his second line of chemo that he has been on for months. The doctors here were very thorough on making sure he was okay.

Watching my dad lay in a bed and slowly die for the last 6 months is the worst way a person can go out. I have always believed in natural treatments and prevention and have always disagreed with western medicine and their practices. It looks like my dad is literally in hell and I just don’t know how long a human should do this. It seems like cruel and unusual punishment to me. They’re saying even if everything goes 100% perfect and he does get better, recovery could be 2 years only to provide him another 3 years tops. Plus some of the issues he is dealing with could be permanent so he is just trading in one sickness for another. Is this worth it!?! Maybe something is wrong with my brain and my perspective, but imagining him going through this for the next few years just does not click in my head.

Maybe this is the way I was raised or my family dynamic, I don’t know. I just want to be clear headed and a good person, but my family has never been close. My dad has been single and living alone for a very long time so all he has is the damaged relationships with my brothers and myself. All three of us are there as often as possible and I quit my job to be his full time caregiver... but I can’t do this job for YEARS. This is AWFUL!!!!! Every day is awful and of course even more awful for my poor father. Does the fact that I’m not willing to sacrifice years of my life make me a bad person?

"Dad has cancer, mom is getting frustrated. Not sure what my place is.",7,bxfyrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/bxfyrs/dad_has_cancer_mom_is_getting_frustrated_not_sure/,11,1559851651.0,"Hello. I’m glad I found this sub, I could use some advice or other points of view. 

My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 throat cancer 5 years ago. After chemo and radiation, he was cancer free for 5 years. (The radiation on his throat was really tough, he tolerated chemo well. ) Cancer returned in his lung this spring. Chemo really hit him hard this time around. Terrible nausea, fatigued and out of breath. He’s 67. He’s always been positive and wants to live. 

My 71 year old mom is his caretaker. On top of that, she works part time from home, watches my niece (2.5) and nephew (4months) 20-30 hours a week and takes care of house. She rarely accepts any help or gets upset if you just do something helpful. 

Their relationship has always had tension. Mom is more critical/withholding, while my dad is more emotional/sensitive. He’s been on antidepressants for 20+ years, my mom has untreated anxiety issues. I love them both, but have a closer relationship with my dad. He’s been a constant support, especially with my own depression and anxiety. I have an older sister, we have our own issues but are able to put them aside, to help our parents. She takes after my mom and expressed she’s mad at my dad because he wasn’t eating and ‘every time she tries to help it bites her in the ass’. 

The recent chemo worked to keep cancer at bay for now, but more will be needed in the future. Last week he was very nauseous, fatigued and short of breath, last chemo treatment was a month ago. He was complaining every tasted bad, ate little to nothing and slept a lot. Because of some insurance/doctor issue, he’s been off one of his antidepressants for a week. I gave him a daily pep talk, he wanted to eat, but felt something was just not right. I suggested mom call his doctor. I’m not sure if she did or not. She kept saying his last blood work came back fine and it was all mental, that he’s doing this to himself, telling him this frequently. Saturday morning she finally had enough and we took him to the ER. When my dad was talking to the doctor, she was rolling her eyes and chiming in and telling the doctor he just needs a psych consult. I had to step out of the room because of the tension. In the hallway, the doctor told me her concerns about their situation and that my mom was burnt out, I agreed. I finally was able to convince her to go home and nap. 

My dads tests results came back, his hemoglobin and white cells were extremely low and needed a blood transfusion. Ultimately he needed 4 units of blood. They also found a few stomach ulcers. Both the ER and hospitalist/inpatient doctor highly recommended palliative care for extra support, or at least family therapy. My mom doesn’t see the need and was upset it was suggested. My dad was in favor of it. After 4 days in the hospital, he’s home and feeling kind of better. He understands he needs to eat. My mom was upset he only ate 1/2 of the 3 egg omelet she made. Her getting upset makes my dad feel guilty. They rarely speak or spend time together. 

I bought up the suggestion of palliative care to her yesterday, explaining what services/support it can offer. That just upset her and she exasperated “fine, if you and your dad think it would help, just do it, but I don’t see the need.” I know she stressed, frustrated and growing resentful. All understandable given her position. My sister seems annoyed by all of this and thinks my dad just needs to try harder. (I agree with that, but know getting upset with someone isn’t a great motivator.) 

I left a message with the oncology social worker about palliative care yesterday. 

I’m frustrated and not sure what my place in my family or caregiving is. I want my dad to get the care he needs (medically and emotionally) but me getting involved only seems to cause more friction with my mom and sister. I don’t think she realizes it, but it seems slightly abusive. I’m really concerned about both of them.

Update (6/12/19)
Dad is still loosing weight, having difficult time eating and has been vomiting/diarrhea for the past 4 days. He’s very anxious and feels he’s disappointing us by not eating more. When I saw him yesterday, he admitted to me that living with my mom is causing a lot of stress and he tries not to tell her too much because she’ll get upset. I asked him to share a few things with my mom while I was there and she wouldn’t have it, “you’ve said that before and I’m done talking in circles about it.” 

He was planning on going back to his part time job today, because he doesn’t want to upset my mom. Yet he didn’t want to sit outside with me yesterday because he felt too weak to walkout there (< 20ft away). I asked him how he plans to go to work if he can’t make it outside. He’s afraid to do a lot of things because it would upset my mom and told me “you should hear what she says when no one is around.” I just sat with him, hoping to help him calm down. I tried to show him some breathing exercises, tried to distract him with stories or things he’s interested in, showed him photos or funny videos, things to look forward to, etc. Worked for a little while, but he’d bring the convo back to his situation quickly. I find medication videos helpful for my anxiety, so I suggested we listen to a short one, he refused to try it, saying “I just enjoy talking with you, I can’t talk like this to your mom or sister.” I appreciate and understand why, but it’s frustrating. I can’t be his only emotional support system, especially when he tells me about their marriage or how my mom and sister treat him. I’ve explained it puts me in an awkward position and makes me upset with mom and sister. That doesn’t help anything. 

Anyway, While I was visiting, I reviewed his meds and gained access to his online chart/health info. My mom is trying to stay organized, has print outs to track meds, food, vitals and notes. Good!!However, She keeps his meds hidden (won’t tell us where they are), dad isn’t aware of what he’s taking and I found some discrepancies in his meds from what my mom has been saying. She’s still been giving him low dose aspirin while he’s recovering from stomach ulcers. (She was not present to hear the doctor say not to, as she just waited in the car outside when he was being discharged and dad forgot his folder with discharge papers and info from dietitian.) She did call, hospital offered to print copies, but she decided they weren’t important. I get this is a lot. For anyone. 

He saw his primary care doc yesterday for follow up care for ulcers and help with eating. He was really hoping for an appetite stimulate, feeding tube or just to be admitted again. Doctor wanted blood work and took a stool sample for testing. While leaving the dr’s office, he got weak, vomited and had diarrhea, they sent him to the ER. He was sent home after blood work came back normal (hemoglobin was at 9, which seems low to me?) and took another stool sample. 

After I spoke with the social worker last week, I explained how they can help. My mom reached out to her (so did my dad, without either one of them aware they each called). But he’s got an appointment with a palliative care doctor next week! So that’s good news. I’ve also been in contact with a local non profit that offers counseling to cancer patients/families. 

In addition to all this,  it’s really hard for me to see my dad. The chemo transformed him into a sick old man. He doesn’t look like the dad I remember from even a year ago. When I was like young he worked in this loft above retail space. It was 2 flights of stairs, no landings or turns, just straight stairs. It seemed like he flew up those stairs. He’d run up and down them so quick, it seemed like he was flying. I tried so hard to keep up with him. Even now, 30 years later, I rush up stairs as if I’m Indiana Jones fleeing from a crumbling temple. 

I have a good support system but when I do socialize, I don’t want to discuss it much. Which is hard, because a lot of people ask. My dads passion in life has been sailing, mostly racing. He was a sail maker, coach, and very involved with it for 50+ years. We didn’t have a boat and I didn’t become interested in it until I was 20. He showed me the basics and told me to go sail with other people and find my own way. So I did. I didn’t tell people I was his daughter until they figured it out. I’ve made great friends and have adult relationships with my parents friends that knew me as a kid. This sounds awful, because I appreciate the concern and care, but it’s hard to have several people asking about him when I’m in my ‘happy place’ and trying to relax. It’s hard to keep retelling the updates or stories. 

Ok, I should stop. There’s more I could go on about but this is long enough.",2019-06-06 20:07:31
VENT Caregiving has caused me to hate my father,6,brq41k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/brq41k/vent_caregiving_has_caused_me_to_hate_my_father/,5,1558567485.0,"I already did some research online so my guilt for feeling this way has been helped. My father is the most difficult patient. When we go to the visits, he is the one causing a scene, being as asshole to everyone. He refusing the advice of the doctors, can't and won't take all his meds, and won't do any treatments that require him to go back to the hospital. I already know, being his daughter, that he is a narcissist. Since the caregiving jumped from part-time to full-time, I have really got to spend time with him and I thought it would be a good thing to get to know each other better since we haven't always been a close family. HUGE MISTAKE. I hate him to the core. His beliefs, morals, ethics, ideas about life and society. He is literally everything I hate in a human being and I believe this is why I left home when I was 17 and never went back. I'm 30 now and suffer from BPD and PTSD from my childhood. 

&#x200B;

I've always been so above and beyond with my help because it makes me feel good and acts of service is my love language. The problem is, with the way he is treating me and the rest of the world, I am now disgusted by this person. I don't want to be around him at all, let alone go above and beyond. Everything is difficult. Drinking water is a fight with him. This is causing me to now do the bare minimum. I literally just want to leave his food and medications on his night stand and be away as much as I can. I don't want to make my soups from scratch, I don't want to massage his legs, I don't want to just sit here and comfort him because every second of being with him is awful.  I understand he is in pain. I've been here since the beginning. I've been working hard on my compassion, empathy, and putting myself in his shoes to help me continue. This helps temporarily get me into the kind, generous mindset. I'll take a break and go to the gym and mediate, but as soon as I walk back in that door and he pisses me off, I'm back to anger. 

Whenever we try and show him proof that we need to talk care of our own health and mental health by taking a break and going to the gym, or going on a hike he says things like... your job isn't hard, IM the sick one, this is only hard for me. Or he tries to guilt trip me for leaving for 1 hour to go to the gym.. things like.. do you think this is a good idea? You better think about this before you leave? Fine I'll just die here. 

&#x200B;

I understand I sound like the asshole now but I don't care what you think, you're not here, you're not dealing with him. For those of you that are/have dealt with someone like this.. what do you do? I know this is common because I've read a few other stories.",2019-05-22 23:24:45

Do you have ways of coping?,6,atmh4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/atmh4h/do_you_have_ways_of_coping/,7,1550896539.0,"Bit of back story, my dad was diagnosed with myeloma 13 years ago, eventually he died of bowel cancer 17 months ago. My mum was diagnosed with breast cancer 10 years ago, fortunately they caught it quickly, she had an op and that was that. Last Thursday mum was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). I am an only child with no other family members around for support. So I'm having to take time off from work at the mo whilst she's in hospital recovering from an op to have a stent fitted. She had a biopsy of her liver which we haven't had the results back yet but I understand prognosis for this type of cancer isn't great (to say the least). 

My friends have been really good recently and I know I cannot always rely on them, but today I'm really down and no one is free, I've drank almost a bottle of wine to myself and I wish I hadn't, but also it's given me an opportunity for the first time since mum's most recent diagnosis to cry, which can only be a cathartic thing. 

I just wondered what everyone else does to cope? I should add I'm not at all reliant on alcohol, but maybe once a week I'll indulge in some wine, usually it's every two weeks. 

Mum was always sole carer for my dad, but now the responsibility is on me for mum, and I always feel like I have to maintain this ""strong"" persona. I also have a 6 year old that lives with her dad (because of my lack of family support when my dad was dying) and her dad and my ex-MIL have been really good about it all (we aren't together anymore) but I've not been able to see her like I normally would whilst mum has been in hospital which has made me feel such guilt, which doesn't help. Add to that the guilt of me not being able to work for the last week or so. I feel like I'm living a nightmare. 

Also perhaps I should mention that I have never quite gotten over the death of my dad, it still gives me nightmares and some things have happened in caring for my mum that have triggered me and taken me back to that time. So I'm not really sure how to deal with that going forward. 

Should say I'm in the UK. But yeah, how did you all manage to look after yourselves? Sorry if I'm rambling. ",2019-02-23 04:35:39
How to Tell My Dad That The Social Worker Wants Me To Be The Main Caregiver,5,af4u63,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/af4u63/how_to_tell_my_dad_that_the_social_worker_wants/,3,1547303615.0,"So my Mom has Leukemia and is going to receive a bone marrow transplant mid-February. My dad is on the autism spectrum and their marriage hasn't always been the strongest either because my dad tends to get overwhelmed when there is negative emotion in the area and he reacts dramatically to it. We had a family meeting that went poorly because my mom was having troubles with her port and was irritable because of it. After this, my dad texted my mother saying that he didn't want to be her caregiver and that he wanted to hire one. This is when I offered to be the caregiver if my dad drops out. He calmed down after a couple of days and is now assuming that he will be in charge. During winter break, I've been the one taking my mom to all of her appointments, and because of my dad's declaration, we talked to a social worker during one of these appointments about our options. The social worker said that it would be best if I took the semester off -I'm in college- and was the primary caretaker. I have no idea how to bring this up to my dad who reacts really badly to basically any negative news. We had the conversation with the social worker three days ago and I am clueless as to how to broach this to minimize the damage. I'm totally fine taking on the caregiver role. I'm a little bummed to be missing the semester because I have a lot of friends who are seniors and that means missing time with them, but my mom's health is ultimately more important. I just don't know how to bring this up to my dad. ",2019-01-12 14:33:35

My dad has stage 4 cancer and we recently found out that there is no cure anymore and that chemo may just make him feel worse. He has decided he wants to stop all treatment and wants to go home to spend his last moments with family and die at his house. I’ve been the main person taking care of him and it’s really hard for me but I know I have to respect his wishes. I let him know I support him with anything he chooses even if I don’t agree. 

I had him living with me for about week and a half to two weeks before I brought him to the hospital. These past night have been hard because we were staying in the same room. We were both sleeping on I think twin beds. It’s weird going to sleep and waking up not seeing him there. He is currently at the hospital. Today at 7 he is going to be discharged. 

He has a porta cath put in for no reason. We didn’t even get to start chemo. The biopsy was done after the porta cath, so we didn’t know how bad his cancer was until after the porta cath was put in. 

His cancer advanced so fast. I don’t think he will be with us for a long time. I just hope he doesn’t suffer a lot. 

I’m trying to spend a lot of time with him but I just came back to work (I work at a school). And I’m also a student at a university and don’t know if I’ll be able to finish my program. 

Please pray that he doesn’t suffer any more than he already is. That he is happy his last days. He’s in a lot of pain he isn’t even afraid anymore. ",2018-08-09 07:48:44

So labs have for the most part been abnormal. High wbc, ammonia, potassium and I don’t remember what else. Turns out he is going to be admitted. I’m usually able to act real strong in front of him but he did this one thing that just made me cry. I was sitting next to his hospital bed with my head resting on the rail. I had my eyes closed. I feel him move and i open my eyes and see his big yellow (jaundice) eyes looking at me. He turns away quickly pretending not to look at me. I let him know I’m here.

My siblings are all busy and abroad but it's unlikely they will partake in the caregiving of my mum. I have been overseeing my mum's well being these few days and it's really tiring. 

I have depression myself; I stopped working with the intention of figuring out my own life, but to my exasperation god decided to drop this bomb on us. I feel I have to do everything to make sure everything is ok; my friends cannot be of any emotional support to me, neither can my father; I have to be that emotional support for everybody instead.

And I was so stressed out that I have to resort to talking to inanimate objects to let go of some of the stress. Honestly I don't think I can make it alone, I had classes to attend and I spent a huge amount on the deposit; it's my dream and all I ever wanted to be. But I felt I had to give up on that and even without the stress of the classes I don't think I can make it through this.

I need support yet I can't find any. I had my own share of problems and I'm already struggling with it; only recently mum has become my only beacon of hope with the promise of trying to making me feel secure about my ""recovery"" and ""goals"" but all of that is shattered. They still continue to lie to me that I am going to be fine and I don't have to worry about this situation, but with my dad not really thinking through properly and my mum not yet knowing the diagnosis, I find this is it; I have to be the sole caretaker. I'd love to. It's not about me losing my dreams. It's about that I can't get any support and sometimes I am going crazy

I feel friends are useless, they don't reply upon my news. I just suddenly realised how alone I already am.

I have to be strong but I have no idea how. I know I have to be but this is just too much and my body is already taking the toll. I need to be healthy, strong, stable and positive for my mum and yet nobody can provide any kind of that support to me it's ridiculous!

Sorry for the rant. I am thankful for any feedback.

Edit: I have been her caregiver (with my dad) for 2 days, I am adapting fast and well, then I realised I really have no one to turn to. My mum is post operative hysterectomy; the cancer is discovered upon surgery, she doesn't know she has cancer and being more medically inclined I have been the person receiving the blunt end of the news. I'm so tired holding it all the details(diagnosis, caregiving, life,)  alone.",2018-07-08 03:25:41

There are days when he can’t grab onto things because he can’t feel them. It breaks my heart to hear he’s in pain and there’s little I can do. His oncologist says it can take years for those side effects to go away. My dad is self employed and it’s hard for him to work when he can’t feel his hands and his legs are giving out. Of course, this leads to financial stress. He has other people helping him but not nearly as experienced as him.

Today we find out that after the tremendous progress he’s made through chemo, his tumor marker has gone up again. They’re ordering more blood work and CT scans and I’m afraid of what they’ll find.

how do you address/handle the guilt associated with changes in lifestyle/plans for a loved one battle cancer?,6,89buno,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/89buno/how_do_you_addresshandle_the_guilt_associated/,12,1522776085.0,"
Hi there! I have found out recently...well, the family found out, that our beloved mother is fighting stage 4 breast cancer that has spread to her pancreas and liver. The degree in which it is spread, I can't say I understood everything I was told as my older brother and dad are the dedicated medical info repeaters to keep our extended fam in the loop. This diagnosis came last week, though my mom had been going through some tests a few weeks before and I sensed something could be wrong.

Long story short, there are a lot of feelings in the air from everyone. Me, particularly, am the only sibling that lives outside of our home state of California. I grew up there but moved to NYC two years ago. I am currently not working , as I took time off to travel and live off of savings, but the topic has been approached of me moving back to help out as my older siblings have families of their own (though we've all been helping out with emotional support - esp grand kids keep my mom happy!). Me, on the other hand, I am a solo bird. No family of my own, youngest child growing up in the family, all that. 

I'm so saddened by this news of the cancer. What's worse is my mom feels guilty for making a ""burden"". In fact, the day before she officially found out, I had booked a multi continent solo trip and she insisted I still continue or else it would upset her if I changed my plans. This breaks my heart. Even at her worst, she puts others before herself.

A part of me thinks moving back home will help out. But a part of me is mourning also the loss of this life I built in New York City. Please excuse me for sounding petty and childish, perhaps even insensitive. I don't dare share these feelings outloud with the family but they are feelings I can't seem to get rid of. I feel like the ""right"" thing to do is to move. I'm in between jobs, and I've lived most of my life back in Cali so adjusting to life back there wouldn't be a problem. But on top of feeling sad for my mom, and my dad, and our family, I am feeling guilty FOR feeling sad to leave New York City.

My siblings having their own families, something that is ""theirs"". For me, i've never really had much I could call my own except for decisions and a life I've carved out for myself, esp starting over in NYC. Super cliche I know.

I feel extremely guilty for not wanting to leave NYC. And then I go into cycles where I wonder if things like that even matter. I should drop everything for the woman who raised our family, who never thinks twice to put her children ahead before herself. 

This may be more of a vent but feedback is appreciated. You can say I am selfish too, maybe that's it? Or is this disease simply the catalyst of an unplanned journey for everyone involved? Maybe these feelings are OK? I feel like I am mourning the loss of my mom, and our normal life as we know it. Our plans (collectively as a family and also individually, i.e. my parents living it up retirement lifestyle).

He said if it does come back cancerous, he doesn’t want to go through chemo or any of that. He just doesn’t feel good. I think it broke my heart when he said he’s DNR.

This is Hell,6,7rwncx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/7rwncx/this_is_hell/,5,1516552275.0,"Must be my third rant/post in here.

There’s not really much to say. My mother’s cancer is squeezing her intestines. She has a literal knot in her stomach that prevents her from eating more than a bit a day, if that. She can’t even drink. We’re lucky she’s doing any of it.

My sister and I had a much-needed yelling match. I’m ashamed to admit I hit her, but it got her to finally be honest about this whole situation, instead of screaming and yelling about stupid shit like moving the guitar chord rolls she hasn’t used in 10 years.

As stupid as it is... I can’t help but feel like we are responsible for Mum’s deteriorating health. I don’t know how much to push her to eat. Sister arguably pushes too much. Stepdad is there to help lift her and carry her, but Mum weighs so little now that I feel like I could carry her with my bad shoulder. She’s under 100 lbs. She’s basically a skeleton. The hospitals don’t do anything when we admit her, and the nurses she sees that administer chemo just say “you need to feed her more.”

We are trying. They aren’t there when she throws up from “overeating.” They aren’t watching her wither away. They aren’t there when she’s in a half-awake daze because due to starvation and a drug-induced stupor. Take off the drugs, and she’s in scream-induced agony — that after two years someone FINALLY admitted “yes, that’s the cancer causing that.” 

No one has said “There’s no hope.” No one has said “It’s terminal.” But I honest to gods wish someone would, so my mother could have at least had the option to die with her dignity in tact. She never wanted to go out like this.

Edit 1/23/2018: This entire post is a moot point, as I sit in a hospital now watching her die of septic shock.

Self Introduction,5,7anhuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/7anhuk/self_introduction/,7,1509783668.0,"Hi everyone,

My fiancee was recently diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer. I'm an American, she is Chinese, and we are currently living in China. It's been especially hard because I have to ask her what the doctor tells her, or wait to get translations of the tests back to really know what's going on. I can't ask the doctor questions directly.

It's been about 2 and a half weeks since her diagnosis. She's doing IV Cancer treatment (not sure what to call it) and she's done one session so far. The Doc initially told her once every two weeks, but pushed it to 3 since her WBC is too low (it's back up after some injections).

I am really hoping people can suggest two things for me.
1) She doesn't have many hobbies other than watching TV. Her work took up most of her time prior to the diagnosis, but now she's not working and doesn't know what to do with herself. Can anyone suggest some hobbies for her to try?
2) She is feeling trapped in the apartment. Her mom just wants her to rest and stay inside. As long as WBC is up, what are some things she can do?

Thank you all",2017-11-04 08:21:08

She's emotionally drained and very short tempered. I walked in and she was in hysterics that my dad was ignoring her and what would have happened if she had something seriously wrong. I calmed her down and sat with her for a long time. 

A little about my situation, I'm 33 and married. My husband and I were living in California when my mom was diagnosed with Stage III cancer. She had her first treatment on that bout at the end of May, 2014 and we had moved back by July. We literally live with my parents, which is trying in itself. But necessary to help take care of her. 

She was originally told she would never get rid of her cancer, but they could make it smaller and less invasive. Well, the chemo/radiation got rid of it outside of the lung and only a 1cm nodule was left In her lung. About a year later, the nodule had grown a cm in a very short time. She was face to face with all of this again, but this time her doctor said it was operable. So they removed half her left lung robotically. She was in the hospital 4 days and then home with minimal pain. It was miraculous!

But now we are back to chemo. I cried with her today and told her I wish it were me. She of course said she wouldn't want that, but I just hate seeing her going through all this again. It sucks. 

She will be doing chemo every Thursday. For 2 weeks she'll do a long day (2 hours of fluids, 4 hours of chemo and 2 more hours of fluids) along with her 10 minute other chemo. Then the other 2 weeks she will only do the 10 minute chemo. I don't know the names of the drugs but I know one of them has a high level of metal in it, hence the fluid flush.

I’m writing to ask for some advice. My mom was recently diagnosed with a stage iv blood cancer and I have my first baby and her first grandchild due any day now.

My dad, husband, and brother are also pillars of support for my mom and dedicate their time and effort to getting my mom better too. My mom is tough and doesn’t need me constantly hovering but I know she loves the company and it, selfishly, breaks my heart whenever I’m not with her during this time. 

I am worried however about balancing a newborn and giving my mom all the support that she deserves.

With that being said I plan to spend most of my maternity leave at my mom’s with the baby (with the oncologist’s ok and instructions for my mom to wear a mask when she holds the baby) but I still get worried about the little germs babies carry compromising my mom’s health.

My husband was diagnosed with cancer of the bowel and metastatic liver cancer 2 and a half years ago. He was told it was stage 4. His treating team were able to remove the bowel cancer shortly after his diagnosis. (He's also got two or three other issues, but cancer is the most serious of his health problems). 

I'm down as his next of kin. The only blood relatives he has in this country are two nieces (and their children) and a nephew that aren't close to us. The three know of his illness as I told them as soon ad he got diagnosed. But they're unwilling to help out. I've not got anyone out of my family I can really turn to as they all live overseas. So I've been pretty much it for him. 

He was told he had two years to live when he was first diagnosed. Since then he has been undergoing chemo. About five weeks ago he underwent SIRT sphere therapy. 

I noticed a bit of a change in him over the last year or so...he's generally refusing to give me any proper updates in regards to what's happening with his treatments other than ""one day the chemo will stop working and I'll die"".

She hadn’t woken up for her appointment, so I got her up and she started rushing to make it. Her breathing got bad, but she was going to the doctor and I figured she would be okay.

I get a message from her that they’re sending her to the ER. She didn’t mention the ambulance until I called her.

At the ER, they do the CT scan and that’s the first time we hear it. A mass. She also has blood clots, a lot of them, small and in her lungs. Fast forward a week and she’s had a bronchoscopy. The pulmonologist confirms that it looks like NSC cancer. The biopsy results will be back Thursday/Friday.

My Mom Still Has Cancer,4,epehhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/epehhl/my_mom_still_has_cancer/,2,1579178948.0,"Original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/bspgyh/my\_mom\_has\_cancer/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/bspgyh/my_mom_has_cancer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

It's been over six months since my mom was diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer (metastasis to both lungs, ovaries, and liver). She has been doing chemotherapy every two weeks and last week was her first CT scan (there were a few more in-between, but it was during a hospitalization). Unfortunately, her colon tumors have gotten bigger, which my mom figured out on her own due to increasing pain.

The pain, the nausea, the hair loss, the fatigue... it would be worth it if the treatment plan was working, yanno? But it isn't. My mom and I cried for a bit, talked about it, and decided to go full steam ahead into the next game plan. Her chemo has been switched and I can only cross my fingers and hope it works.

She hasn't been working and she feels guilty. She tells me all the time how useless she is around the house. I tell her she isn't, her only job is to focus on herself and to get better. She's the best person I know and if she could do more, I know she would. She misses her friends from work and having a routine. Work is the one place that keeps me sane and I can only imagine how much I would miss it if I couldn't do it anymore.

I had so much anger when I made my original post. It's still there, but the anger is directed towards the universe's indifference towards my mom. In the spirit of that indifference, I've accepted my role as a primary caregiver and I advocate for my mom wherever and whenever I can. If the universe won't help my mom, I sure as hell can.

There are very few things I'm thankful to my mom's cancer for, but in the spirit of looking on the bright side, here they are:

\- I've been learning how to cook. Nothing fancy, usually spaghetti or salads, but enough to make sure my mom and sister are well fed.

\- I've learned a lot from my mom. I'm now a pro at changing ostomy bags. It'll definitely help my healthcare career. (I'm staying the fuck away from oncology.)

\- My family dynamic has changed. We're all a little more put together. My family, her brothers and sisters, have been a blessing. They bring her breakfast and lunch from time to time while I'm at work or they clean around the house. My aunt even took my mom's laundry because I couldn't get to it. My uncle will come over and order pizza so I don't have to cook. My mom and I say I love you a lot more to each other. My sister has been seeing a therapist and she's become a lot more open with my mom and I.

\- I've taken my health seriously. I've been eating better whenever I can... little things like fruits instead of chips and less meat, more seafood or meat alternatives. I signed up for the gym (I've only gone a handful of times, but hey, I'm trying). I take daily vitamins. I know there's nothing I can do about genetics, but if I can try to reduce my risk, why shouldn't I?

Would I say these good things have been worth my mom's emotional and physical turmoil? Absolutely not, \*but\* it is the hand she and I were dealt with and we're making the best of it.

Whenever I need a good cry, I'll listen to Taylor Swift's ""Soon You'll Get Better."" I didn't realize the song was about her mom battling cancer until after I initially listened to it. There's one particular line that gets me every time and I know despite her millions of dollars, she's desperate, like us all, to make our loved ones better:

""Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too.""

Thank you for reading. Good luck.",2020-01-16 12:49:08

Being in denial and refusing help,5,eea5fy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/eea5fy/being_in_denial_and_refusing_help/,1,1577076813.0,"My dad was diagnosed two months ago with stage 4 metastatic lung cancer that has spread to his prostate and bones. He has refused to get chemo that would extend his life only another year or two. That is fine and I respect that decision. So his life expectancy is under a year. 

I can tell he is taking a turn, as he is now complaining of some diffuse pain, his cough is constant, and he has a slight wheeze. My dad has always been a busy body, and luckily I think that is helping him on a functional level, but my family that lives closer to him tell me he’s starting to go to bed a little earlier, or stay in bed a little longer. He’s getting more exhausted with doing some stuff around the house. He’s very small too, and is only around 120 pounds. He has little appetite and is looking more and more like “skin and bones”.

My dad is being very stubborn about seeking help. As someone who isn’t seeking treatment, I spoke to his oncology nurse navigator about what his options even are as his disease progresses. She said that at his last visit they did try to refer him to palliative care to get the supportive care he needs, but she said he refused.

Since learning that, I have tried to broach the subject and educate him on what palliative care could help with, but he still refuses. I think he sees it as giving in, or not being “tough”, or perhaps that it means things are getting close. I can’t get him to understand it. 

So my question is less about what to do to convince him, but more on what do I and the other family members do if he literally declines further and passes away? I am his healthcare proxy and I have no problem signing him up with hospice and palliative care if he loses the ability to decide for himself. But I’m terrified of what to do if he remains mentally sharp, goes “out fighting”, and passes in his sleep at home. 

He has not planned for anything and he won’t. I have told him I can help with those things, but he’s in such deep denial that I don’t know what to do and I can’t force him. He’s not planning financially, he’s not planning for what happens after his death. He has told me he wishes to be cremated, but how do we even handle that if he passes with no plans? 

I know this is such a morbid post and question, but knowing my dad is going to do what he wants, I’m not sure what I do if I get a call that he’s gone. Who do I call? Who would come pick him up? With his recent turn and looking more sickly, I am worried that this is going to all happen in the next couple months. This is awful, I am sad he’s being overly stoic about it, I am sad he’s refusing to address his symptoms, but if that’s what he wants, then I want to plan for his “rebellious” departure from this earth.",2019-12-23 04:53:33

As of three weeks ago she’s mentally here and remembers things finally. I had to give her animal facts so I could tell if she was becoming impaired... low sodium and low red bloods cells made her strange.

She’s a nurse though so some days are easier than others. She’s really weak, so we don’t know how to keep her from being bored that she can do. She’s the go and do type. Her fine motor skills aren’t good.

She’s doing ok, her doctors think she’s only going to need one series of chemo to take care of it, but she’s nearing the end of the process and she’s really, like really struggling to eat and drink.
She can only keep down about 1 sip of water every couple hours. Which isn’t nearly enough to keep her fluids up as you might imagine, and she can’t handle anything above or below room temp.

She’s basically been living off about 1/2 an ensure and a glass of water a day, and she’s really trying to eat more stuff like applesauce or jello or pudding, but obviously she can’t keep a whole lot down and throwing up would bring us back to square one.
She’s also getting a lot of mouth sores and irritation from vomiting and from the chemo, so it’s really painful to swallow.
Her biggest fear is going on a feeding tube, before her sister had died she needed a feeding tube and it really scared her, she has enough trouble with her stoma bag already. 
I’m not a medical professional, I don’t have any experience as a caregiver and my job basically is just to do what I can to keep her spirits up, encourage her to eat and drink, and make sure she takes her medication.

Marijuana would be an option, but Missouri (where we live) has no regulated dispensaries yet, and won’t probably til late 2020, which obviously doesn’t help us.

I was 19 at the time and looking into colleges, but my grandparents raised me and I instead opted to become my grandmother's caretaker.  Her condition has gotten better and worse over the months.  Sometimes she seems fine and can do the things that make her happy like cooking and playing games with me and my cousins, and sometimes she is in too much pain to move or speak and has to be rushed to a hospital.  She is a very strong and funny and loving person and I have nothing but respect for her resilience and character, but my grandfather and uncle are not very sympathetic when she is at her low points, often accusing her of overreacting or pretending she is Feeling worse than she is for attention, and they will speak badly of her right in front of me or act frustrated with her to her face.

She can barely walk anymore, she has trouble sleeping for days on end and will babble incoherently to herself and others--and when she is coherent, all she talks about is dying, and it's breaking my heart because I still have my grandfather and uncle getting upset with her for being unable to take care of her hygiene alone or get around well, and they act convinced that she is faking it, and I feel like I have to do everything and that I am the only one who cares.  I think that maybe they are just in denial of the severity of the situation and reacting badly, but it just seems so meanspirited and makes me feel so alone because I put my life on hold to help.

Being a caretaker is hard and I feel bad for even admitting to having a hard time because I know that she is having a far harder time than me, but it's just so crushing to have to take care of someone who used to take care of you and knowing that no matter how hard you work or what you do, they will only get worse.  She needs me around so I can't get out much and get away from my grandfather and uncle's negatvitity very often and I never know how to respond to any of it anymore.",2019-07-13 10:13:25
Advice Needed,5,c82tqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/c82tqc/advice_needed/,4,1562058626.0,"This is my first ever post here or on any other subreddit (I believe). I just really need some advice from people who understand. 

I (F20) am currently a caretaker of my father who was diagnosed with stage IV kidney cancer in October. It has not been an easy road, especially because he still is dealing with the effects of his battle with stage II colon cancer from 2013-2015. I am able to have some “good” days; these days usually include me not breaking down about the current life situation I am in and I am able to have happiness with him on these days. Other days are hard...like when we found out the cancer spread to his bones. He can’t walk anymore and we have had to totally renovate our house for his limited mobility. 

I guess the advice I’m looking for is how to feel like a normal young adult again? I am only twenty and I feel so isolated in my current situation. I feel as if children usually do not have to deal with the mortality of their parents until much later...they do not have to worry about the parent missing their wedding or their first grandchild, or even the graduation of college. 

What are ways that I can feel like a normal young woman again without feeling guilty that I am not totally focused on my father?",2019-07-02 09:10:26

New here and need to vent,5,b64qri,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/b64qri/new_here_and_need_to_vent/,4,1553723527.0,"Hi. I’m glad this community exists. While my family has been close in the past, it’s getting more difficult to speak with my mom and sister. 

5 years ago my dad was diagnosed with stage IV  Squamous Cell on his tongue and throat. He was given 9 months to live. After chemo and radiation, we’re lucky he’s still with us. He was able to walk me and my sister down the aisle and meet his grandkids. Yay! 

Unfortunately in the past few years, my sister and I had a falling out and my mom and I don’t talk as much. My sister and I have started to rebuild our relationship and have always said no matter what happens between us, we need to put it aside to be there for our parents. I love my mom dearly and have a decent relationship with her. I’m definitely closer with my dad and my mom is closer with my mom. 

During my dads first treatment, chemo, my sister and I took on a lot of the caregiving. My mom seemed to be in denial, didn’t seem too interested in the day to day care. It was hard to watch my dad not get the support he needed from his wife. At that time, my mom was still smoking and refused to smoke outside and saw no issues with how it would impact my dad’s recovery. That kept up for 2 years. 

A few weeks after chemo ended, my sister and I had our falling out. (My husband and I took my family on vacation and my brother in law, sister’s husband, got drunk, hit on me and pushed me against a wall when I refused, all in front of my sister! In the morning I told her I thought it was best if he left, but wanted her to stay and have time with my dad. She said no, he’s staying. After that they both started drinking again. I asked them to leave the next day.) I know it upset my parents, but they said they understood. Plus, they’ve never been huge fans of her husband. 

After that, my dad started radiation on his throat. Because of the family drama, the toxic work environment I was in and my own mental health, It was hard for me to be there for my dad as much I was had been. My mom did a 180 from being kind of passive to controlling all aspects of his care. Which was good because he needed a peg tube and supervision with his pain meds. She wouldn’t accept any help from us, extended family or friends. Once my dad recovered from radiation and was tumor free, things relaxed a bit.

My sister had her 1st child and we all kind of came together again. I eventually resigned from the toxic job (that was really tough) and became very depressed. I’m glad to say that battle is over and I’m taking good care of myself now. 

This past October we learned my dad’s cancer returned in his lung and started immunotherapy. His oncologist talked immunotherapy up as the miracle we were hoping for, telling us how well his patients have done on it. I think his optimism and calmness didn’t give us much reason to be concerned. 2 weeks ago we found out it wasn’t working. Dad started chemo yesterday. He’s always been in good spirits, had a good sense of humor about all this and says he’ll stop fighting. Yesterday while sitting with him, I saw a fear in his eyes I hadn’t before. Understandably. 

I’m concerned about the care and support my dad is receiving at home. My mom is now 71, still works part time from home and babysits my sister’s 2.5 year old and now her newborn son, for 30-40 hours/week. My dad had rearranged his work schedule to accommodate my mom needing help with just 1 grandchild. My sister is a lawyer that works out of her house.  I live less than a mile away (I’m job hunting so my schedule is flexible) and her in-laws live a street away from them. Seeing what a burden it is on my parents, I’ve offered to watch my niece and nephew countless times, but she prefers my mom watches them. When I talk to my mom, the only thing she’ll talk about is my niece and nephew. 

My dad felt (and now even more) that my sister was/is taking advantage of them. He finally told my mom he’s upset with my sister for expecting them to watch her kids full time, especially now that my he’s going through chemo. My mom said it’s not a problem and doesn’t understand why it matters. My sister and her husband have always been closer with his family and I know it hurts my parents that they don’t spend time with them outside of babysitting and especially on the holidays. My parents don’t even bother asking them with help them around the house, so the help they do need, falls to my husband and me. We’re happy to help, but it’s frustrating. 

My biggest concern is my dad receiving the care and attention he needs at home from my mom. I’m frustrated because I can’t  do anything about it. 

Sorry for the rant and to those that made it to the end, thank you.

I have 2 young kids and a wife battling breast cancer,5,az44bo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/az44bo/i_have_2_young_kids_and_a_wife_battling_breast/,3,1552171246.0,"It's been exactly 21 months since my wife was diagnosed.  At the time our children were 3 and 1 years old.  Now they are 4 and 3.  My wife has gone through month of chemo, surgeries and chemo pills.  On top of an already very difficult home life situation, I also have a full time job, mostly working from home.    


I've been struggling with how honest I am with clients about what is going on because I'm afraid they'll think I'm incapable of getting work done and won't want to work with me anymore. For the most part many people I work with/for know what's going on but I always say things like ""we're getting through it"" and ""there are some tough days here and there"".  In truth everyday is extremely difficult both physically and emotionally.  Every minute of my life is either taking care of my wife or kids, running errands or working.  I usually work very late hours in order to catch up and then I'm up bright and early to get the kids off to school.    


We do have paid help a couple of days a week and sometimes family and neighbors chip in so we are incredibly fortunate in that regard.  But even with help I'm still stretched thin and struggling every day.  


Lately I've had clients who have been very unforgiving to me.  I've done incredibly good work for them for years but I've been struggling meeting deadlines.  On top of everything I'm going through, it's terrible to have clients telling me I'm failing because I'm asking for an extra day here and there to get things done, or sometimes moving conference calls at the last second because I have to deal with family.  


Unfortunately I can't just tell them so screw off because I do need the money.  It's just such a terrible feeling to do everything you can to please everyone and on top of that be criticized and demeaned.  It's infuriating to get comments from people who have no idea what it's like to go through this.  ""Can't your family help?"", ""Can't you get a full time nanny?"" People seem to hate excuses no matter what it is.

&#x200B;

I just don't know how to handle these people and my work situation.  I'm a responsible guy getting treated like someone slacking off.  It's difficult enough to have two young kids, or to have a wife with cancer.  I have both and I'm trying my best here.

  
Has anyone had a similar experience?  


On one good note my wife's cancer has not spread so we do fully expect her to pull through but she has 12 more months of chemo pills. ",2019-03-09 22:40:46
May I please have some of your knowledge / experience to help my mom?,4,ag6774,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/ag6774/may_i_please_have_some_of_your_knowledge/,10,1547567661.0,"Dear Redditors,

As I am writing this request, my mom is right now getting radiotherapy through her skull to eradicate a cancer thing. I feel extremely worried. She has 3 children, and with 29 years I am the oldest. Perhaps not surprising I am the lead in her caretaking. 

I want to cook for her the coming weeks, but she needs to gain some weight also. I want her to feel happy and strong. Alive, healthy...

Just to protect her and myself I will say that I also post in The_Donald and many would consider me a neo-nazi. I don't want to go into that now but I have been banned from many subs just because of that. If your political stance is holistic for your personality, please ignore my question. Those who can separate the two I will be very grateful for.

Can you please advise me what I can cook for her, with extremely basic kitchen things, that is ultra healthy? Something with a high calorie density which is also nutricious :) I made her drink chaga mushroom tea for months before her treatment and she already improved drastically just from that. Is it okay for her (56 years old) to keep drinking it after her radiation therapy?

And I can't cook the same or similar things all the time, right? How can I vary? Which nutrients should I avoid for her and which one should I deploy rich? Money is not an issue.

Thank you so much, and warm regards,

Just fucking Over it already!!!,6,aav16u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/aav16u/just_fucking_over_it_already/,5,1546196316.0,"I'm so over already. My mother is dying slowly of bone cancer. The doctor said she was hospice ready....that was sweet talk really to my sister and i. We've been the major caregiver's to our mother.
She made us promise we wouldn't put her in a nursing home or have outside help come in. If we knew how bad and how fucking emotionaly draing this was going to be we would have never agreed to saying we would do it all.
It started out with her comming home from the nursing home after a surgery that paralyzed her leg..she was talking her normal self minus her ability to walk. So that meant she needed minimal assistance. 
Then she complained about horrible headaches. The doctor did a head C.T scan and found 3 meningioma tumors. He had told us it's a progressive thing to where we won't recognize our mother. I thought "" no it can't get that bad "" i was saddly mistaken. Those tumours have hijack our mother!!.
We have been riding the emotional roller coaster. One day she's okay the next she's bat shit crazy thinking were trying to kill her dog and her. She refuses to take her meds cause she thinks were trying to poison her. Thanksgiving was a shit show.
Ny husband and myself get up every morning to go get her ready for the day. But before we go the only thing we have left of our life is the gym. So as a result we have to get up at the ass crack of dawn after working a 12 hr shift my self and bang out an hour there. Where we really don't get a good work out in cause were looking things up on the phone as how to best take care of new things that pop up. The newest being we just discovered that her heel of her foot has rotted flesh. That happened with her out of control lymphedema where her legs swelled to the point of her legs weeping fluid. Looking like they were gonna explode. We were so busy chasing bed sores that we missed the heel of her foot decaying. Now the aweful guilt i feel cause in reality i'm not a fucking nurse. Nor do i want to be but i bet i could be now.
Thanksgiving we found her in her wheelchair at the edge of her seat getting ready to face plant. Thinking she could stand and just WALK!! Gotta talk to her like she's 2 years old. Try not to startle her. I say "" mama today is Thanksgiving were gonna have a great day "" i tell her we gotta get ready. It went from happy to "" get the fuck out of my house "" at the top of her lungs. She thought she wasn't going to get a shower. The night before my sister had given her one. She didn't belive me. She thought we had tricked her and left her out of the days festivities. Said she was gonna call the police on me. For what i don't know. I say "" fuck it, i'm done. I just can't. "" There's never a thank you. There's always a fight about something that she's made up in her head. I fleed the situation. My husband was able to talk her down. Everyday it's insane. Like a fucking dream of straight crazy.
Of course we have the siblings that don't even help. It's all so very disturbing. The whole care of our mother is on my sister and i and my husband. . Those other 6 siblings like to come sniffing around to see what if anything might be left to them
 Fuck their mother and us. We can just go on forever like this in their minds. They see our mother here and there and her deteration is obvious. I can see them coil in discussed. Not shocking to us who care for her every fucking day!! Whats shocking to us is how you all could care less about our mother and let us 2 girls do everything. 
She takes 15 mlgs of morphine plus 8-10 vikoden es plus 40 mlgs lasixs,eliquis,cipro and last but least the stool softener. She swears that its a mexican jumping bean. I can't tell her any diffrent or she looses her shit and kicks me out of her house. I wait ten min outdide in the freazing cold and go back in and its just like she just saw me. Like nothing ever happened.
She resisted the hospital bed cause she thought we were trying to put her to bed for the rest of her limted life. It was a nightmare trying to convince her to go to bed. She wanted to sleep in her chair wich lead to bed sores on her bum cheecks and the inside of her thighs. And she'd stay up for 3 days straight. No good rem sleep. Wich made her bat shit crazy. Wich leave my sister and i exausted. 
If we knew that her death was gonna draggggg onnnn and onnn we would have never agreed. It's fucking torture. We have my sister and i spent our life savings. Myself 17 grand. All my money i was saving to buy a house. Her care and comfort cost. Something the other 6 wont contribute too at all. But they want their share in the end. Christmas they all were sniffing around.  They all felt soo bad. Ok then fucking help!!! 
I fear her death is gonna drag on and on. Death is negative in itself but throw in three exausted care givers who promised to not get help its beyong. I'm so fucking over it. My mother is gone i accepted that a while back. Now i'm taking care of a verbally angry person. Who is dying. I never went to school for those kind of things  Bathing, dressing feeding a parent. Are we supposed to see our parents so vulnerable and out of control? Is this gonna change how i see my mother.  I have to get out of this negative place. I feel swallowed whole. When she yells i feel lik a child who has pissed of their mother but then i gotta be the one who is firm take control of situations and force her to take her meds, force her to get dressed. Force her out of bed. It feels so wrong to forse my mother to do anything. I hate that i look like the asshole to my mother. She asks me every day "" what happend to me "" i tell her. And everytime she says "" no one told me i have cancer "" it kills me.
Then when i'm done with her and go to work for 12 hrs im stresed to death can't concentrate on my job. I make tons of mistakes. I'm literally atanding sleeping. As soon as my body stops. I feel myself twitch like i just was gonna fall asleep. Doing now as i write this. I feel so guilty for feeling everything i feel. But I'M FUCKING OVER IT!!

How do I respond to my mom's mental state? And can anyone tell me what the future holds?,6,9q93lw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/9q93lw/how_do_i_respond_to_my_moms_mental_state_and_can/,3,1540200210.0,"Fair warning, this will probably get longer than I planned. TLDR at the bottom.  


About three months ago my mom ended up in the hospital and was diagnosed with Small Cell Lung cancer. At that time, it was about a 6cm mass in her left lung, was wrapped around her bronchial tube and is in her esophagus and liver. There was a large, inconclusive area in her lower back that may be scar tissue. Her prognosis, with treatment is 12-18months.   


She completed 10 round of radiation and three weeks after that (though she should have gone in immediately after, based on her symptoms) she went into the hospital and spent three weeks trying to get her blood counts back to an even remotely safe level. During those three weeks, she was given her first round of chemotherapy which helped to keep those counts dangerously low (Her platelets were at .13 at one point and the best they ever got to was 27 when ""normal"" is 140-440). She got sepsis while there and so she was given intense antibiotics and (not related to the sepsis) had to be catheterized. She was released from the hospital with the catheter one week ago.   


Her physical health seems to be stable but that last week in the hospital and since then, her mental health seems to have plummeted. She has withdrawn even more than usual, and she is one to isolate herself on a great day, and is lost now that she is no longer able to work. Her identity was in that job and now that she is unable to work, she feels as if her life has no purpose. She says she just sits all day with nothing to do but will not respond to any of the many, many offers and suggestions that have come her way to get her out or to pass the time. It's like everything goes in one ear and out the other.   


Through all of this, I have been her main caregiver and support. During her hospital stay, I was there all but two of the days and on those ""off days"" I was in contact with her nurse, a doctor and my mother. Since coming home, I have pulled back a bit but am in contact with her daily and have been taking her to appointments and such. She says she wants me there but when I come, all she does is repeat the same complaints. For the last two weeks, I've tried to offer suggestions/solutions, just listened and held her while she cried, just sat silently to be there with her and even tried being more ""stern"" with a ""snap out of it"" sort of approach. Nothing I say or do, don't say, don't do, seems to matter at all.   


I believe she has had depression most of her life, at least since my early high school years. Life has been very hard on her, but her response to all of it seemed more depressive than stressed and this really seems to be the case now. I realize that I do NOT understand what it's like to face death and carry the weight of all of what comes with that, but it's so hard to see her not even try to pick herself up. While she's always been focused on herself this has caused her to really go down that hole. She's never been one to be overly interested in the lives of others, my life or my kids but now, I'll be with her for 4-5 hours and she won't even ask about them or how I'm doing. She doesn't even want to look out the window and discuss the weather. It's just a repeat of the same complaints from the day before.   


All of this to say:  
1- I'm frustrated. I will never say this to her and I feel like a complete jerk for even thinking it but it's true. I feel like a total a hole for being relieved when I took a day ""off."" I can't imagine what her life is and I feel so guilty for being selfish myself and letting her depression be annoying--even typing that--ugh. I'm hoping that pulling back, just a bit, and refocusing myself will help refuel me, so to speak, so that I can be 100% for her.   


2-Has anyone else dealt with a loved one with small cell? I know every person and every case is different but I want some sort of mental picture for the future. The cases I've found online tend to be from survivors who started with a different diagnoses or prognosis, and while that's wonderful, I know my mom's chances of actually beating this are slim to none. I'm a planner and I like to have some idea, no matter how much it can change, of what lies ahead. What should I watch for? What is this going to be like? This grey area between now and when/if she dies is hard for me and I realize that's my own issue and something I just have to accept--that it will be grey until it's not--but any type of experiences or advice would be so appreciated.   


**TLDR:** My mom has small cell lung cancer and is (in my opinion) very depressed and unwilling to do anything to even attempt to change that. How do I deal with those emotions and what can I expect for her physical health and my responsibilities as her illness progresses?

I was wondering what are some of the largest challenges you guys face on a daily basis - please do share them, even if you feel they cannot be solved with an app. It could be challenges regarding taking care of your loved ones, or difficulties you find when trying to cope mentally. We are also open to any suggestions for app ideas (no matter how unfeasible).

Thank you very much, I'd be grateful for any feedback. Apologies if this question has been asked before.",2018-10-18 01:11:36

Dear Mr. Mauldin, Mr. Darrow, and Ms. Popp-Hellebuyck

My name is Heather Ross and my husband is Lt. Colonel Gary Ross. We are an active duty military family temporarily staying at the Residence Inn in Denver while my husband receives cancer treatment at the Colorado Blood Cancer Institute. When we got here and met with the Oncologist he said that we would be here for a minimum of 6 months or longer; pending the outcome of his chemo treatment. So naturally we wanted to get Gary a comfortable La-Z-Boy recliner to provide comfort to him while he recovers from his surgery and upcoming treatments. When we arrived at your store #216 (with our service dog Lucy in tow) we met your associate, Kate and she knew exactly what we wanted. The prices were so good, we ended up purchasing TWO of your recliners!

We explained to Kate that Gary would be having surgery early Wednesday morning (Sept 5th) and that’s why we would like to have the chairs in place prior to that procedure. She said she couldn’t make any promises but would see what she could do.

Tuesday afternoon Kate called and said that due to the Labor Day holiday she couldn’t get a driver to deliver until Wednesday. We explained that we wouldn’t be home all day on Wednesday because of Gary’s surgery but that evening would be okay. She asked if she could call us back after looking at the schedule. We said absolutely and then never heard back from her.

We were sitting in our hotel room having dinner when there was a knock at the door. There standing with recliner #1 was Kate. She had a huge smile on her face and she said that she was delivering our two recliners. We stood there in shock as she rolled the recliner right into the room, put it all together and explained how it worked. My husband is very limited in moving items but we offered to help and she said absolutely not. She went downstairs and in a few minutes she was back at the door with recliner #2.

Again, she rolled it right in and set it up for us. I couldn’t fully express my gratitude because I didn’t want to start “ugly” crying. Cause let’s be honest, once the “ugly” cry happens it’s a hot mess for a solid two hours.

We were floored by Kate’s KINDNESS and her amazing CUSTOMER SERVICE. Amazing customer service and kindness are not often highlighted or appreciated as it should be. In a world of constant bickering and people being mean, when we have something GOOD happen it NEEDS to be celebrated and acknowledged. So please know as a caregiver, Kate is truly a hero and as a military spouse I don’t use that word lightly.

Thank you Kate and La-Z-Boy for allowing my husband the opportunity to come home from surgery and relax comfortably. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for making this incredibly difficult time a lot less stressful.

Customers for life and HUGE fans of Kate! 🙂

When should I move in with my dad full time?,6,96auwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/96auwa/when_should_i_move_in_with_my_dad_full_time/,11,1533963989.0,"Hey guys. Really wish I wasn’t here... but I’ve been reading on this sub for a few months, and this is my first post here. My dad has been diagnosed with stage 3 pancreatic cancer. He has only undergone two chemo treatments so far, with four more to go. 

Right now, he is still pretty functional, although he obviously gets tired a lot. I used to live six hours away. Earlier this year, I moved to a town about an hour away from him. I go to every appointment with him, and I am his medical power of attorney. He lives alone. My mother died ten years ago from liver disease. Fortunately, I work remotely, so being there for him when he needs me is not a problem. 

We have talked about the fact that me and my spouse will probably need to move in with him at some point. He is happy with that arrangement, and so am I. But I want to give him as much autonomy as I can until living with him becomes a necessity. 

I understand that no two situations are the same, so the answer will be different for everyone. But in your experience, how can you know when it’s time to move in and presume the role of caregiver? Are there specific things I should be looking for, or specific questions I should ask his oncology team? I would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks in advance. ",2018-08-11 05:06:29
Everybody is telling me that the hard part is almost over but I still feel like the world is about to fall apart (long post- I don’t know where else I can put this),5,92slfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/92slfu/everybody_is_telling_me_that_the_hard_part_is/,3,1532870884.0,"
I am 21, my fiancé-to-be (24) has a nonseminomas retroperitoneal  germ cell tumor at stage IIIB.  His tumor was the size of a cantaloupe before treatment, pressing on tons of nerves, and they originally thought it was starting to wrap around his aorta (it wasn't thankfully).
The month he was diagnosed I was about to sign a lease to an apartment and he was about to make a 630 mile move to live with me. I live in Pennsylvania but have spent a little over a year in North Carolina being the sole caregiver to my partner outside of of the occasional ride to the hospital from his father.
He was misdiagnosed for around five months and the doctors told us that had he not started the treatment when he did he would have been dead within a month- the cancer was very close to spreading to his lungs and brain. I still don’t understand how they know that and have been to terrified to ask and worry about the “what ifs” for his cancer.
After four five day cycles of cisplatin and etoposide over four months he was scheduled for a Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in February of this year. His team told me to go homes, and start planning our lives together, the hard part was over, he was stable.
I started college and took a week off to go and be with him the week of surgery.
His tumor markers skyrocketed in between this last round of chemo and the surgery... So I went on medical leave and again became his sole caregiver.
Three rounds of carboplatin and etoposide each round followed by autologous stem cell transplants. As of two days ago he had his RPLND surgery and they were able to remove the whole tumor without needing to do valve replacement or reroute anything like his team had anticipated needing to do. The tumor was the size of a baseball after all the treatment according to his surgeon. They were able to remove all the lymph nodes and entire tumor.
We get the pathology report back in a week to start figuring out the next steps.
Today was the first day in well over a year he was in unbearable pain in his back and abdomen and he was able to get up and move to the chair, is hungry, and drinking all things vital to his recovery. I am ecstatic for him, how well he did and he's not as terrified now. His father tried to tell him he was cancer free now but I corrected him. The tumor his gone but the doctors have Not told him or even mentioned him being cancer free at this point in time... He told me he wants to move and just pretend all of this was just a horrible dream which would be nice! I am working with his team to coordinate with a transplant center where I live so he can get his shots, labs, scans, and other appointments he needs without having to travel back and forth every few months.
The tumor may be gone and his pain is much better but everything in me is still bracing for the next thing and every older adult I have spoken to told me that likely will not fade until he hits the five year mark. I am exhausted. I love this man more than anything in the world and dropped out of my life twice to do everything in my power to help him through this but I am SO TIRED. Tired and sad and angry at everything even though it was nobody's fault. Sorry for the extremely long post its been a long year.",2018-07-29 13:28:04

Important things to note- we have a 4 year old and our families are about 6 hours away. 

The short back story is that my 32 year old husband was diagnosed with a possible Liposarcoma last week. He has surgery scheduled for the 5th and after that we’ll know more. The dr last week was very optimistic that once the tumor is out he will be totally fine, maybe need some radiation but not super likely. 

Here’s the horrible part. I have caught myself thinking that if it were more serious and he didn’t make it.. I wouldn’t hate that. I can’t even type that without having to pause and think about deleting it because it’s awful. I feel like the worst spouse ever for thinking that, and I’m hoping that maybe it’s just stress and anger and anxiety catching up with me because I am not facing and dealing with my emotions. Instead I’ve been focused on listening to his fears and emotions and making sure he keeps it together. 

Are these feelings normal? I’m totally waiting to hear back from a counselor about a session but crowdsourcing because I don’t even know how to bring this up with my friends. ",2018-06-26 05:43:15
Boyfriend has major guilt about going to college while his mom was sick,4,8f7aoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/8f7aoz/boyfriend_has_major_guilt_about_going_to_college/,1,1524815305.0,"My boyfriend’s mom had terminal cancer off and on for about 16 years. She had amazing comebacks that beat the odds countless times. She passed away less than two years ago, about three months after we started dating.  This was right after my bf’s senior year of college. 

He is the smartest, kindest, most motivated person I know and is currently working on his PhD. I add this for two reasons. First is that he would do anything he could to help anyone, especially the people he loves. Second, he is trying to be a professor and going to a top ranked school, even out of state, was important for what he wants to do with the rest of his life.

He has a really hard time with the loss of his mom. I think the extended period of dealing with feeling like she was getting better and then having to make peace with her passing over and over made everything so much worse in the healing process for him. 

I know that his mom supported him going to college to continue pursuing his future. She would have hated holding him back. Especially with all the uncertainty with her condition. 

He feels so guilty that he didn’t stay home or at least closer to home to help his mom. He sister went to school closer to home and I know that makes him feel worse.

What can I do or say to help him? I love him so much and it hurts to see how much he blames himself. ",2018-04-27 07:48:25

My brother is staying here with us full time, and his wife comes over daily. Basically a non stop stream of visitors which is good to keep her distracted. 

Honestly, I hope, when it happens, that she just falls asleep. Please, no seizures, no coma, nothing too painful. Just sleep.

January 30, didn't know my 54 year old mom has cancer. Definitely had some health problems, but after a lifetime of poor choices that's to be expected.

January 31, find out she has a large, stage IV, malignant adenocarcinoma in her right lung that has metastasized to her spinal fluid and meninges. I didn't even know leptomeningeal carcinoma was a thing. Super rare, aggressive, terminal. What the everlasting fuck.

I quit my career and moved from a place, man, and life that I love back to a place I moved away from for a reason to stay with her. No one asked me to, but neither did anyone tell me not to in any way, shape, or form.

This shit sucks. In just over a month she has lost almost all control of her legs. She has a facial palsy and food tastes different. Her ribs are now alternating between excruciating pain and tingling numbness. She has lost 20 lbs and hardly puts effort into eating, drinking, or moving regularly even though she knows those things will help. She hollers in pain most mornings until the pain meds kick in and she can get comfortable.

I want to help her. I want her to maintain her dignity and independence for what little time remains to her. But this is fucking hard. I listen to her holler but can't help. I've had to carry her and scoop her up off of the floor twice now. I'm constantly pushing food and liquids and meds, but usually I'm just ignored. 

AND I MISS MY FUCKING LIFE.

I'm watching my mom die. And it sucks. And I think I need more help with this, but my brother never has time because kids and her friends are unreliable and, to be honest, I'm terrible at asking for help.

Here we are in May and she is now in hospice care, about to be in a nursing home. When her oxygen arrived from the hospice this past Sunday, it seemed like everything sped up. Yesterday (Tuesday) she could barely speak, she can't move, can't eat due to slowed digestion, and can't really take medicines due to throwing everything up. 

The hospice is at home care my mom had set up without me. The nurse visits twice a week, which is not enough. I don't know what I'm doing! Ive been trying to get her in a nursing home since Sunday, but the social worker didn't visit till Tuesday, and he says he would try to move her that day, but 6pm rolled around and I didn't hear anything. We're waiting on the admissions person at the nursing home now.

My mom hasn't eaten in about 2 days. Even if she got something in she would throw it up. She is constantly nauseous. The medicine they gave us for nausea causes constipation, but it's one of the only ones she can take. She is in pain, but the morphine drops they gave us hardly do anything. Again, she can't swallow much without throwing up, they cause constipation, they last 2 hrs max, and so she is constantly in pain. She has ascites, which is a fluid that builds up in her body all the time that she has to drain. She does that herself, but it takes up a lot of her energy. I had been taking care of her by myself for 3 days, and I finally got my sister here to help. 

Scariest moment of my life happened today. My mom could no longer walk to the bathroom just due to lack of oxygen (even with the machine) so while waiting on a bed pan to arrive from hospice, we had to roll her using a chair to the bathroom. She had to go, and we had no other choice. We got her in the chair, and she just can't control her head or body. We start to roll her and her eyes just glazed over. She wasn't responsive to our calls. Her arms and legs were shaking. She finally spoke and asked a question that didn't make sense, like she was disoriented. She pointed the wrong way and asked why don't we go that way? We tried to ask why mom? She still had to go and seemed back to us, so we made it to the bathroom. She complained her head wasn't supported in the chair so once we got her back in the chair I stood behind her holding her up. 

I'm so scared what I will face tomorrow, and I don't know how much more I can take. I can't sleep and I just want medical help. I don't want her to be in pain anymore. I don't know what I expected, but this is my worst nightmare.

I posted about this all earlier but to recap, she was told she had cancer in her spinal fluid. They put a reservoir in to do chemo with. She had issues with that and had to have it taken out. They said she tested positive for an infection in the spinal fluid. They inserted a drain and monitored her CSF for the last 2 weeks. She only tested positive for an infection once, and now the lab is saying they see no cancer cells either. So WTF indeed. 

My dad has stopped his life and work to be here basically as often as he can. We did a gofundme for my him because people wanted to donate but we didn't want to hassle with gathering the money. It was outrageous how generous people are.

Her WBC was dangerously low and so we had to go 30+ miles each way for 5 days to get Neupogen injections. Annoying, but she felt so much better after the 5th one, it was worth it.

She's feeling cruddy again now, but she is supposed to be calling her Onc and making sure they don't want to see her prior to her next chemo on Thursday.

I had a moment at her last treatment. I was able to take her and we were there ALL day. Literally 8am to 5pm. She does 2 hours of fluids, followed by 2 chemos (Cisplatin and another one I can't think of), followed by another 2 hours of fluids. We get there at 8am to get blood work and she never starts her chemo until around 11 or 12. It's very frustrating to have to sit around all morning waiting. 

The chemo room was extremely packed. As in there wasn't an empty seat in the place. That was very sad to me. MOST of the people seeking treatment were elderly, but I always cringed when I saw the younger ones. Cancer sucks for ANYONE but to see someone around my own age (33) there just broke my heart.

Around 1pm, when I got back from a lunch run (mom has had a great appetite this time around, woohoo!) I had my moment. You see, my aunt was recently diagnosed with Stage IV liver/colon cancer (no one seems to know which was primary) for the first time. It's not a good prognosis. When I got back, she and my other aunt (who had throat/tongue cancer) were waiting to be called back. They came back with me...and it was just very surreal. 1. my mom was being treated. 2. my aunt sat in one of the chemo chairs for the first time. 3. my other aunt who lost a portion of her jaw and over half of her tongue was there. All 3 of these ladies have or are fighting cancer...and only 2 of them are blood related. It was just gut-wrenching to be honest.

But...if anyone can get through this, it's these strong ladies. They are determined to live, even if that means putting their bodies through hell.

Thanks for listening. :)",2017-01-04 03:37:21

My husband and I have a loved one who was recently diagnosed with cancer.

In the past few months he has lost 80 pounds because he can’t keep food down and has no appetite. His urologist suspected prostate cancer after an elevated PSA. We got biopsy results and bone scan results last week and it’s advanced prostate cancer that has metastasized into his bones.

They set his first oncologist appointment for October 1. Once his doctor called with biopsy results he was able to move that up to September 24th.

In the meantime my dad is in severe pain and can’t hold food down and is acting very loopy. As a result of all the vomiting his blood pressure is insanely high because he throws up his medicine.  We went to his primary doctor as walk-in and got him pain meds (hydrocodone with acetominophin 5-325) and they do nothing. They gave him promethazine too for nausea, it does nothing.

WTF do we do to get him adequate medical care?? He needs hospice, he needs to actually start the hormone treatment for prostate cancer, SOMETHING.

I think we can all agree cancer is a vile disease that has taken the lives of too many lovely people out there...
My name is Hailee and I’m a cancer survivor. March 16, 2021 will mark one decade of remission for me, and I thank the stars every day. 
I’ve come here on recommendation of my boyfriend to tell you a bit about my story...
I was 14 when I was diagnosed with aggressive osteogenic sarcoma, and my life was flipped on its head.
Going through the hardest year of my life, I made a lot of deep realizations about myself and the Illness. I had started writing prose pieces that gave people some insight into my life as a teenage cancer patient, and little tricks I used to get by.
A few years after completing chemotherapy, my mother and I decided to combine our minds to bring a book to you, that we hope can touch the lives of someone in need of it.
You’ll find chapters from both patient and caretaker perspectives, with tips at the end of each segment. Tips for patients, caretakers, and friendly people who aren’t sure how to lend a hand.
I felt weird about making this post initially because I didn’t want it to seem like a huge “look at me” ordeal... I just kind of wish I had something like this when I was going through it . The only reason we made the book was to hopefully help a family who needs it like ours did, and if I don’t tell people it’s out there no one will know.
If you are interested in reading more about our story and how we tried to make the impossible possible every day, follow us on social media, or grab a copy for you or someone you care about! 
Thank you for you time and much love!

Need Advice - Caring for Parent with Glioblastoma Brain Tumor,3,f2mtgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/f2mtgz/need_advice_caring_for_parent_with_glioblastoma/,0,1581517037.0,"(Crossposted in r/braincaner forum for extra help - thanks!)

Sorry for the long rant - I'm at my wit's end and would love some advice.  My mother (72) has stage four Glioblastoma, diagnosed just over a month ago and we are 2 weeks into radiation/chemotherapy treatment.  Myself and 2 other family members are taking care of her.  Her tumor is inoperable, deep in the posterior corpus callosum.  Her initial symptoms were confusion and weakness.  After being put on steroids at diagnosis, she became manic - talking 24/7, insomnia, grandiose thoughts, etc.  It is unbearable.  

Over the last month (and after a 2nd hospital stay), steroids have been tapered down and things have gotten a little bit better (after trying 2 different types of sleeping pills and supplements).  She still talks constantly (but tells herself to shut up 8-) and exaggerates everything!  What's even worse now is that she has become aggressive, paranoid, and demanding.  She tells the doctors she is fine and can walk, sit, stand - no problem.  She tells them she doesn't sleep because we constantly wake her up to give her medicine, then tells them we constantly forget to give her medicine when needed.  When she is with us, she says she is weak, dizzy, and constantly needs our help.  I think she is faking and exaggerating, but is it real in her mind and how do I know?  Is it because of the tumor, the meds, the swelling, or just her being immature?  She talks about getting me fired from my job so I can spend more time with her!  She has meltdowns and throws things at us, screams, stomps her feet, shakes her head violently, etc.  She constantly hides things and says ""don't let them take my stuff"", wants me to block off her drive way, her street, thinks people are watching her, etc.  She throws a fit not to go to the bathroom when we tell her to but then will have an accident and say it is our fault for not taking her.

The doctors have not been much help on this front.  They don't want to give her more meds (I guess because of brain interaction) and only treat the cancer saying that should make it better, but she is driving us as crazy as she is.  I've thought about recording her with my phone when she does this so I can play it for the doctors next time.   We live in a mid sized town but went to MD Anderson for the first time this weekend for a 2nd opinion and I was hoping they might shed some light but they were more upset about the new sleeping pill because it might add to her confusion.  I would rather she be confused and sleep at night.  At least we (her caregivers) can remain sane that way.  Has anyone dealt with something similar?  We are so frustrated and don't know what to do.  Treatment is important but this is incurable and quality of life is important too!

Thanks so much!",2020-02-12 14:17:17

My dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer around four months ago. It's already methastasized to his bones and probably the lymphatic system, and it has been advancing at an increasing pace.

The biggest problem with him has been getting him to stick to his treatments. He was put on testosterone blockers to slow down the spreading, but last week he stopped taking them because in his mind those are for his prostate and wouldn't help if the cancer is already in other places. 

He was given a casein diet to help him gain weight. He got enough for a month. It's been a month and a half and most of it is still untouched. 

Even analgesics, and even if he's in pain. The doctor prescribed him a patch and two different pills (buprenorphine patches, oxycodone and pregabalin in pills). He read about the side effects and decided to take only the patch. Even now that the pain is being too much for the patch, he's still refusing to start the pills because ""he doesn't want to fill up his body with chemicals"".

Mum found a lump in her breast,5,ch6fmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/ch6fmw/mum_found_a_lump_in_her_breast/,2,1563992920.0,"Today my (21F) mum (60sF) told me she found a lump in her breast in June. She didn’t tell me because I was at uni/graduating and she didn’t want to upset me, because I was already stressed about careers and jobs. 

My grandmother who I never met died of breast cancer in her early 60s, but she found it quite late and back then they didn’t have the same drugs and treatments. 

She said the lump is small, and doctors are taking her through the process quickly, and it will be removed o August 9th. She said they’re going to use radiation and some drugs that stop it coming back  (I can’t remember the name but I think it started with d or m). When she found out she told my aunt who got checked out, and they found the same thing but smaller, and also found that she didn’t have the gene for breast cancer so it shouldn’t be a genetic cancer. However surely it is if they both have it and my grandmother did?

Pretty much I just feel in my gut it’s worse than this. Honestly the idea of seeing my mum going through cancer and getting chemo is so scary, like she’s meant to be in my life forever. 

My mums friend apparently brought it up in conversation without mentioning her name, and someone said she had the same procedure and it wasn’t a big deal and she never thinks about it anymore.

I guess I’m just looking for advice and reassurance. I didn’t really ever think this day would come.

TL;DR Mum found a lump in her breast that’s quite small but I’m worried it’s something worse.",2019-07-24 18:28:40

I also personally feel like I do not have the emotional energy to deal with her drama, considering that I work, have a child, and have 2 parents who are both sick with cancer.

I find myself just needing to talk about this tonight.,3,c3kjgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/c3kjgw/i_find_myself_just_needing_to_talk_about_this/,5,1561202064.0,"I just found this sub. I’ll try to briefly get out where I am. My aunt told us she had lung cancer last December. She said she wasn’t going to get treatment, and that she had only as long as she could hold out left. My sister and I immediately made a plan with my cousin (her daughter. And we are all the family left that counts) to come and stay. My sister and I live 14 hours away, and both have kids. We worked it out where she or I was here, along with my cousin. I was here for the month of May, but had to leave because my son was struggling without me. He came with me this time, so that I can be here all summer. 

I got here a bit over a week ago. Things changed a lot over the two month I was gone. She lost 40 lbs (50 as of today, she’s 94 lbs) and a lot of mobility. The first few days I was here she was perkier, trying to eat at least once a day, and more capable of holding a conversation. 3 days ago she was asking for more flavors of koolaid, which is basically all she drinks. 

Then she didn’t eat that night, and hasn’t since. She had been getting up about 3 times a day, for a few hours at a time. Lately she’s gotten up twice a day and only for 1-2 hours, then back to sleep. She’s in more pain. She’s been kinda loopy. It’s like each day she declines so much, it feels way too fast. 

I just don’t know what each day will be like now. My nerves are shot. I check on her like every half hour, worried I’m going to walk in and see she’s not breathing. (I may be overdramatic about it, but I have no way of knowing what to expect.) I have anxiety issues and insomnia, but I had been getting on a decent sleep schedule. 2 days ago she had some sort of seizure that left us calling hospice at 10pm. She was fine an hour later, and hadn’t had an issue since, but it was terrifying. I haven’t really slept since then. Maybe a couple hours a night. I wake up about every hour. It’s nerve wracking stuff. 

I guess I just needed to vent, and see what you all have to say. I am worried with her not eating we may only have days left. (According to the book they brought, not eating and sleeping more means weeks to days, and it’s been several changes in quick succession.) I know it’s coming, and I know we are making sure she’s at least offered everything she needs, though mostly it’s been just increasing amounts of meds. I just don’t know if I’m ready. I don’t know what I’ll do if tomorrow is the day she no longer gets out of bed, or can hold a conversation, or makes sense. Tonight she said several things that just didn’t mean anything, and it seems those come on more and more each day. (She does carry on conversations too, it’s hit or miss and depends on the meds I think.)

Thanks to anyone who’s read this far. I know it could be worse. And I know there are so many of us here seeking guidance and barely holding it together. Hugs to anyone else who needs it.",2019-06-22 11:14:24

Understandably we are frustrated because he was out less than a week and he is in a different hospital in a different part of the province. Not to mention not even a straight awnser.

Later that evening the doctor checked up and told him he had doubts of his pneumonia, even with the xray and antibiotics.

Today they said that he was admitted with his white blood cells and he now has an allergic reaction to the antibiotics.  We were told we might be released but at this point I want him transferred back to our hospital were he can see his doctor.

Haven't found out yet if the primary site is her gallbladder or bile duct. Not much of a difference there, one has a five-year survival rate of less than 5%, the other has a five-year survival rate of 2%. 

She has two living siblings, so do I, and my former step dad is the father of my younger brother. I also happen to be very close to my former step dad. My own father passed away a few years back, they have been divorced since I was a baby.

 My older sister lives on the other side of the country, and their relationship is frequently very contentious. my sister is mentally ill and has a personality disorder as well, and quite frankly she can't get along with anyone for very long and is frequently blowing up at my mother and me over the smallest things. To a much lesser extent, my mother has the same tendency.

My mother has been alone since her divorce more than 10 years ago. She neither makes, nor keeps friendships very easily because of how oversensitive and defensive she tends to be. She holds grudges for the smallest slight, but finds excuses to explain why no one in her office gets along with her. in a nutshell she has several tendencies of borderline personality disorder, but not enough of them to fit the diagnosis completely.

It's kind of a contradiction, but she's a nurse and she does it extremely well. She's very compassionate and kind with her patients and has often worked in a setting where she's cared for people in hospice.

I'm struggling right now because she has made it very clear that she doesn't want me to tell my older sister, or my ex step dad, or anyone else about her condition.

it's very early in the stages, and we still don't have an official prognosis yet. Hopefully in the next week or two she'll have an idea about the goals she can set, and if it's going to be a matter of months versus years. 

I respect her privacy because I wouldn't want anyone sharing this information before I had a chance to. I think a large part of this however, is because she knows she hasn't treated some people very well in the past, and doesn't want them to turn around and be smug or gloat to her. 

Years ago when I told her that my stepmother was quite ill and had advanced dementia, she turned away from me so that I wouldn't see her smugly laughing about it. She also said on numerous occasions she was going to live to 'piss on' my father's grave. 

I know she doesn't want my ex step dad to know about this because she was absolutely awful to him during the divorce and in the years that followed. she did everything possible to sabotage his relationship with my younger brother, and the distance between them persists to this day.

I want to respect her privacy because it really should be her news, but several of my family members from my father's side, as well as my stepdad, are a big part of my personal support system. I'm not really sure if anyone else has dealt with this but I am going to have my own emotional needs, and I want to be able to talk to more than just my husband or my counselor about this.

We’re a group of engineering students from Imperial College London looking to design an app to help voluntary caregivers. A few weeks ago, we posted on this sub to find out what were some of the main daily struggles caregivers faced. The most common was isolation and the struggle to cope with daily stress. 

So, to help relieve stress from caregivers, we’ve been designing an app called Feet Up, Meet Up, a digital space where caregivers can either meet up with fellow caregivers for fun events together, or simply find activities on their own in their downtime. We’ve made it optional to bring dependants along, so caregivers can either have a fun day out together with their dependant, or get some time alone for self-care.

Please check out a prototype of our app: https://marvelapp.com/546fc9b 
In this app, your dependant’s name is Jane, and you’re going out for coffee.

It’s just a prototype, so it’s not fully functional. But we’d like to get feedback on the main concept (suggestions of relaxing activities and meet ups), app flow, ease of use, layout and appearance.

Thank you very much for your time and any feedback.",2018-11-26 22:13:26

She is currently unable to walk, very weak, sciatic pain. She hasn’t really been walking for almost 2 weeks. 

They have found fluid on her lung (the same side as the tumour) she is struggling to breathe, on oxygen sometimes.
They are unsure if it is pneumonia, or from the cancer. 
They are talking about draining the fluid, but she hasn’t been seen by the respiratory team yet.

She had 5 sessions of radiation on the tumor on her spine which has helped a lot with the back and sciatic pain, she had no reaction/side effects from the radiation. 
They are talking about doing chemo but she needs to be up and walking before they will start that.

She’s made an incredible run, and unfortunately she is in her last days at home. While I’m happy that she’s living out her final wishes, I’m confused. She has been bed bound for over a month now, and completely unresponsive for over a week, yet she still holds on because of how young she is. I’m only 21. 
 
I insist on going to work at nights rather than being home. At work I’m happy and joking, and I even use rather dark humor about my situation to cope and it gets a laugh out of my friends and coworkers including me. I’m worried I’m acting too nonchalant, but I’m trying to support my father and younger brother. 

This past Friday we told my younger brother what was going on, and he was devastated which is obviously expected. My father has also been doing his best to keep it together for his family, but I feel as if I’ve stepped up and taken his place in terms of emotional support. I feel terrible for what my father and brother are feeling, but I don’t think I am feeling the same way even though my mother and I are close as all hell. I’m the one telling them it’s going to be ok, I’m still going out with my brother to distract him (and I’ll occasionally go out with friends) and trying to go to the gym, I’m still doing volunteer work on the side, but I don’t feel like it’s impacting me as much as it should. Is this normal? I’m not too sad lately, I’m incredibly upbeat and honestly I’m treating my mother and the family as if she’s one of my patients. I’m just very matter of fact while also trying to keep a smile and work with the family. Is this normal? 

I guess I also don’t like when people say I’m handling it very well. I’m not sure how I’m handling it in this way, but I feel very emotionally disconnected ",2018-04-25 07:23:22

My dad,4,7y4d78,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/7y4d78/my_dad/,9,1518868304.0,"I’m writing this with tears just rolling down my face. 

My dad was diagnosed with tongue cancer 13 months ago, got surgery that removed 2/3 of his tongue and most of the lymph nodes on one side. Then a few months later started chemo & radiation, as the cancer was rather aggressive. He got a peg tube so he could get all the nutrients he needed. Except he wasn’t great at administering food & water so ended up in the hospital off and on for being dehydrated. 

Other than that, Things seemed all fine and normal for the most part for the rest of the year. 

About a month ago he had a follow up appointment and they found masses in his chest, right around his aortic valve so they do a surgical biopsy to verify if it’s cancerous. Of course it is. Why not. The healing process for that was very painful, as they had to cut in between his ribs.  That’s when the surgeon told me it was cancerous, and inoperable. 

About two weeks ago my dad called me at work saying he had been having trouble breathing and needed to go to the hospital, so I left work early and spent 8 hours in the hospital. The cancer had not only spread, it was restricting his lungs and they had to drain fluid from one lung. He stayed a little over a week. 

Now, after a flurry of doctor visits, we know he’s stage IV and has two options - palliative chemo or hospice. 

Is this real life? Is this weak person currently living with me really my father who has been my rock my entire life? Is he really not going to be able to meet any future children of mine and be able to dote on them? I’m too young for this, he should be healthy and we should be able to have a long time to go see Marvel movies and spend hours together nerding out together. 

I can’t help but think of his mom, who I’ve never known, as she died when I was 2. She is a stranger to me and it TERRIFIES me that that’s how my children will grow up, without my dad. 

These last 2 years have been absolute hell, I’ve been part caregiver for my grandparents (moms side) as my grandma has slowly gotten worse with dementia and my grandpa having too many health issues to count. This year is going to absolutely fucking suck and it’s so depressing to consider. They’re finally going to an assisted living facility tomorrow and I was so excited for them to have the care they need and we won’t have to worry about them as much and then BAM my dads dying. Jokes on me.

I have six years experience as a physician assistant taking care of patients with cancer. I loved my job but it is one that took a bit of an emotional toll on me. I struggled that I carried the stress and the losses home with me. The busier we got, I felt my visits with patients became rushed. How could I adequately answer all their questions and concerns in just 15 to 20 min time allocations per patient? (not including new patient visits) I worked very long hours trying to compensate but I guess I just needed a break. I have taken a few months off to explore some of my passions such as nutrition and travel. The courage to do this came from my patients- life is too short, they would say. Although, I'm not quite ready to go back, being away from the hospital and clinic, I miss my patients dearly! I know that being diagnosed with cancer can throw you for a loop and change your life upside-down. My question is for all of you going through cancer or family members or caregivers--- Do you feel you would benefit from discussing your case with an individual like myself over a 30 min to 1 hr long conversation where we could talk through the diagnosis and treatment and etc.? More from a scientific perspective and less of a support group. The purpose would be to add to the healthcare team- not take away from it. Your doctor would stay your doctor and I would just be an additional resource if nothing else then peace of mind that you are doing everything you can for the most favorable outcome. The purpose would be provide understanding of the disease and prognosis so that you are more prepared for your visits and at a better place mentally. Thank you for your time. Please do not hesitate to PM me if you have any questions or concerns. Wish you all and your loved ones the best. I have also posted on the other cancer group so sorry if there is duplication. thank you.",2018-02-03 03:58:06

We were all thinking his post chemo PET scan was going to be great. After 1 round of RCHOP Alec's tumor was decreased by 70%. After round 4 it was decreased by like 90% and was likely just scar tissue. PET after 6th round showed the original mass most likely dead (SUV of 2.2) and a new mass to the left of his heart the size of a cherry tomato (high activity and SUV of 9.9) 
Doc let us know he needs R-ICE and BEAM + SCT and that his chances have decreased by 30%. 
I feel like someone sucker punched me. I feel like there is a very real chance I will have to live without the love of my life. He means more to me than anyone. He is my best friend. We are so young and no one  understands and just says ""dont worry he will live and make it through this"" and I know they mean well but what if he doesn't?? I'm just supposed to live without the best person I have ever met??? this isnt fucking fair. I am so scared of what is to come. What if he gets an infection when his white count is low? What if he gets sepsis and dies? what if all this chemo fucks up his organs and he dies of something else? My mind is spinning and for the first time since this all started. I feel like I am going to lose him. I looked at him today and I tried to remember the exact way he looked in the sunlight in the car on the way home. Thinking to myself; I never know which moments with him are my last. Feeling pretty broken. Sorry for ranting.

Since July of 2015 I have been in an on-again and off-again relationship with my boyfriend. He was diagnosed with stage 2 lymphoma and when it went to stage 3 he ended our relationship. He went into remission a month after treatment, then was re-diagnosed with more cancer cells in different lymph nodes and went through treatment again. I have always been a supporter as we started off as friends and were freshly a new couple when his health started failing, and even when things were bad and we were ""broken up"" we had always had a non-labeled relationship where we acted like a couple even when we weren't officially a couple. In January of 2017 I moved to FL from CT to work on an internship for school. We briefly stopped talking for 3 months and then we started talking again in July and about a month later we started dating again. He was re-diagnosed with cancer, this time non-melanoma skin cancer that he got when his doctor's put him through an aggressive radiation treatment. He was optimistic about this form of cancer since to him it seemed a much easier battle to deal with than what he went through a year prior.

Well, in November when I came home to visit things seemed normal even as he waited for his treatment plan. About two weeks after my visit when I went back to Florida for the last six weeks of my internship, there was a shift in personality. We got into a huge fight because he was angry I went to a company holiday party. I thought he was being irrational and he would constantly be angry that I was never in my apartment (when you live with 5 other females do you blame me?) and would fly off the handle over minuscule things that never bothered him before. Come to find out, he had started taking chemo pills and they were making him ill. He was unable to hold any food down and was eating saltines and water in order to keep any nutrition in. He sounded emotionally defeated on the phone and he told me that he was avoiding his family so he also wanted to avoid me because he wanted to break up with me but he didn't want to make the mistakes he had made in the past, so he told me when I got home and he started getting better our relationship would start getting better.

I am home, and we haven't spoken in three weeks. I keep my distance but at the same time I am worried sick about him because on December 23rd he started his actual chemo on top of the pills. I know being involved with someone with cancer is putting your own feelings aside and just being supportive, but I feel so lost and confused as to how to be supportive when he doesn't want me or anyone in his life. I have a phobia he is going to die and I'll never know or get to say goodbye. My aunt died from kidney failure and complications from hemo-dialysis so I live with this fear that I will never be able to get that kind of closure. Is this normal behavior from someone enduring chemo? He refuses any kind of counseling or support network and even when I have mentioned side effects of treatment in the past he was very insecure and felt like he was ""gross"" for having cancer. My friends and family don't understand, they see it as he is being abusive because they don't understand the psychological toll cancer takes. Any form of advice would help, I feel so lost and don't know who to turn to.",2017-12-27 09:32:38

We've been fighting this since 2014, but it really kicked into high gear when we found out it metastasized in 2015. My dad and I both care for her, but I'm a college student so I have the most flexibility to take her to her appointments and help her with things. She's on a promising immunotherapy trial. She started having nausea in April, before the trial, but since beginning the trial, we think it's gotten worse. Now she's on marinol for nausea and when she can keep that down, it seems okay. Her issue is trying to keep it down to get it to work in the first place. For that, she has other medications, but she is becoming more confused and isn't taking them properly.

I live across the street, but I don't live with her, so I don't get to see everything she does and how consistently she takes her medications. She's told me that she's confused about how to take the medications, but she didn't want to call for clarification because she ""didn't want to disturb anyone's holiday."" Before that, it was the weekend. We have her doctor's phone number but she won't call it because she doesn't want to bother him at home. Her primary oncologist is now saying he wants to pull her off the trial early because the nausea is out of control, but she has told me she doesn't know if she's taking the medication right. She hasn't even told him all of what the study doctor has prescribed her, let alone that she hasn't been taking it like she should.

She is just constantly sick and I don't want to accuse her of not doing what she needs to do because she is very independent and has always been able to handle herself. But she isn't in the right frame of mind right now. She has lost 40 pounds in 3 months because she can't eat without getting sick. She's on THC pills that make her out of it. But she gets upset with me and tells me I'm being excitable when I tell her I want to call her doctor for her and clarify things. She doesn't want me to correct her or ask questions when she gets things wrong in appointments. I'm having to tiptoe around her to try to make sure she gets the care she needs.

I don't want her to get pulled out of this trial for nausea when we aren't doing absolutely everything the way we're supposed to. The doctors seem to think that the nausea and vomiting aren't responding to their treatments, but she isn't taking them as prescribed. Shes getting confused on dosing, forgetting doses or just throwing them up...

I am at a loss for what to do when my mom just won't let me step up and try to take some of this over for her. My dad isn't very organized when it comes to medical stuff and doesn't always take medications like he should either, and he's scared to tell her what to do. So I feel like I'm alone in this.

Long time lurker here. I'm my mother's primary caregiver. She was diagnosed with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer that had spread to her liver Sept 2016. By the time we finally got the diagnosis, the oncologist said she would have only had weeks without chemo. 

Flash forward to now. From everything I've read about this disease my Mom has done pretty well. She has been on a gemzar and abraxene regimen and us starting her 9th round this week. The biggest side effect she has had from chemo has been neuropathy. She isn't mobile anymore but at least we have the pain managed. 

Every 3 months she gets scanned and the first 2 showed shrinkage in the liver. The pancreatic tumor has never really shrunk but hasn't grown either. We just got her 3rd scan today and it shows that everything is at a stand still. Nothing grew. Nothing shrank. 

For now her Dr wants to keep her in the same chemo regimen and says that unless her neuropathy really takes over he doesn't feel the need to back off on any treatment. 

I don't know what I'm looking for here. I know no one can tell me what the clock reads on a ticking time bomb. I guess I'm just wondering, in your experiences, what happened after this stand still stage? Did it last very long? Did things start to go down hill?

Around 7pm on Sunday night my mom stopped being my mom. She didn't recognize me or my dad. She couldn't form a complete sentence. She was in so much pain. 

The ER doctor wanted to send her home. She's fighting cancer, he said. She's going to have some weakness and issues related to that because of chemo (that she hasn't had in almost 2 month). 

She was thrashing about screaming in pain. They finally got her settled enough to sleep a bit but it wasn't long. They scheduled an MRI to see if any tumors had formed in her brain or on her spinal cord. She can't lay still for them. They attempted to sedate her this morning but lab results were poor so they cancelled. Will try tomorrow. 

Doctor came in and gave us good but bad news. She has an infection in her spinal fluid. This could easily be causing her symptoms and not a tumor that might have formed. They are still checking her for that. 

It's a long road ahead for her and us. She's never not known who I was, that was a hard pill to swallow. But I'm relieved that they have a possible reason for the sudden change in alertness. 

Sorry I've been absent. Not dealing with this round very well. Never really thought my mom was close to death until now. 

Thankfully she's resting now. They are giving her a large dose of Ativan every 4 hours. Whatever it takes...",2017-04-05 05:13:06

Did therapy help you?,3,5i78ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/5i78ac/did_therapy_help_you/,4,1481702695.0,"My husband finished his radiation and chemo combination treatment a month and a half ago. Yesterday was supposed to be his first day back at work, but he's not feeling well and didn't end up going in until today. He's nauseous, and as of four days ago, has evidently developed neuropathy in his arms, which we thought we had gotten clear of since he wasn't actively in therapy any more. 

I've been back at work for five weeks now, and I came back to an absolute mess - severely reduced work force, everyone angry/grumpy/scared for their jobs, tons and tons of work undone because there wasn't enough staff, lots of people from outside the company yelling at me (till they got told off by someone else that I was out taking care of my husband who had cancer). 

In late June, I found out I was pregnant. In early July, we found out my husband had cancer, a week later I miscarried, three weeks after that he had major head/neck surgery, a month after that he started chemo. I held it together pretty well for a while, TBH - we moved close to the hospital for a month, away from our home, and I was coping OK if not great.

Over the last few weeks I feel like I'm coming unglued. I'm anxious and upset a lot, although I have long periods where I'm fine (like, a couple of weeks at a time). Last night I was up half the night convinced that he wasn't sick, but rather that his cancer had come back after only a few weeks and was destroying  his body. I'm dwelling on the thought of how I'm going to make it without him, how I'm going to raise our son alone, if I'll ever have any more children, etc. To cap it off, a close friend just got pregnant for a second time and when she found out I was upset (through my husband) she told me that I shouldn't make her pregnancy about me (which, yes, correct, but fucking harsh), and I honestly don't think I ever really got to process the miscarriage because so much else was going on. All I want to do is sleep. I go to work, I make food, I sleep, I make food, and I go back to work.

And now I get to watch her grow fat with another baby while I cant even try to have one with my husband, and while I'm not even sure if my husband will be alive to help me raise any other children. 

So what all this leads up to; did you find therapy helpful? I'm not resistant, exactly - it's just that I don't want to do anything but work and sleep and play with my little boy and husband. Therapy won't keep my husband's cancer from coming back and it won't bring back my baby. I talk about my concerns and issues with family and friends; will a therapist help so much more that it's worth giving up time with my family?",2016-12-14 08:04:55

I just wanted to let you know that I just started a new sub for cancer survivors and their loved ones recently. 

Our definition of a cancer survivor is just someone who has been diagnosed with cancer at some point. So people who are in-treatment and post-treatment are welcome. If you are a caregiver, or you have someone in your life who has been diagnosed with cancer and you'd like some insight as to what they might be going through, please feel free to stop by and post a question or comment. My goal for this sub is for it to be a place where cancer survivors and their loved ones to support each other, find resources, ask questions, and get answers about all this craziness. 

Lets all support each other through, and after a cancer diagnosis. Hopefully we can help each other along this journey, and make it a little easier for everyone. I just want everyone to know that they aren't alone in this, and that there are other people out there who want to reach out to you, and support you, and who understand what you're going through because they've been there themselves.  

Please feel free to stop by, even if it's just to read the discussion. We'd love to have you. 

And a big thank you to TeacherTish for allowing me to post on your sub! You're awesome, and I'm really glad that you made a sub so that other caregivers have a place to connect to one another.

Just need to rant...,5,3f427k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/3f427k/just_need_to_rant/,4,1438252881.0,"This weekend one of my best friends is getting married. I'm so excited for her wedding, but as I sit here trying to write my speech for the reception I can't help but remember the last time I was MoH for my friend who has since died. I know the wedding will be an emotional time for me and the bride (as mine was) because we will he missing Lindsey.

I'm having an extra hard time, though, because my husband is so anxious about the wedding and our trip to visit family out of state after. He just started new meds and they're doubling the dose right before we go.  He's had some fatigue and thinks he's going to be tired.  Plus he's going to have to take this pill at the wedding because he has to take it at the same time each day. 
I know it's selfish, but I'm worried he's going to ruin the vacation. Last time we tried to go away for a mini-honeymoon weekend and his anxiety was so bad we barely left the hotel (and not in the good way lol).  I need some rest and relaxation and I want some fun time with him before I start back up with work in the fall and before his medical stuff gets more complicated  (he needs eye surgery and may be starting a trial). 

But there's no way for me to tell him this. I can't tell him to just suck it up for a week because cancer isn't going away. His medication isn't going away. And I'll just be a horrible person for making it about me.  So instead I'm going to rant on here and cry a little more and then put a smile on my face and hope we have fun.",2015-07-30 10:41:21

My grandma passed away from colon cancer several years ago. I saw my mom do anything, everything, and sacrifice everything for my grandma. So I know some of what to expect, but, I also don't know what to expect. 

This girl is so amazing and I want to be by her side and fight this with her. I've told her and have been honest with her that I'm committed to her and that I want to be with her. I'm not going anywhere. I know that she is scared, nervous, and frightened. I don't believe she has a huge support system in this fight though. I think she is afraid that I'm just going to leave her. She has very. strong feelings for me as well. 

So all in all what I'm trying to say is that I'm going to be a caregiver to a beautiful girl and that I hope we find a cure! Strides are being made everyday! We need to be there for the ones we love. Is it going to be hard? Yes. But we need to be strong for our loved ones and give them the support they need! Cancer sucks and F*** cancer! ",2015-07-19 14:47:09
Husband having major surgery on July 14th,3,3biwow,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/3biwow/husband_having_major_surgery_on_july_14th/,8,1435624136.0,"My SO and I married on June 18th (11 days ago) in front of a judge in a courtroom in a small town. We've been together for nearly 4 years; living together for 2 years August. 

He was diagnosed with Stage 3A colon cancer in July 2013. He nearly died in the process. 9 days obstructed. 13 days in the hospital. Life saving resection surgery late in the night with only me there. 5 feet of large intestine removed. (No colostomy bag though!) Large tumor removed. 21 lymph nodes removed - 2 were cancerous. 

All at 40 years old. 

After, I moved in to his home with my daughters. He went through 7 months of intensive chemo. Finally in April 2014 he was considered 'cancer free'. 

He got back to work, back to golf, back to 'normal life'. We managed to return to a 'normal' sexual relationship - about once a week. 

By this January he was in considerable pain most of the time. He wasn't particularly honest or forthright in telling me that the cyst on his testicle was MUCH larger. 

During his quarterly oncologist appointment, his CEA blood test was creeping up. 

By March, they get CT scan and PET scan scheduled. Something suspicious on CT accelerates PET to immediate. 
Lymph node on PET is showing up bright yellow - like a Christmas tree light bulb. 

We're sent for a biopsy. They can't do the biopsy, due to it's proximity to his aorta. 

We get scheduled with a cancer specialist in a University hospital. That took 3 weeks. 
In the meantime, we find out his cyst(s) are benign, but are larger than his entire left testicle and need to be removed - AND are causing 70% of all his daily pain. 

His infusion port has 'flipped up' and needs to be removed and replaced. (Surgeon says in over 1000 ports installed, this only the 2x time he's ever seen this!)

His back tooth broke and he needs a crown. 

They can't do ANY of it until AFTER  they 'treat' his cancer reoccurrence or till they figure out HOW they are going to treat it. 

We finally meet the specialist. He immediately recommends surgery to remove the offending node. Probably chemo after. 

He can't schedule it though, until after the 'tumor board' where the surgeon and the radiologist confirm it can be safely removed. 

We get called 4 days later - on our wedding day - to hear the surgeon says Yes, he can remove it.  

The next week we meet the surgeon and his team. He informs us it's 2 lymph nodes, not one.  It's extremely invasive. They may need to remove more colon due to related arteries in the way. It's 3-4 days in the hospital. It's at least 3 days of no food at all. (Fucking ice chips again!!) 

We get it scheduled. 

We attend a family wedding this Sat on his side. He's the 10th of 11 children and the last to get married. They are very Catholic. Very. (We are not. He's an non religious, believer. I'm a respectful atheist.)

I'm the communicator, the organizer, the fixer of all things. I'm the comforter of the emotional. The provider of information. The source for answers to all questions. This wedding is HARD!  

I love my husband very much. I'm not angry at him or his family or mine or our  friends. 

I am angry though. Angry at cancer. Angry at the lack of help or support for either of us. 

Angry at 'prayers'. Everyone is 'praying' for us, and all I can think is ""Well, isn't that special. And lazy"". 

I'm strong and fiercely independent in normal circumstances. I'm capable and logical in a crisis. I compartmentalize well. 

So I'm bitching on reddit to anonymous strangers because I don't know where else to turn. 
There were no threads here and only 6 readers, so I expect I'm speaking into the void. 

.....................................


I miss sex. It's been months and it's going to be months more. 

I'm afraid for him. Afraid of surgery. Afraid they'll find more in his belly, or bladder - because they don't show up on the PET well. 

I'm lonely. I can't add to his burden, even as he tries so hard not to add to mine. 
My close family and friends know what's going on. I don't need to whine to them. 

I created a closed, and then Secret Facebook group for updates. I post very specific and clinical information. It's not a place to whine either. 
Really, I'm not into whining. Much. Often... 

I just need a break. A real break from all of this. 
I'm not going to get one. This is all I know.",2015-06-30 00:28:56

One is kicking the s\*\*\* out of their diagnosis and the other is doing an amazing job of supporting them. The issue is that the support person struggles with body functions and while they are rising to the occasion they are worried that they will not be able to return to the ""way it was"" physically due to the constant communication and descriptions of what is happening to their partner. They feel like they have gone from wife to nurse/friend and are worried about the transition back.

Also their diagnosis came within 6 months of them becoming an (amazing) parent so there is the added stress/craziness. I honestly believe that the convergence of joy and pain is the main issue and the candidness is how they are justifying things.

I assume all support groups are online these days so the region doesn't matter but does anyone have any ideas where a wife/new mother can meet people in a similar situation.

My mum lives with L, has done for pretty much all of L's life. L moved out for a while but missed my mum, so they moved in together, along with L's husband and child and still live together now with L's 3 children and another from her husbands previous relationship. That has meant that as my mum needed more care as she grew older and sicker, L has done it. 
.
In the last few months we have discovered that my mum has cancer of the colon, liver and lungs and it is terminal. She is a walking miracle and has been through some awful shit. She requires more care now, and doesnt want carers so we are doing it. At first me and L and K were all doing night shifts while A was there for a bit during the day (being a man, neither he or my mum is comfortable with him doing personal care). However after a week K decided it was too much for her and she couldn't do night shifts, so it went to me and L doing alternate nights, while K visited during the day to give L some time for her children and me some time for my life. That went on for a few weeks, then L said to change it to 2 nights off 1 night on for me, as she said that she was used to taking care of my mum anyway so I agreed. However, the shifts keep getting longer, i.e. someone will call and ask me to come earlier and I'll end up staying much later the following day. I don't sleep and I am shattered by the time I do get home. Last week L's husband was struggling to cope so she sent him to stay with his parents so I was there even more often and for longer trying to help out. 

Now K has an operation and has to self isolate for a week or whatever and then will be recovering for 4 weeks so cant do the daily visits. So L has asked me continue doing my night shifts which she says are 8 til 8 which they never are, while also coming round and spending the whole following day. I know that she does a lot and that this doesnt seem like a lot in comparison but to be honest I'm tearing up just thinking about it. 

For L, other than the whole cancer thing, in her words not much has changed except that she has to do personal care with my mum. For me, I've given up my whole life. I am married and we have been trying for a baby, in fact I had miscarriages numbers 4 and 5 this year. I've been off sick since the last one because I'm struggling with how to pull myself back from that and now I've got to face losing my mum as well. Not to mention that it is fairly likely (but fingers crossed and touch every piece of wood on the planet that I'm wrong) that A has bone cancer. 

I feel like I'm going out of my mind and I know its selfish (hence why no named names, cos if they find this, I dont know how I'd react) but I'm struggling to cope. I know that L's expectations probably are not unreasonable but they feel that way to me. I just feel like no matter what I do, it is NEVER ENOUGH.  Even when I meet them, they are higher the next time. What do I do?",2020-10-29 12:50:28

Yes, I know that is poo-ish and I suck.

Quick back story - we had issues abut a year or more before her diagnosis.  Which kinda stemmed around not getting pregnant when trying for a child.  We tried and were about to seek medical when she just shut down she was diagnosed with LMS (Leiomyosarcoma) about a year later.

I get the mental part of not being able to have kids, yet at the time no Dr. said she couldn't.  Then came the news.  Since then, about 4 years, even tho she is able to do many things...party...go on trips etc. zero sex.

I've addressed it and it just ends in a fight.  Am I wrong to kinda wanna make love to my wife?

It's driving a huge wedge and I don't want to be the guy who left a sick spouse behind, but I'm needing some stuff for me as well.  

I don't want to come off as <insert anything here> I'm a combat vet - know the sacrifice of being the leader in combat and marriage...but the old question of what about me???

It was just dad and me taking care of her, dad is 73 and it was hard on him as well.

I was very close to her, she is my role  model, she was a fighter, i tried to be there for her, i was her caregiver from February, was by her side the whole time, during the lockdown, until June, that's when the complications began, she was in the hospital nearly 40 days, was very difficult because of the pandemic and restrictions but we managed. Towards the end, we brought her home, did hospice at home, we had someone take care of her, i was helping out occasionally but was not too involved during that period.

After she passed away, the first 3 days i didnt even feel any emotions, didn't really have any thoughts either, my mind was blank, numb maybe, no tears, the tears started after that, something random will bring up some thought or memory and i break into tears, but most of the time i am normal, also had so much to do those first few days that i think i was distracted.

Now though, i feel very disturbed, i am having nightmares, havent been able to sleep the past few nights, i don't feel so good, i can't really express it but i'm not okay. Even during the day, i go around doing things like everything is normal, but not feeling okay. I want to feel better though. I miss her, i have dreams where I feel like i'm longing for her, but also some that are not so good.

Any of you who have been through this, how did you handle it? Does it get better, is this how it is? Should I seek psychological help? Do sleep meds help?",2020-09-06 06:42:42

It started with serious eye/vision issues related to his disease (which surgeries and treatment have helped - he can now drive again on most days, though he has trouble at night or if it’s very dark/rainy). From there it was one treatment after another with a few months of normalcy in between. 

Last year at this time he started a new treatment called PRRT after three weeks of hospitalization. He just got his 6 month scan and it’s very promising with no disease progression. This treatment keeps working for months to years so he’s looking at (likely) a stretch of at least a year. In addition, his pain has come down and he has been able to stop taking pain medications. These combined have him feeling like he should work and contribute to the household/society. 

He never had a career. He was diagnosed with cancer only a few years out of college and the field he was working in is no longer one he’s interested in. It also involves tasks he’s not able to do anymore, such as restraining others, sitting on the floor, frequent driving, etc. 

I don’t know what the point of this post is, but I guess I’m trying to find resources for him to help find a) what kind of jobs he could potentially work or b) job training resources. I’d also like to hear anyone’s experiences with going back to work after cancer or with cancer. 

My husband will never be free of disease and is not looking to start a career, but he wants a job that gives him meaning.

I don't know where to start, so I will make it short:
was born with optic nerve glioma. Got chemo for a while. It helped, but the tumor was inoperable due to his location direct at the optic nerve (so he's still kinda there, but veeeery small and inactive, dead?).
Had to go to MRT and some other stuff ever year for 19 years.

Now I am 19 years old and fortunately the disease didn't come back, but recently I wanted to gain more information about it, because my parents and I didn't and don't speak much about it.

I found out that only malignant tumors are called cancer (mine was *benign*).
So I am totally confused, angry, and sad(?) right now.

All the years I thought that I had cancer. I identified myself as a cancer survivor and I was proud of it.
It helped me through hard times, to motivate myself again. And now I found out that it wasn't cancer?!?wtf...

Don't get me wrong: I am really happy that I ""only"" had a benign tumor instead of a malignant one and I know that benign ones can also be very dangerous and life-threatening/-changing.

So: Are tumor survivors considered cancer survivors or are they their own thing?
I don't get it...

Just to clarify, earlier this week my dad was suffering from pain, sickness, diarrhea, extreme tiredness etc. A family member mentioned it might be signs of end of life hence my post here. Since then he has actually got much better, we are guessing a bug, but of course, my mind went into overdrive. 

So, today he got his latest CT scan results from the hospital. He has stage 4 pancreatic and liver cancer. When diagnosed at stage 4 the consultant said 'we will only treat this cancer for 6 months and your life is counted in months, not years'. 

HOWEVER, his latest scan results show his liver tumour has shrunk to only 5mm and his pancreatic tumour has shrunk, slightly, but still! 

We are in the UK so under NHS. Although his tumours have shrunk they are still refusing to give further chemotherapy. 

I understand it affects the immune system etc but I just can't understand how if 1 of his tumours is only 5mm away from clearing why they wouldn't carry on. 

He's okay otherwise. His bug or whatever it was has cleared, he has no other symptoms really, bit of pain sometimes.

I am a 25 year old female who is recently married (just over a year). My father in law was diagnosed with stage 3 esophageal carcinoma and has just finished his last week of chemo and radiation. He had to spend the last week in the hospital because he was so weak and couldn’t keep anything down. When he was diagnosed my husband flew to him (we live in MD and he was in AL). Upon receiving the diagnosis we knew what we had to do. We opened our home and our arms to him and moved him in within the next few days. It’s been a really tough transition for all of us, but I always feel guilty when I think of the hardships I’m going through. We are newly married and just moved into our dream home, when within two weeks, we got the diagnosis of his father. I love my father in law very much and am so glad I am able to help him, it’s just been super tough for me. His mood swings and temperament towards me has been nothing but unpleasant. 

Anyways, Wednesday was his last chemo treatment and he’s been home since Friday. He’s incredibly weak and spends most of the day sleeping or vomiting (multiple times a day) or being unable to control his bowels. I’ve dealt with my grandmother going through chemo but I don’t remember dealing with this. I know everyone’s experience with chemo is different, but this feels....wrong. He looks worse now than when we first took him to the hospital over a week ago. He can barely stand on his own and my husband has to help to the bathroom. Has anyone else gone through this?

My sister I've been distant with although she lives in the house with my elderly mother.  I don't know what to do because I have my own issues and am chronically suicidal.  I feel as the youngest and smartest I should be taking on the charge.  But my family are Jehovah's Witnesses so the medical things are a problem.  Is it okay to just try your best even if your best is almost nothing?  Like I'd rather go hang out with a friend than visit her. The emotions are too much.,2019-09-19 23:30:32
Missing support from work/colleagues,3,d3ohhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/d3ohhs/missing_support_from_workcolleagues/,5,1568406309.0,"Hi all,
My mom was recently diagnosed with terminal cancer and likely does not have long left (prognosis is less than a year). I naturally want to spend as much time with her as possible and my employer has so far been nice and will let me work from home to take care of her. While I am of course grateful that I get this opportunity, I am quite disappointed with the lack of sympathy they are showing. Quite a few of my colleagues and bosses know my mom is very sick, but not one of them has asked my how she is doing or how I am doing with all of this. Last week I was in the office with all my colleagues, and not a single person gave me the impression that they are even aware my family and I are going through this crisis. 

Is this to be expected? Is it considered taboo to talk about cancer? Are they worried I will be upset and break down crying? 

I am generally a very open person and it hurts my trying to act as if everything is fine at work and just going about my business, but perhaps I am just overreacting.",2019-09-13 20:25:09

My wife (we've been married 6 years) found an odd lump in her breast, near the armpit. Today she got it checked out by a doctor and has been referred to a breast examination clinic which will be a couple of weeks away. Her own mother died early from breast cancer too. We have two kids, 4 and 1.

I've researched a bit and they say that the majority of lumps are not cancer at all. Even then, advancements have been made since my wife's mother in law and survival rates are improving all the time. But I don't know, I think my mind just goes to the worst possible scenario. My wife is my best friend, and I can't stand thinking of the pain, both physical and emotional, she could be potentially facing. She's 10 times the parent I am, I don't know how I'd cope. I can't handle the possibility that she might not see our daughter and son grow up.

Changing jobs while both parents have cancer. Should I risk losing FMLA?,3,c1eshd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/c1eshd/changing_jobs_while_both_parents_have_cancer/,1,1560747099.0," 

Anyone  ever change jobs while in the midst of supporting a close loved one  with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer?  Any tips or advice?  My mom has Stage 4  PC, and I work as a nurse in a nursing home.  My father also is sick  with cancer.  Between work and then coming home to help my parents who  are sick, I feel like death follows me everywhere I go and I feel like a  change of scene would be helpful.  I can't change that my parents are  sick but I can change my job.   However... I will lose my rights to FMLA  and I have no guarantees that a new employer will be sympathetic and  allow time off to help my parents and we all know how unpredictable  Stage IV PC is.  My mom is doing great on Gemzar and Abraxane and is  going 9 months strong, but we all know the statistics that only 80% live to 1 year and few beat the  odds.

But  I really am dying to reduce the time I spend every week caring for  people who are essentially dying.  It is too much.   I am just faking it at work because I am just FRIED.  So here I am... and I  have been asked to interview in a nursing position at an insurance  company, which sounds amazing.  And yet a new job would mean losing the  stability of my current job, where I can basically leave anytime I need  to without issue, and where I will get 5 days of bereavement leave when  my parents pass.  My current job is a good job if it weren't hitting just too close  to home these days.  Anyone else ever go through this?  Advice?",2019-06-17 04:51:39

Super anxious waiting on test results,3,awt5v3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/awt5v3/super_anxious_waiting_on_test_results/,3,1551640950.0,"So I guess a little back story:

Almost exactly a year ago my boyfriend (age 27 at the time) was diagnosed with stage 3 testicular cancer (seminoma). He had a huge mass in his stomach, along with a mass in the lymph nodes in his neck, and lesions on his lungs. He went through chemo for 9 weeks. Everything went great and he was in remission. But, They had to delay his testicle removal surgery due to a blood clot. 

During the delay on the surgery I started noticing old symptoms coming back. After more scans, his oncologist said that not only was the cancer back, but it had spread to a spot on his spine. Surgery was finally scheduled, and then more chemo was scheduled to follow shortly after. 

He finished his VeIP chemo about a month ago now. His tumor markers have appeared fine and he appears to be the best he has in six months. We find out on Tuesday whether everything is good or whether he needs the stem cell transplant. I am worried sick. So anxious all the time. I feel like our world is finally going back to normal again and it could easily flip upside down in a few days. 

I am only 23 and have been there for him as much as I could be. I would go from work to school to the hospital to sleep in a shitty chair five nights a weeks during his last chemo. I would do all the cooking and all the cleaning at our apt when we were finally out of the hospital. I feel like I was becoming so drained this last time around that I can’t imagine how I would be for the next treatment. Especially since it would be 3 weeks in the hospital at a time. 

I would be there 24/7 for him if I could, but it’s just not realistic with work and school. 

I guess I don’t really have a point to this post other than needing to vent because my mind has been racing all night. It just sucks so much. ",2019-03-03 19:22:30

My dad was much more coherent during Thanksgiving and I had no trouble making dinner on that Friday and going to a friends with him for dinner on Thanksgiving Day.

My dad has declined— the nurse thinks the cancer has metastasized to his brain. He gets confused about things and has been having hallucinations. He still eats and recognizes people and generally understands what is going on. I am the primary care giver but my uncle has been staying with me since last Thursday. 

I’m pretty exhausted as his most recent weekend consisted of wetting the bed multiple times a night, restless during the day along with some agitation. We have a 2 story house and he insisted on going up and down the stairs to his bed or back down to the living room every hour or so. Needed the help of a baby monitor for that one. (I know his bed should be moved and maybe he should even have a hospital bed, but my dad says “not yet”.)

Christmas has normally been a holiday we celebrate at our house. We used to have so many decorations up and of course a tree. This year I have done absolutely nothing to make this house look like Christmas cheer.  I kind feel like trash for not doing anything. Christmas is next week but I don’t know how my father will be then. There’s New Years. Our birthdays are next month too: I’m turning 30 and my dad will turn 68.

Even using the cane is a constant fight and she 'forgets' it to use it around the house because she doesn't like it. I ordered her a new walker that fixed all of the complaints with her other one in hopes that she might actually use it. She said she would and liked it more, but she has only used it once and yelled at me when I said I was putting it in the car just in case when we went to the store. Well the other day she fell while using the cane and broke her hip. I finally said enough and told her she could not use it anymore and had to use a walker after she got cleared from the hospital. She yelled at me and said she was fine with the cane....after they told her she broke her hip at the ER. She's still there and will probably be for a while more, but my fear is a repeat of this when she gets home (she's fallen several times and it's a miracle that she didn't break anything sooner). I've tried casually mentioning it so it might feel like her idea, I've tried a new walker that has none of the issues she complained about the other walker and played it up as a fun new toy, I've tried just flat out saying enough. She just gives me grief and keeps doing whatever she wants when she thinks I'm not looking (I can't watch her 24hr a day - I have to sleep some time). She has already proven that she will do this after getting minor injuries from falls and such in the past, so I'm running out of ideas to keep her from hurting herself. A wheelchair will turn into WW3, but the new walker converts into a transport chair which was helpful at the hospital before the was admitted.   


I'm feeling like I just won't be able to keep doing this for much longer. It's been about 6 years since her Stage 4 breast cancer diagnosis, and she's gone downhill fast this past year - my father died from lung cancer a couple years before her diagnosis, and I'm an only child. She won't let anybody else do anything for her but me (my husband does whatever he can, but she won't let him do hardly anything but go get food, and she refuses to let our friends help when they offer), and I'm about shot with caregiving and the constant fights of keeping her from being seriously hurt on top of everything else. I hate to say it, but it's been a relief having her at the hospital right now as she tends to follow advice from medical professionals even if they say the exact same thing she gave me a hard time over. She's still texting and calling me when we're not at the hospital, so I'm still having to stop everything regularly, but I'm not having to worry about her getting hurt from doing something she shouldn't because I'm not right there.",2018-10-06 11:22:18

Infertility and Cancer,3,7pfyit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/7pfyit/infertility_and_cancer/,9,1515623915.0,"This is a topic that has been causing me a lot of anxiety over the past couple years.

My husband is incurable, but probably has ""some years"" ahead of him according to the doctors. He is on maintenance chemo, and having biological children is out of the question. Even if he is still fertile after the chemo and radiation he had years ago, the maintenance chemo would most likely cause birth defects and complications.

I always said I was fine with not having children of our own. I stand by that point. I love children and always planned to have children, but also always considered adopting or being a foster parent. I also worked with kids all day and did not have the emotional energy needed to be a good parent.

However, now I have a new career that is MUCH less stressful. In addition, I'm going to be making more money (although it would still be tight if we had a child). I'm also getting older and I can just feel my biological clock. I know this all sounds ridiculous, but my SIL is having a baby girl and so is a good friend. Just this last two weeks I've had three other friends announce their pregnancies. Every time I see this it's like a stab in my chest. I never used to feel this way. I started crying at work when someone was showing off their three month old daughter. 

I've looked into it and because my husband is terminal, we are unable to foster. If we wanted to adopt, it would be a difficult and expensive process and even then we may not be successful. In addition, do I really want to put a child through losing their parent? Especially a child who has already gone through so much to end up needing adoption?

I feel so selfish, but I don't know how to move forward. I feel myself pulling back from my husband and avoiding intimacy because all it does is give my body hope which means a whole month of pregnancy dreams...

Basically, my brain knows that having children would not be a good idea. It would be too much stress on the child, my husband is extremely anxious and would have difficulty with a child, and we don't have the finances to provide the kind of life I would want. But I don't know how to stop myself from having these extreme emotional reactions to all of the babies/mothers around me. I don't know how to stop my dreams.

cant seem to convince her to even think about western approach to cancer...

I feel I caused my boyfriend's cancer.,3,77bbl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/77bbl1/i_feel_i_caused_my_boyfriends_cancer/,20,1508405760.0,"It feels like I am causing my boyfriend's cancer... a scary thought. Also, I am afraid my boyfriend is using his cancer as a desperate way to keep me around.

1. He got a small tumor (doctor did not know it was cancer yet) the year he and I started texting. The tumor caused him nausea and lightheadedness, I believe. He didn't tell me about it until a month after we were dating. We have been dating on and off starting in July / September. He said he found out his tumor was cancerous: a pea-sized astrocytoma. Shortly after he got started on chemo therapy, I moved in with him to comfort him and help him sleep because he says he cannot sleep more than a few hours a night without me. He also says he cannot jerk off because he cannot orgasm without me. It seemed kind of strange here and there.

2. He spat blood in the shower one rare time I would not join him. The next time I did not join him, he was being dramatic and vocal: talking aloud to himself at a slightly raised volume so that I could coincidentally hear him. It screams ""give me attention"".

3. He spits blood often on nights that I do not text him while he is at work.

4. He spits blood immediately after he sees me accidentally looking at a muscular guy on computer. This is just too much of a coincidence.

5. He won't let me be near when he vomits, I have never heard him wretch, I've never seen him vomit blood until he has already been doing it for a while, and he won't let me be there during his chemo IV... seems fishy. It seems like he is hiding something.
 
He does not have one of those IV ports for getting chemo. Wouldn't the chemo destroy his veins if he didn't have one?

Before he was on chemo and before I knew he had cancer, when sensing our relationship was at an end, he would go into a manic episode where he would basically need help walking so he could lay down. I eventually did break up with him over text because I know I am easily swayed by emotions in person. I got back together with him later.

I am super emotionally-sensitive and everyone says I am naive. I kind of have a record of being the most naive person imaginable, but I'm trying to be careful and do the right thing for my boyfriend. I feel emotionally exhausted and in defense mode, so maybe I'm being paranoid.

* How illogical is it for someone to cause someone's cancer?

* What are the chances my boyfriend is faking cancer to make me stay in the relationship or to get attention?",2017-10-19 09:36:00

Let me start with this: 

My mother was diagnosed with Stage IV Ovarian Cancer last year in January. It's spread... well, everywhere. Lungs, liver, intestines, parts of her spine. The morbid part of me is just waiting for it to inevitably spread to her brain if it hasn't already (and the insurance company keeps refusing the PET Scan, joys). She's on her 5th set of combination chemo (Taxol/Avastin), after already trying various others including Cystoplatin and Doxol. This is actually her second time using Taxol.

She has trouble eating. A lot. It's at the point where she's lost 5 pounds in just 3-4 days because she says she can't, because she feels full all the time. And what little she does eat, ends up getting thrown back up. Even after taking Zofran. She can't even eat something mush like porridge or mashed potatoes (barring how much she hates the texture of both and related foods).

I'm not sure what else I can do. This is but one of many issues, but it's also the biggest one. She can't get better or stronger without eating. But short of admitting her to a hospital for malnutrition — which she will vehemently refuse and have a panic attack over — I'm not sure what can be done. She used to love food, and now she can barely touch it. I'll never forgive myself if she ends up starving to death because of this shit-tier disease.

Does anyone have any suggestions?",2017-08-04 13:23:21

It's been a rollercoaster since then of scanxiety, targeted gene therapies, radiation, etc. Bad news then good news then bad news again. I'm only 31; he is 42.

I already deal with severe anxiety/panic disorder and depression, which has gotten way worse while dealing with his situation. I am not cut out to be a caretaker - sickness makes me want to run and hide, and I can barely deal with my own issues, especially with everything going on in the world right now. My partner and I were engaged at one point (he proposed about a month or two after his diagnosis) but I called off the wedding because it was too much stress for me.

I thought I had a great support group though. But lately ALL my close local friends have been MIA - and I don't know if it is because of my partner's situation, subconsciously or not. I'm not even the kind of person who is moping about when we hang out or constantly talking about cancer stuff - I like to have a good time and need the distraction from all that. So I don't think my company is a downer or anything, unless the very fact that he has cancer freaks them out (even if I don't bring it up and seem cheerful) and they don't know how to deal with it? I don't know.

I expect this kind of thing from acquaintances, I guess, but not my very best friends. I am desperately lonely all the time now, and wish they would be there to support me (us) when I need it the most. My messages and texts are getting ignored most of the time, not responded to for days. I don't know what to do. It's physically painful...

I guess this is mostly just a venting rant. If anyone has advice, that would be great. I just feel like I am at the end of my rope sometimes. I don't even have the romantic relationship I once did. It's like I am in limbo and this constant state of high stress for the past almost 2 years... It's just not sustainable.",2017-06-08 12:16:23

I just try to brush it off, ""My students keep me plenty busy!"" Or ""I have my nephew to keep me on my toes."" But these people will just keep going!

He pretty much only leaves the house for doctor's appointments and errands. The last 6 months or so it's a chore to get him to do anything.

I'm having to force him to go to family events like his nephew's birthday party and Christmas Eve. 

Besides this being unhealthy for him, it's really wearing me down. I feel like a jerk for trying to do fun things for him. I am missing out on things I want to do because he waits until the last second to back out and I can't make alternate plans. 

We've been planning to go to Boston for a hockey game since the summer. It's my dad's treat. It's also the anniversary of our engagement (which happened in Boston) and I've been looking forward to it for months. Not today he's saying he didn't feel up for it. He just went to the doctors today and all his scans are fine. The APRN mentioned, though, that he should try to see the cardiologist maybe instead of going to Boston. The cardiologist can't see him anyways, but now he's decided that the APRN thought it was too risky for him to go out for the night. 

I think he just doesn't want to go. But I'm going to be a selfish bitch if I make him go and he's miserable and in pain the whole time.

February of 2014 he went to check in with his oncologist and found out the cancer was back. Has it in every lymph node. At the time my dad didn't want to do any type of treatment as ""he felt fine"". Still continued working. December of 2015, I got onto him about getting himself checked out. He was having difficulty walking and was wheezing. (He was also very overweight and has high blood pressure, blamed those symptoms on his medicine).  

Fast forward to October 2016. There were some issues with his prostate and bladder, went to the doctor and his WBC levels are over 20,000. Cancer is raging. 2 weeks later finally got a PET scan not only is the lymphoma in every lymph node but also his liver, spinal cord and bone marrow. Thankfully the cancer hasn't mutated but it still could.  

Went to visit my parents over Christmas. He's lost 70lbs and looks awful. He hasn't even started treatment yet and I'm worried that this is only going to get worse. My dad is his own boss and still believes he can work. He isn't eating meat, just hot and sour soup from different local Chinese places. I'm afraid he's malnourished and secretly trying to kill himself by only eating 1,000 calories or less a day. Medicaid just denied his chemo treatment for the second time and the out of pocket cost is $13,000 for these chemo pills.

Because he is home all day, but not completely incapacitated (the disability was more due to vision/his particular job being risky), he had been doing most of the daily chores around the house. He does the grocery shopping, over half the cooking, loaded dishwasher, his laundry, and takes care of the dog and garbage.

I worked, tutored, babysat, did my laundry, unloaded the dishwasher, vacuumed and did the bathroom on the weekends, and cooked the remaining meals.  

It was a great system.  Everything was pretty equally distributed and everything got done.

But now he was in the hospital all last week for unexplained pain.  The pain is making his fatigue worse, and also (obviously) making him extremely uncomfortable. When he takes the pain pills, he becomes very dizzy and disoriented and often naps. As such, we're trying to come up with a new symptom until his pain recedes.

How have you handled household chores? It would be unrealistic for me to do everything with my schedule (I often work 50+ hours a week before my extra jobs).

I am currently collecting data for my dissertation, which focuses on the shared experience of distress and coping among adolescent and young oncology patients (with any cancer) and their caregivers. This information is important for helping identify and create resources to help patients and their caregivers manage their distress. This survey study is being conducted online and has been approved by the East Carolina University Institutional Review Board. The survey should take approximately 10 - 20 minutes to complete. Participants will be entered into a raffle for one of $10 gift cards to Amazon.

This study is aimed at recruiting caregivers that meet the following criteria:
*Are at least 18 years of age
*Are currently or have within the past two years a caregiver (an individual that has provided substantial practical, emotional, social or financial support) to an AYA diagnosed with cancer while the individual underwent treatment.
*The AYA was between the ages of 16 and 39 when diagnosed and is currently between the ages of 18 and 41.
*Has never themselves had cancer.

Please let me know if there is any additional information that I can provide. I'm happy to answer any questions that individuals have either here or you can email me at kolobovai13@students.ecu.edu
Thank you so much for interest and participation.

Thankfully, I have not had a parallel situation that makes much of this easily relatable in my  own life.

At this stage, the doctors said going through treatment would not be beneficial to him and they will just help him manage the pain at this point. The docs gave him 3 months to live. 

He has no wife, no children, and really no friends. He's been pretty ""nomadic"" during his life and has never put down any roots. My Mom made the decision to take him in to her home and care for him. 

She did this with her mother when her health was failing a few years back. It was VERY stressful and eventually her care became to involved and she had to go to a nursing facility. She has since passed away. 

Anyway, my husband and I went to visit this weekend and my uncle's condition is rapidly declining. They do have hospice for him and they have been wonderful with assisting in his care and providing support to my mom as well. It was a hard 2 days for everyone. My mom is so overwhelmed and I feel like I need to do something to support her....I just don't know what to do other than be there for her. I live over an hour away, so ""pop in visits"" aren't really an option. She was really down on herself and saying that she feels like she just can't handle it. She feels like she isn't doing enough and we've reassured her that she is doing a GREAT job. 

My mom is a complicated person and so is my relationship with her. She has depression and anxiety and this is just wearing on her so much. 

Any recommendations on actions I can take as her daughter? I'm also interested in any books that might be out there for care givers as a little ""pick me up"" for her.

The days she doesn't get out of bed until noon when she had gone to bed at 9 or 10 the night before.

She is no longer undergoing any medical intervention to control the growth of her current tumor. Her plan is to go into hospice next month. 

It seems that she is continuing to wrap up her affairs and with that she is shutting down her relationships. She speaks to a small group of confidants but that group does not include me or her children. The energy she does appear to have symptom free throughout the day is spent on herself sometimes just a few hours of TV. The kids don't understand, how can they? At this point it seems like when the time comes that she is truly sick her actions will seem justified.  She is making it very difficult and at this point there will be a huge sense of relief once she passes.

She's had multiple surgeries as well as radiation and chemo. At this point all of her deficits were byproducts of  medical treatments and not the cancer itself. She has grown tired of losing herself to the treatments and has stopped her chemo that was only keeping the tumor from growing. She is starting to experience some symptoms from the tumor but it's slight. 

She has enough energy and interest to do the things that she wants and unfortunately that ultimately benefit herself. Expectations on her around the house are zero but with young kids and a full time job any help would be appreciated. I think the worse part is that this work extends to her relationships. She is not investing or doing her part in our relationship but I'm an adult and can understand the why and show her grace. The kids are more and more frustrated because she is turning into a really bad mother and they do not understand. They know she is sick but they see she is able to do things for herself and just seem to care less and less about them. They are pulling away, she is getting more angry and selfish, and the cycle seems to be escalating. 

The kids and I at this point are just getting by but things are really not good and she adds so much tension to the house.",2020-11-02 14:28:55

He has been given heavy chemo treatments, and its taking a serious toll on him. **He was already a small kid, at around 4""3 inches,** ***maybe*** **4""4, weighing probably 55 pounds**. Since he started chemo, he's gotten smaller. I don't mean just like he's lost weight, I mean he literally, got smaller. He is about 3""8 now, maybe 3""9, weighing probably high thirties? None of his clothes really fit him. Is that a common or normal thing? **I don't feel comfortable talking to the doctors since I feel that's my parent's place, not mine**. I'm only a few years older than him, but its weird, because his height and facial features make him look younger. **He looked about 9, now he looks 6-7, but at the same time, his deathly pale/green skin tone and deep set, sunken eyes make him look old, and like he's seen things people won't see in three lifetimes**. Such hurt in his eyes, its hard for me to look at him in the eyes, which only hurts him. If he eats **ANYTHING**, its almost guaranteed he'll spend the next hour or two vomiting. And then comes diarrhea after that. I'm also worried, because he started doing this thing where he just spaces out at times, like no one is there. He doesn't realize anything. **He doesn't hear us, doesn't feel us if we touch him, just sits there looking forward blankly, looking scared or in pain**. I can throw my hand a centimetre from his face and he won't realize. I've held his hand, hugged him, cried into his shoulder, did anything to pull him out of his trance whenever he gets into it, but nothing works and he just stares right through us like we aren't there. Once it starts, we just have to wait it out. **He's in his own world**. Is that normal for kids? I'm assuming its either his brain choosing to live in itself, and not the real world, as a self defense mechanism, or maybe its just his body trying to save energy? Please let me know, thanks.

My wife finished breast cancer treatment about a year ago. At the time we knew she had a brain tumor, but we were in China and wanted it treated in the US. Fast forward to Thursday and my wife had a seizure because the tumor had grown and was pressing on her brain stem. They did a CT and MRI of her spine and found mets. The oncologist called them marrow replacing lesions. There was also an alarming amount of fluid around her lung. They removed 800 ml, but said there was more. They said this is a sign of mets around her lungs, but stopped short of saying mets are definitely there. 

Friday they did the craniotomy and removed the tumor. Everything went smoothly and my wife is recovering now. We are expecting to get the pathology report back Monday or Tuesday this week. Once it's finished I will talk with the oncologist and neurology team about what the next step will be. The problem is, I am totally out of my depth. I've been looking at treatment stuff online and writing down questions to ask. 

Does anyone have advice for what to ask?",2019-07-15 03:18:17

This time we are not sure what treatment she can actually have as it is looking like surgery and radiation are not viable, but regardless, I know times will be tough again. 
I want to help as much as I can but financially I can’t do it alone. And neither can she.

Had to do this for Mom as she has bought about 4 pay channels either thinking they were included, or by getting confused and pressing random buttons on the remote.

I was able to catch a couple of the purchases, but some made it through and already charged her for the month. This setting has already been incredibly helpful as it has let her know she was about to purchase stuff several times just today, and I don't need to regularly monitor her subscriptions anymore.

We have been married forever, as in 30+ years.  Two months ago, he found a lump in his neck. He had been getting his teeth worked on and he thought it might be an abscess from one of them, but it didn't hurt.  After fighting with the VA about getting in to see a dentist, getting a cat scan, biopsy, on and on, he finally had a ultrasound biopsy two weeks ago, where it looked like it was just an abscess as when the needle went in, they started pulling what looked like pus out and the tumor collapsed.  Or so we thought.

On Thursday, they called and said they needed to see us THAT DAY.  Yeah, my thought was ""it is cancer"" but they said it was an abscess, so...nah. It's Squamous Cell carcinoma, likely metastasis from someone else.

Hubby will not discuss this. Does NOT want to talk about it, I read the path report online, and he asked me what it said so I told him. He is NOT dealing with it well.  I am scared, I feel this time is different, but have been caregiving for all this time now and won't back down, but I have no one to talk to.  

Told my sons and my ex DIL, and she promptly made it ALL about her, which is one reason she is ex, she called my son, her ex, up and exploded in tears and everything causing him to freak out.

It seems like everything he tries to eat irritates his throat and he starts coughing and then usually gives up trying to continue eating.
I know once he starts eating and his body starts to heal there’s a good chance his taste buds might come back. (The doctors emphasize MIGHT, but I’m hopeful)

My husband is currently on his second round of chemo for Stage IV colorectal cancer. He has a 48-hour pump that is getting disconnected today. During his first round he got a bit of chemo brain, but this round he's been foggy nearly the whole time. 

He's bored and extremely frustrated that he can't keep track of what he's doing. We live on the west coast, so we can't go outside due to the smoke. He's tried sewing masks, reading, or watching TV, but it makes him more frustrated. He tried to watch his favorite movie yesterday, and it took him several hours. 

Does anyone have suggestions on how to get through it at home? We're currently trying a Star Wars marathon, but he wanders a lot. I suggested coloring while the movies are on. 

He's also worried that chemo brain will get worse with every round. In your experience, has the level of fogginess been variable with treatments?

Thank you! (Cross-posted)",2020-09-13 02:00:39

Health took a sudden turn,1,g4capn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/g4capn/health_took_a_sudden_turn/,1,1587348426.0,"Hi Everyone,

I’ve posted here a few times before. My FIL was diagnosed with esophageal carcinoma last May and has since gone through the treatment and had surgery to remove the cancer from his esophagus. It’s been about 10 weeks since the surgery and he’s been back to the hospital twice due to complications. His bladder is no longer able to function properly so he will have a catheter for the rest of his life and a feeding tube. The doctor was adamant that he would be “like his old self” by May. Here we are two weeks out and he’s in pain like he was before the surgery. This last week his health took a big turn and he’s been unable to provide basic care for himself. He’s become reclused to the bed and cannot hold down any liquids or solids. His urine is an orange rust color and he’s lost about 6 pounds this week. His heart rate has bounced around from 110-130 with lower blood pressure. We know this all likely means he’s severely dehydrated but he refuses to go to the hospital since they will just “hook me up to an IV and send me home”. His pain levels have seemed to spike and my husband and I don’t know what to do anymore. We are both in our 20’s and lucky to be working from home during COVID-19 but will be unable to care for him once this all ends. It is beginning to take a toll on us as we don’t understand why his health took a turn. Maybe he’s just given up? Today, he complained of his lower back hurting and I’m almost certain it’s his kidneys. He’s been on oxy since last September every 4-6 hours and he’s barely able to make it through that timeframe now with his pain. Any suggestions? We called his doctor and they just put him back on an all liquid diet through his feeding tube. We took him in to radiology last week and they found no reason why he is throwing up land liquid or solid he is eating. Could it be his body is beginning to shut down? Do we look for a nursing facility or hospice for pain management? We are very young and have no idea where to go. His doctors won’t answer right now due to coronavirus and we are really very overwhelmed.",2020-04-20 02:07:06

caregiver stress,1,f8zqcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/f8zqcl/caregiver_stress/,1,1582613073.0,"Hi everyone. My aunt( 72 years old) was diagnosed 6 months ago with small cell lung cancer with metastases to the liver and lymph nodes(stage 4). Doctor gave her 6 months to live without treatment and 8 with. Now my aunt is terrified of anything that has to do with hospitals and doctors and needles and everything medicine related so she never got herself checked out. She never got married so never had children either.

She was started on chemotherapy and she did 4 rounds with good results showing that the tumors she had, had shrunk and others were so small that they weren't visible or were completely gone. Then sh\*t hit the fan: She had a cold and they put her on antibiotics but then the antibiotics did nothing so she had to take other antibiotics. Her cold went away but she had a heart attack in december, which means that she had gone 2 and a half months without treatment. Her doctor told us that she needs to get a ct scan of her head, thorax(lungs & heart), upper and lower abdomen. Turns out that during those 2 and a half months without treatment cancer had a party and some tumors grew again and now she even has a new one in her right lung. Her doctor decided no more chemo so now he started her on immunotherapy.

Last weekend(around the 17th) she developed a cough so I had a doctor come to the house because my aunt is scared sh\*tless of hospitals and since my father died of cancer in 2012 she hadn't seen the inside of a hospital until August when she had to stay in the hospital for 2 weeks. He gave her 10ml of dexamethasone and tomorrow I have to get her to the hospital for immunotherapy(once every 21 days).

My aunt even without her diagnoses is a horrible human being. Last year she wouldn't even give water to our other dying aunt. She's extremely mean and constantly insults you and she makes the type of jokes that nobody would even consider them to be a joke if they heard them. I can't stand being here any more. I gave up my life for the past 6 months to take care of her and not even a kind word or a thank you. 

My brother recently got married and became a father, my cousin lives on an island with her family so I can't expect any help from her and my other cousin also has a family and works 13 hours a day so I'm basically on my own. My cousin who lives an hour away, doesn't even call. The last time he called was for Christmas. His sister the last time she called to check in on our aunt called somewhere in late August/ early September.  My brother does visit us at least once or twice a week and brings food sometimes and calls every day.

I do everything for my aunt since I live in her house: cook, clean, bathe her, pay her bills, take her to doctor's appointments and her therapy, find doctors to come to the house to check her out. My only break from her is when I go shopping for food or coffee to bring back to the house. I can't stand this much longer. I've had more than enough and the end is nowhere in sight. I don't know if a job will be waiting for me when I go back to my city since the last time I worked was in August. I'm 35 years old and am completely isolated. I have no friends here. I also have to deal with her f\*cked in the head neighbour who thinks that I'm isolating my aunt from her because she doesn't get the fact that it's f\*cking flu season and my aunt even with the flu shot she had, has a weak immune system and a simple cold can kill her but no I'm the asshole here. My aunt also used to buy her neighbour cigarettes and give her money from time to time so since I've been staying with her and since I haven't allowed her visiting my aunt she hasn't been getting any money. I could write a book but I guess that's all for now...If you want leave me a comment here or message me so time passes by a little bit faster.",2020-02-25 06:44:33

SIL suffering seizure-like episodes; all testing is coming back clear. Has anyone else experienced this?,1,f3q7bk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/f3q7bk/sil_suffering_seizurelike_episodes_all_testing_is/,2,1581703871.0,"Sorry if this is long; I'm trying to be as comprehensive as I can.

My SIL is 52 and was diagnosed with Stage IV metastatic breast cancer in March 2019. We're coming up on a year. In that time she's responded well to chemo and did 16 rounds before switching to tamoxifen, which was some time in late June/early July 2019. She's on a plethora of other medications as well, including anti-nausea pills, painkillers, an anti-depressant/anti-anxiety, fentanyl patch, etc.

In the months leading up to her diagnosis she was increasingly light-headed and dizzy, which we (and her doctors/nurses) attributed to her low blood counts post-diagnosis.

However, since July 2019 her light-headedness and dizziness have evolved. Initially SIL would feel a dizzy spell coming on with enough time to get to a seated and safe position. Then it starting hitting very suddenly, and she was at risk of falling. Luckily she was still maintaining consciousness and always rebounded within minutes of each incident. Then she started experiencing narrowed vision and loss of hearing, trembling/jerking of her arms and legs, extreme nausea, and excruciating headaches once the episodes (as she calls them) passed. This all has been progressing and her symptoms/side effects have grown more acute over the last several months. It's only been since about December 2019/January 2020 that she actually experienced one of these ""episodes"" while we were at an appointment with her oncologist. At that time, her blood pressure came back normal for her - usually on the lower side, around 117/75. Nothing alarmingly low.

The latest: she actually suffered one of these ""episodes"" a couple days ago while by herself, passed out, and when she woke up she had vomited on herself and the couch. She has no memory of any of it and no idea of how much time had passed.

I'm not complete on the timeline, but since June of 2019, in addition to PET scans every 3 months, she has also had three brain MRIs and two spinal MRIs, none of which have showed any evidence of new growth. Everything keeps coming back clear. She has met with a neurologist and done an EEG/EKG, which also came back normal. She has an appointment next week for a 24-hour video EEG, for which she'll be admitted to the hospital so that the doctors can observe what's happening with her neurologically leading up to, during, and after one of these ""episodes."" All of her blood work each month is in the normal range, except for the tumor marker numbers, which are on the rise. However, we've seen no new evidence of growth in any of her PET scans/targeted MRIs.

Yesterday we were at her monthly check-in with her oncologist for blood work, and in the two-hour span we were there, my SIL had two milder ""episodes."" At one moment she and I were talking in the waiting room, the next she was hunched over, trembling slightly, and extremely incoherent. Luckily a nurse was nearby and assisted me with her. We were supporting her to sit upright and as the nurse was asking her questions, my SIL squinted up at her with a look of utter confusion on her face and, after several seconds of grasping for words, asked her, ""Did you say something to me?"" Afterward she had a headache, was nauseated, light-sensitive, and exhausted to the point of falling asleep. After consulting with her neurologist, her oncologist prescribed her 500mg of Keppra, an anti-seizure med, to be taking twice daily. Her first dose was early evening yesterday when I got her home and settled.

The most frustrating part is that every single test to determine what this is or what's causing it is inconclusive. I know my SIL is petrified that the cancer has spread to her spine and/or brain and it's just not showing up yet. It just confounds me that NOTHING is definitive. I've even asked her doctors if it could be the combination of powerful meds she's on, but they've told me more or less that would not be the cause.

After a half of year of unexplained pain, and after several doctor visits where they insisted nothing terrible was wrong with him, they found a growth in his abdomen during a CT. It's around where his previous cancer was (an extragonadal tumor that's considered testicular cancer, pretty rare). We don't know anything else yet, not even whether the growth is big or small, but we begin dr appointments this Monday. We will see a surgeon this Monday and an oncologist next. We have three kids, ages 9,7, and 3. I haven't had an income in almost ten years and I'm terrified. The last time my husband had cancer he nearly died from the surgery and he spent four months in intense treatment -- so he's scared. I don't know how I'm going to care for my children and my husband. I don't know how I'll do those things and also work if my husband's paid time off runs out. 

I'm terrified to tell my kids. I know I'm overthinking things, but if he should die, I don't know how I would handle everything (he is foreign and his entire family and set of old friends except for me and the kids are still in Europe). My feelings swing from one extreme to the other seemingly without my control. Half the day I won't understand what I was worried about last night, then suddenly I'll be struck with chilling fear. I spend days experiencing inexplicable nausea. I forget to eat. Is this normal? And how can I be his advocate? Is it normal to wait 2 weeks for the first oncologist appointment? Should I be insisting on faster treatment? I'm so frustrated that six months of pain went by and I didn't insist that the doctors do more. I'm ok half the time and the other half the time I'm already imagining how I'll survive without him. ",2018-07-28 04:37:36

All You Need To Know About Rehabilitation After Cancer Surgery,0,5sjvzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/5sjvzj/all_you_need_to_know_about_rehabilitation_after/,0,1486478196.0,"Rehabilitation is an integral part of the recovery process for patients post cancer surgery. The treatment during rehabilitation depends on several factors including the site of the surgery and age of the patient, among others. Additional treatment, like radiation therapy, chemotherapy and exercises may be recommended after surgery to complement the process of recovery. Medicines may be prescribed to patients for expediting the healing process and ensuring a wholesome physical and emotional healing. Oncologists like Dr. Amish Dalal assess the physical condition of patients in order to decide on the necessary rehabilitation. 
Cancer surgeries may necessitate the complete or partial removal of certain affected parts of the body and surrounding tissues that are malignant. Inflammation if any around the surgical wound is not uncommon. Rehabilitation usually offers a wide scope for expediting the healing process. Physical therapy may be advised two or three weeks after a cancer surgery.  Dr. Amish Dalal, an accomplished Surgical Oncologist, examines the patient’s condition post-surgery and recommends the next line of treatment. 
What post-surgery rehabilitation can do for patients
Post surgery rehabilitation aims to treat common symptoms experienced after surgery. The nature of rehabilitation that a patient may require depends on the post-surgical care needed, the type of surgery that was conducted, and the site of the surgery. 
Rehabilitation often proves to be beneficial for relieving patients in the following ways:
•	Reduction in pain arising from the site of surgery
•	Reduction in inflammation around the operated area
•	Increase in the range of motion
•	Boost in physical strength
•	Restoration of regular lifestyle and activities 
Amish Dalal reviews the condition of patients post-surgery and decides upon the necessity of rehabilitation and the course that needs to be undertaken. 
Symptoms that may indicate the necessity for rehabilitation 
Cancer surgery, like any other surgery, requires time to heal completely to enable patients to return to their usual way of life. However, there may be symptoms that impede the healing process. These could be:
•	Fatigue and weakness
•	Sleep deprivation 
•	Depression and anxiety 
•	Pain at the site of surgery
•	Difficulty in undertaking daily activities
•	Inflexibility of muscles
•	Difficulty in concentrating or memorising 
Doctors observe patients after a surgery, both before and after their discharge from the hospital. This helps them know how well the patient is recovering, and in administering the necessary post-surgical care. Doctor Amish Dalal recommends his patients to regularly monitor their health and discuss their progress and concerns with him post surgery.
Here are some professionals that help with post-cancer surgery rehabilitation
A team of experts work in coordination with an oncologist in administering the necessary post-surgery rehabilitation while patients are at the hospital. After discharge, the oncologist may recommend patients to other specialists to aid the process of recovery. 
A team of rehabilitation experts usually includes the following:
Rehabilitation Specialist: Assists patients in achieving the desired range of movement of limbs, and regaining their strength. 
Physiotherapist: Helps patients regain mobility. This is essential for patients who have undergone a cancer surgery that has affected their movement. Those with difficulty in balancing, suffering from loss of muscles due to prolonged bed rest, and patients walking with an assistive device get to benefit from physiotherapy. Patients can also be administered radiation 
Dietician: Patients need to follow a strict diet especially after a surgery, to restore their health. With a thorough knowledge of the daily nutritional needs of patients, dieticians regulate their food intake to monitor the body weight so as to aid in recovery. While there are dieticians to ensure the correct nutritional value at hospitals, patients may consult a professional dietician for advice on the necessary diet chart after their release from the hospital. Amish Dalal recommends patients to follow the prescribed diet during the rehabilitation period.  
Psychologist/Counsellor: During the prolonged course of the illness, some patients may require counselling support. Psychologists counsel patients for their mental and emotional well-being. Amish Dalal, an expert Oncologist, may recommend counselling if needed.
