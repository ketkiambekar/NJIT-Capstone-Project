0,I’m not ready.,615,9isza1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/9isza1/im_not_ready/,82,1537917201.0,"In 2016 I was diagnosed with stage 4 of a severely aggressive bone cancer after months of severe pain in my sacrum and left leg. I was diagnosed the month before I turned 16. 

Ewing’s Sarcoma. Rare, and even rarer to have it where I did. One big angry tumour in my sacrum, wrapping around all the nerves in my leg. 
I named her Shannon. 

So because it was an aggressive cancer, we needed to hit it with an even more aggressive chemo protocol. The protocol I was under would have killed an adult, but because I was/am a kid, it only severely harmed me. I was bedridden for the full year and a bit of treatment. 

I did 36 radiation fractions, and 11 rounds of chemo in my induction phase, and then a round every three weeks for a year. It was supposed to be every 2 weeks, but because it was hurting my body and threatening my blood counts so much, we had to add an extra week of recovery time. 

It was the most horrible year of my life. All my friends were out partying and dating and having fun, and I was so sick I couldn’t even go to school. I was barely conscious at all. A few of my friends were amazing during it all and stuck by me, doing everything and anything to help the stress on me and my family. They were bloody amazing, and i’m never going to be able to repay them for making my year that bit easier. 

Halfway through treatment, I was admitted to the ICU after a few scary low blood pressure readings. I basically lived in hospital all year so it wasn’t much of a bother. I couldn’t really grasp how sick I was for those 8 days in the ICU until I overheard nurses talking about how if I hadn’t have made it down there that night, I would have died. 

So a few major emergency surgeries later and another few months of treatment, I made it. 

I did it. I got my N.E.D (No Evidence of Disease, because there’s never a certain “you’re cancer free” with Ewings) January this year. I’d won. 
During my recovery, I went to physio and learnt how to walk again and got stronger. I even made it to school for a few days. 

And then the pain started. This time in my ribs on my right side. We treated the pain for a while, and then it was time for my 6 month check up scans. 
I lit up EVERYWHERE. 

I had a massive tumour in my spine, wrapping around my spinal cord and causing the pain in my ribs. 
There were tumours in my ankles and legs and shoulders and lungs. 
It was official. I’m terminal. 

There’s no way to stop it, and I’m currently on more treatment to at least slow it down and buy me some time. 

I’m dying. I’m 17 - 18 in a few months. I’m not ready to die. I can’t. I can’t leave my family and friends behind. 

My mum is my entire world. I love her more than anything and owe her everything I have and ever will have. She’s everything I could ever hope to be and I’m leaving her. She has to lose her daughter. I can’t do that to her. 

I’ve got an older sister - my best friend in the world. I can’t leave her either. We promised we’d grow old together. We promised we’d spoil each other’s kids. 

And then there’s my 12 year old brother - my baby. I’m supposed to look after him, to protect him. And I won’t be able to do that. He’s 12 for Christ’s sake he can’t lose his sister. I can’t do that to him - he should be worrying about not having enough v-bucks on fortnite for the new skin, not about how he’s going to deal with everything when his older sister fucking dies. 

And my half siblings, a 6 year old sister and a 2 year old brother. I love them more than anything in the entire world. My sister is my best friend and I’m hers. She looks up to me and I can’t leave her. I was supposed to watch them grow up and help her sneak out when she was older. I was supposed to be there to help them with homework and relationship trouble. 
And now I can’t. 

I’ll never see any of my younger siblings graduate or get their first girlfriends or boyfriends. I’ll never see them get married. I’ll never meet their kids. 

And the worst part is that they’re all so young that they’re gonna forget me. 
For the 12 year old, he’ll remember me, but over the years it’s gonna get harder and harder to remember the times we’ve fought or played or bickered. He won’t remember my mannerisms or the times we’d spend hanging out in my room. 
And the babies won’t remember anything about me. That’s what’s breaking my heart. 
All the games and the stories and the lullabies and the secrets - gone. They won’t remember anything. I’ll just be the older sister they never knew that passed away when she was a teenager. 

I can’t leave my family behind. I just can’t do it. I’m not ready. 

And my best friend. The friend that I was planning to move out after school with. The friend that has stuck by me the most. The friend that was ready to carry my children because I couldn’t anymore (thanks to the radiation). The friend that I was going to grow old with and bicker with endlessly. 
I’m not going to have her anymore. And again, I’ll just be the friend she had when she was young that passed away. 

I can’t do this. I don’t want to do this. But I don’t have a choice. 

My doctor said he’d be surprised if I made it to the end of the year. That’s 2 months. 
2 months to say my goodbyes and to make as many memories as I can with as many of my loved ones as I can. 
I’m not ready. Please god please I just don’t want to die. 

I just needed to vent to someone, anyone. I’m sorry. It’s 1am and everyone’s asleep, and I didn’t want to burden my mum by letting her know I’m feeling like this right now. She worries too much as it is. 


***UPDATE*** 
So I’m still here, as you can tell. I’ve been fighting like hell, and it definitely hasn’t been easy - but I’m okay. 
I’m doing well actually (head wise, at least). Pain is under control, nausea is under control and all that Jazz. 
I’ve stopped chemo, because towards the end it had just stopped working altogether. So for now we just zap any problematic tumours with radiation if they start causing too much pain / too many problems. 

I’ve recently had a fall, and really smacked my right foot. So it’s been out of action for about a week now, but i’m slowly recovering. 
I’ve also been on oxygen for a couple months now because my lungs just aren’t doing the job completely. Nothing too bad; as in I could technically go without the oxygen’s help - it just wouldn’t be too fun. 

Otherwise... I’ve really been okay. (Just don’t ask about my dad. Ugh. Lmao)
We all know my time’s coming, but if the time since I’ve made this post has meant anything - it means I can fight a little longer, as long as I’ve got my family and friends behind me. 

I appreciate all of you guys that have stuck by me and sent in your continuous support. It was always crazy sweet reading your messages and always really uplifting. So thank you. 

Here’s to this not being my last update, either!

In August we did 10 days of radiation. Then Monday, August 19, we took him to see the surgeon about having a port placed for chemo. We knew the cancer had spread to many areas, but the oncologist thought that chemo would help extend his life. He couldn't stand up long enough to get from the car to the wheelchair. We had to get staff from the surgeon's office to help us get him into the wheelchair and into the doctor's office. The surgeon looked at him and sent us to the ER.

The ER staff moved us from a regular room to the trauma room. They found fluid around his heart. A few minutes after they went in to drain it, people started running into and out of the room. Literally running, not just walking fast. They got him somewhat stabilized and told us that we needed to get him to a hospital in the city (about 90 min by car). It was a rotten way to get a helicopter ride, and I am sure he didn't even get to enjoy it. The hospital had to intubate him to give him pain meds. He had been moaning and whining when they tried to drain the fluid from his heart. We heard it from outside the rood. So having him sent by air ambulance to the city was NOT good news. If it had just been his heart, his cardiologist could have handled it at the hospital at home. But his kidneys were not working, and we don't have a kidney doc at out hospital.

By the time I got to the hospital, he was in the ICU. The nurses and doctors were AMAZING. So caring, and not just about him. I finally managed to get away to find a hotel at about midnight. The next few days were a whirl of hospital, hotel, my mom and kids coming up to visit and/or stay, and my inlaws and his sister coming to visit. It was awful but also good.

On Wednesday we decided to let him go on Thursday afternoon. He and I had our 28th anniversary on the 10th, and on the 22nd I had to say goodbye. It just is so awful and painful.

After they took the tubes out, our sons read him to sleep. He spent many years reading stories to them, complete with all the voices. So our boys got a copy of one of my husband's favorite book series for kids (Hank the Cowdog) and they read until the end. It was the sweetest thing I have ever seen them do. One of the most loving things they could have done.",2019-08-24 11:00:29

11,I went to the ER for me but ended up staying and sitting with my chemo buddy till he passed...,406,a9wgqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/a9wgqi/i_went_to_the_er_for_me_but_ended_up_staying_and/,29,1545918551.0,"I was in a lot of pain and ended up going to the ER. While I was there, I saw “Charleston Chew”. He was my chemo buddy, as we were close in age and had pretty similar schedules. 
In his very crude and sarcastic way, he softly yelled “Hello my delicious Korean BBQ”, his nickname for me. I smiled, as he tried to chuck an ice chip at me. I could tell something was wrong because he looked and sounded weaker than usual. I asked the nurse why he was there and she couldn’t disclose anything but said in short, things weren’t looking good. After I got looked at and discharged, I went over to him.
I asked him what was up and he told me that he went to spend Christmas with his family and he wasn’t feeling well but wanted to give them that. He flew back and straight to the ER. He looked at me and asked if I’d stay with him but to go if I had plans cause “a girl who looks as hot as you with cancer, should have plans and be getting laid”. Our humor is (was) similar. I stayed and I told him about my holidays and he struggled to tell me about his... I think I knew what was happening because it took everything in me to not start breaking down and cry in front of him.

He told me about the first time we met. I had already been a regular and he was a fish out of water. He had Stage 4 lung cancer and was given 6-12 months to live. He didn’t understand why he was doing chemo, as he felt his quality of life was going to be shittier. But he saw a “delicious Korean BBQ” girl with a sassy attitude who he could make friends with and it made going back, a little easier every day. I didn’t know that... 
We are (were) both in our 30’s and talked about our life being on hold, while everyone else was busy getting married, popping babies, buying houses — as we impeded doom, death, and debt. Haha. 
The reason I called him Charleston Chew at the beginning was because he had an affinity for that damn candy. When he couldn’t eat anything else, you could count on him sucking on those damn things at any hour. I’m pretty sure that was his only nutrition for the past 8 months. One time he smiled and it was just melted chocolate and nougat, I nearly peed myself from laughter. 
When things got hard, we leaned on each other. When we got fed up with this whole process, we understood it. We could confide in one another. When we got stupid depressed and suicidal, we could go to one another without judgement. We also binge watched all of The Wire, Gilmore Girls, and Marvelous Mrs Maisel together. (Gilmore Girls was his pick) We became real friends. 
His support system was flying in from out of town and there would be times when he was alone, so I’d FaceTime him. He would try and convince me he had friends but I knew he had a hard time asking for help—- as I knew that feeling all too well. He’d joke that if he wasn’t dying, that some would consider what we were doing as “dating”. Haha. 

The doctors were able to find him a bed upstairs to make him more comfortable. He asked me if it was selfish to not give his family the “last moments” as he could have stayed home with them and I honestly didn’t know what to say. They were called and on their way. And everyone knew there was a good chance he’d be gone by the time they arrived. He told me he didn’t want to be by himself and for the first time, I think I really saw him. He asked me to stay and to not let him die alone. He said he was scared and that’s when I lost it. I apologized for crying and he said his dying wish was for a blowjob. Hahaha. He really knew how to use humor till the end. But even through his crude humor, I knew he was being honest in asking me to stay. 
So I did. I held his hand and told him about all the plans I had for 2019, after I get the all-okay from my doctors. All the traveling I want to do, the places I want to see, the food I want to eat, and air I want to feel. And he said “You deserve it. Where ever you go, take me with you.” 
At some point he kind of stopped responding. The machines didn’t make a huge fuss but the nurses came over and I knew. Luckily the staff didn’t kick me out because I wasn’t family, they allowed me to sit with him till his family got there. I didn’t know I’d be so emotional... this person, someone that was a stranger less than a year ago, had become a dear friend because we connected over this sick disease and I just watched him die. His death wasn’t about me but I couldn’t help but think “cancer you bitch, you could take me too....” and I was both heartbroken and grateful for his death and my life. 

As his family arrived, I gave them their space. His mom knew who I was and just gave me a big hug. She said “All he did was talk about how his new friend, he made his last few months, were some of the greatest months. And more importantly, thank you not letting him go alone. For staying by his side. Thank you for giving that gift to my son.” I had no idea I had any impact on one’s life like that... his whole family kept thanking me for staying with him till the end. 

I literally went to the ER because I was in pain but call it fate, destiny, kismet, the stars aligning or whatever... but I was meant to be there for more and something bigger than myself. To show up for my friend Charleston Chew. 

May you RIP dear friend. Maybe in another timeline I’m giving you that blowjob you dearly wanted. Haha. 
Thanks for everything. Rest easy.",2018-12-27 13:49:11

13,"A small personal guide on how I deal with terminal cancer, if it can help anyone at all even a bit",381,aaabgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/aaabgx/a_small_personal_guide_on_how_i_deal_with/,54,1546032611.0,"I'm 30 and going to die soon. I've had a year to come to terms with it. Here is how I rationalize it if it can be of help to anyone.

I was lucky to have so much time to think this over, time really does help to accept the inevitable. We all know it's coming someday. It just comes sooner for some. People say I'm pretty zen considering the circumstances and I'd say it is an accurate assessment. I certainly wouldn't be this zen if I had just learned I had cancer AND a few weeks to live at the same time. I knew every step of the way my chances were very slim and my oncologists were very honest about it.

I'm not saying it's a walk in the park either, I have serious pain issues, I'm heavily medicated and I try to beat into submission that stupid feeling of guilt for making people who love me feel sad. No, it's not your fault you have cancer, but you feel like the bearer of bad news all the time and that can take its toll. I usually just tell my SO my brain is trying to make me feel guilty today and she makes it go away with a kind word and a hug. Which brings me to making a small list of what helps me deal with the situation. This is the internet after all and we like lists!

* **I surround myself with people who make me feel good.** Not all of your friends and loved ones will react well to your situation and that's ok, we all have our strength and weaknesses. Identify those who make you feel good when you hang out with them instead of those who will leech your energy without even meaning to. Let them deal with their emotions, they got plenty more time and energy to spend than you.

* **I feel blessed every day that I have the time to say goodbye instead of leaving everyone suddenly by surprise.** I'm a young adult, statistically, I should die of a suicide or a sudden car crash, not of cancer. I feel so blessed that I have the time to plan my funeral, to write letters to loved ones, to say the things that matter and offer loved ones that opportunity as well. I think this is much preferable to the alternative, but I've met others with terminal cancer who say they would have prefered to die instantly by surprise so maybe I'm the exception.

* **I've already been dead for a few billion years, and it wasn't too bad.** As you can guess from this I don't believe in an afterlife at all. For me dying is a return to the state I was in before my birth. The year 1900 isn't very scary to me even if I did not exist. The year 2020 isn't very scary to me for the same reasons. Non-existence is my standard state except for that small blimp of life I will have been blessed to experience over the universe's lifespan. Maybe this is a scary concept to some but it brings me comfort.

* **I accept I have absolutely no control over the progress of my illness.** I know some people have a need for the illusion of control, but the truth is that apart from eating well, sleeping sufficiently, doing you chemo/treatment, getting a bit of exercise even if it's just walking and making the effort to have a social life, all of these when possible, then you're already doing everything you can. Give yourself a pat on the back and try to accept that things will happen whether you like it or not, so try to enjoy the ride even if you're not the one driving.

* **I have little time, it is precious, but I must accept my energy is limited and I have the right to rest without feeling guilty.** I can't let the feeling that I'm somehow wasting time if I Netflix and chill take over. I have little time, yes, but I have a right to use some of that time to relax without feeling guilty. My body and mind need rest and I need a sense of normality.

* **I give myself small goals and projects.** If I just wait passively for death, then I feel like it's wasted time. Even if I probably just have a few weeks at most, then I'll find a small project to accomplish during that time that I can realistically accomplish and be proud of. In my case, it's writing one goodbye letter to every person I love and making a video montage for my funeral. For me, productive time is a happy time, especially knowing it will bring joy to loved ones.

* **I've lived making sure I'd regret nothing and I'm surrounded by loved ones.** Now, this part is the one that helps me the most but It can be too late for the first part and you may have no control over the loved ones part. I'm lucky that my grandfather told me on his deathbed when I was 16 that when I'd be dying I wouldn't regret my mistakes but instead the things I never tried but would have wanted to accomplish. I took that advice to heart and applied it every day of my life. Maybe it's too late for you to apply that advice, but it makes my incoming death a hell of a lot easier knowing I have no regrets and wouldn't change a thing in my life apart from cancer. I also understand you don't control if you have a good family and you may not have had the chance to develop good friendships, and I'm sorry if that's the case. There are support groups out there that may help you but I imagine it must be a poor substitute. Having no regrets and being surrounded by loved ones is simply what helps me the most through this.


There, I think that covers it. I wish you all the best and if a single element in this list has helped someone out there then I consider this post was worth it. Good luck everyone!",2018-12-28 21:30:11

I'm sitting by my wife right now and she is in and out of consciousness, with her awake times being full of confusion. She has stage 4 Cervical cancer, which started in her cervix last year, but was too large when we caught it to do surgery. After a successful radiation therapy treatment she was declared cured in November 2019.

May 2020 we found it had metastasized to her liver, and after 4 months of chemo that didn't work, and one round of immunotherapy that failed, we are now here. There are no eligible clinical trials, no other treatments. Her life, hopes and dreams, everything we said we'd do but never did, it's all over.

I can't say goodbye. Two weeks ago we were going for a night drive and complaining about the world, politics, breakfast burritos with fish. She was in pain but full of smiles and life. Now she isn't able to comprehend fully what is happening. She can't tell me it's OK. She can respond sometimes but she doesn't really connect to anything happening.

I am just as shocked and upset as everyone else is, given how young he was and the fact that no one knew he was sick. An untimely death from cancer is a very real and present fear for many of us who post here. My heart goes out to his family and loved ones.

I do want to remind the readers and newcomers here that this sub is a support sub for cancer patients, caregivers, and family. We are not able to diagnose anyone.

Here are a couple of resources you can look at if you are concerned about colon cancer, any cancer, or want to know more. These resources are way more extensive and accurate than what the posters here can offer. Thanks for reading.

I used to read the sub everyday and write frequently. Now I just can't seem to have any words left in me.

My wife (/u/eternalthesiswriter) passed away on August 15th. She didn't use reddit much, but when she was diagnosed I told her about this place and she came here for advice. Everyone was very kind and gave us great tips that helped us through the beginning of her journey with cancer. Later on, I became an active member of the sub. Being here and sharing the experience with all of you helped me, helped us, so much. You showed me the power of community. I asked for help; I vented and freely expressed my frustrations and fears; I shared the good, the bad, and the ugly. I was never judged, my pain was never undermined, I received the support I was looking for and so desperately needed. I am so thankful to all of you.

My wife's last months were very difficult. She was in and out of the hospital since February until she died, she developed chronic pain and then opioid dependency, she was very depressed and exhausted. I watched her slip away day by day and I don't think I'll ever completely heal from that. We suffered so much through it. However, her last few days were beautiful. She had the chance to decide to stop all treatments that were not intended to give her comfort. She was able to decide when and where to die. I don't how I did it, but I hosted a horde of people at the hospital, sat with them in the waiting room and explained what was happening, gave them gentle instructions so she would still be comfortable around people while being so vulnerable, comforted them outside her room after they said goodbye to her, kept the spirits up by reminding everyone she lived a full life, was truly and fully loved, and was dying surrounded by me, her friends, and her family. I did it for her. I did it because I knew she needed to see all the people she had loved throughout her life. But it was hard and we didn't have much time together. I don't regret it, but still it hurts. She was at peace and happy at the end. She left with a smile on her face and that was a great gift. I knew then and there I had done a good job despite the circumstances. 

Yes, she died, but we had such a great time together and she was so loved. Not only when she was healthy, but also when she was living with cancer and then dying of cancer. I gave up my whole life to be her partner, her caretaker, and her unconditional 24/7 support through the disease, and I'm so, so, so glad I did it. I quit my job, I spent my savings, I lost many of my friends. There has been nothing else and there will be nothing else more important than those nineteenth months we spent together. I appreciate and cherish every second of the journey, even the horrible, traumatizing, painful parts of it because I had the honor to be with her and love through it.

She's gone and I'm slowly trying to rebuild my life. Doing this without her hurts all the time. I miss her so much. I have a lot of support: my friends and her friends have showered me with compassion, patience, understanding, practical help, and possibly too much food. Yet, I don't know how I'll make it without her, but I'm trying. I promised her I would be ok, so I'm trying. I hope she knows I'm trying. I hope wherever she is she has forgiven me for my mistakes and shortcomings. I hope wherever she is she knows I love her, I will always love her, I have always loved her. 

Thank you everybody for being there for us. I will be forever grateful to all of you. I admire you and respect you all so much. We are stronger than anyone else can imagine. Thank you for making the decision to live and love everyday in face of this disease. In the end, whatever happens, whether you or your loved one gets cured or dies, that's what really matters: the love you give yourself and the love you give others.",2019-08-25 22:16:16

What it's like to go thru cancer and treatment 
 

What’s it like to go through cancer treatment? 
It’s something like this: One day, you’re minding your own business, you open the fridge to get some breakfast, and OH MY GOD THERE’S A MOUNTAIN LION IN YOUR FRIDGE.
Wait, what? How? Why is there a mountain lion in your fridge? NO TIME TO EXPLAIN. RUN! THE MOUNTAIN LION WILL KILL YOU! UNLESS YOU FIND SOMETHING EVEN MORE FEROCIOUS TO KILL IT FIRST!

So you take off running, and the mountain lion is right behind you. You know the only thing that can kill a mountain lion is a bear, and the only bear is on top of the mountain, so you better find that bear. You start running up the mountain in hopes of finding the bear. Your friends desperately want to help, but they are powerless against mountain lions, as mountain lions are godless killing machines. But they really want to help, so they’re cheering you on and bringing you paper cups of water and orange slices as you run up the mountain and yelling at the mountain lion - “GET LOST, MOUNTAIN LION, NO ONE LIKES YOU” - and you really appreciate the support, but the mountain lion is still coming.

Also, for some reason, there’s someone in the crowd who’s yelling “that’s not really a mountain lion, it’s a puma” and another person yelling “I read that mountain lions are allergic to kale, have you tried rubbing kale on it?”

As you’re running up the mountain, you see other people fleeing their own mountain lions. Some of the mountain lions seem comparatively wimpy - they’re half grown and only have three legs or whatever, and you think to yourself - why couldn’t I have gotten one of those mountain lions? But then you look over at the people who are fleeing mountain lions the size of a monster truck with huge prehistoric saber fangs, and you feel like an asshole for even thinking that - and besides, who in their right mind would want to fight a mountain lion, even a three-legged one?

Finally, the person closest to you, whose job it is to take care of you - maybe a parent or sibling or best friend or, in my case, my husband - comes barging out of the woods and jumps on the mountain lion, whaling on it and screaming “GODDAMMIT MOUNTAIN LION, STOP TRYING TO EAT MY WIFE,” and the mountain lion punches your husband right in the face. Now your husband (or whoever) is rolling around on the ground clutching his nose, and he’s bought you some time, but you still need to get to the top of the mountain.

Eventually you reach the top, finally, and the bear is there. Waiting. For both of you. You rush right up to the bear, and the bear rushes the mountain lion, but the bear has to go through you to get to the mountain lion, and in doing so, the bear TOTALLY KICKS YOUR ASS, but not before it *also* punches your husband in the face. And your husband is now staggering around with a black eye and bloody nose, and saying, “Can I get some help, I’ve been punched in the face by two apex predators and I think my nose is broken,” and all you can say is “I’M KIND OF BUSY IN CASE YOU HADN’T NOTICED I’M FIGHTING A MOUNTAIN LION.”

Then, IF YOU ARE LUCKY, the bear leaps on the mountain lion and they are locked in epic battle until finally the two of them roll off a cliff edge together, and the mountain lion is dead. 
Maybe. You’re not sure - it fell off the cliff, but mountain lions are crafty. It could come back at any moment.

And all your friends come running up to you and say, “That was amazing! You’re so brave, we’re so proud of you! You didn’t die! That must be a huge relief!” 

Meanwhile, you blew out both your knees, you’re having an asthma attack, you twisted your ankle, and also you have been mauled by a bear. And everyone says “Boy, you must be excited to walk down the mountain!” And all you can think as you stagger to your feet is “Fuck this mountain, I never wanted to climb it in the first place.😳”

Initially her surgeons were only planning to sample enough abnormal tissue to get a diagnosis. When they got in there, i guess the tumour was more easily distinguishable than they thought, so they were able to remove everything that looked abnormal in her brain. Her post-op MRI didn’t show any remaining tumour either which is fantastic. We aren’t out of the woods by any means but this is the best possible outcome we could have had so far. 

Our next big hurdle is the pathology results. If it comes back as a high grade tumour like ATRT (which is likely) we will need to begin chemo as soon as possible to kill any remaining cells. 

Aside from all that she is doing amazing. she woke up within an hour from surgery and was talking to us, and she may be able to leave PICU and go to the regular ward today! It’s only been 24 hours so I’m surprised. She hasn’t complained not once, and she’s only on a very small dose of morphine. 

She blows me away with her strength and resilience. I never expected that my 4 year old would be able to breeze through brain surgery like it was no biggie. She is such a little fighter. 
Thank you everyone for your support on my last post. It’s great to have this community to check in with.

33,The best news of my life: Mom’s stage IV lung cancer has gone into complete remission.,253,f6ira6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/f6ira6/the_best_news_of_my_life_moms_stage_iv_lung/,76,1582180617.0,"Hey guys, 

I promised to keep you updated, so I really want to share that moment with you. About 5 weeks ago my mom had her first control PET scan after four cycles of chemotherapy and Keytruda, two Keytruda-only infusions, a metastectomy of the spine and IMRT of the spine. Her PET scan showed that all her metastatic sites had disappeared, all her lymph nodes had cleared up and her tumor had shrunk from 88x64 to 19x11mm. 

Her doctors decided to ablate the original tumor with SBRT so we returned to the hospital this Monday. The radiation oncologist did a CT scan and then some respiratory simulation. 

Today...my phone starts ringing in the morning, I see an unknown number. I pick up: “Hello, this is Dr.X, your mother’s radiation oncologist.” 

At this point my heart skips probably half a minute worth of regular beats. Her doctors have never called us before, so I fear bad news (more extensive disease than anticipated so no SBRT).

Next, Dr.X continues: “I cannot do SBRT because your mom’s cancer has disappeared entirely. My colleagues and I have been looking at the PET-CT scan and yesterday’s CT images and we literally cannot see a single dot of what was there 5 weeks ago. Congratulations, your mom has responded completely to Keytruda monotherapy and her cancer has fled her lung faster than we could manage to ablate it.” I probably say: “Are you sure?”, “Thank you”, “Amazing” and “How’s that possible” more times than I can count.

I am not even sure what’s going on right now. It seems absolutely surreal that in 4-5 short months my mom has gone from 6 painkillers a day, facing one of the deadliest cancers, to...my old mom, pain-free, happy, full of life, eager to return to work, take care of our home and her favorite dog, and travel.

Her doctors seem equally...pleasantly surprised. As I have mentioned before, mom’s PDL1 negative, so the odds of her responding to Keytruda were quite slim to begin with. A complete response...I was afraid to even dream of that.

She will stay on Keytruda for another 18 months. 

Thank you guys so much for the incredible support all throughout that uphill battle. I will stick around r/cancer for as long as I can help anyone out. ❤️",2020-02-20 06:36:57

She got onto the couch, felt short of breath, and asked my dad to rub her back to calm her down.

She then closed her eyes, leaned against him to rest, and passed. She died in the comfort of her own home, not hooked up to machines in hospice. She was beside the man who was the love of her life, her caretaker, and just went to sleep. She didn't suffer.

She doesn't have to suffer.

She lost mobility in her legs so she couldn't even use the bathroom alone. She absolutely hated it, having to wear adult diapers and not having any independence.

My mom is finally free from this disgusting, awful disease. I miss her so fucking much, of course. She was my best friend, after all.

But.. she's finally free from the medication and the needles and the captivity that NSCLC held her in.

She has her beautiful, long, brown hair back. She can sing with a full voice, her throat not aching. She can walk again.

You start running up the mountain in hopes of finding the bear. Your friends desperately want to help, but they are powerless against mountain lions, as mountain lions are godless killing machines. But they really want to help, so they’re cheering you on and bringing you paper cups of water and orange slices as you run up the mountain and yelling at the mountain lion - “GET LOST, MOUNTAIN LION, NO ONE LIKES YOU” - and you really appreciate the support, but the mountain lion is still coming.

Also, for some reason, there’s someone in the crowd who’s yelling “that’s not really a mountain lion, it’s a puma” and another person yelling “I read that mountain lions are allergic to kale, have you tried rubbing kale on it?”

As you’re running up the mountain, you see other people fleeing their own mountain lions. Some of the mountain lions seem comparatively wimpy - they’re half grown and only have three legs or whatever, and you think to yourself - why couldn’t I have gotten one of those mountain lions? But then you look over at the people who are fleeing mountain lions the size of a monster truck with huge prehistoric saber fangs, and you feel like an asshole for even thinking that - and besides, who in their right mind would want to fight a mountain lion, even a three-legged one?

Finally, the person closest to you, whose job it is to take care of you - maybe a parent or sibling or best friend or, in my case, my husband - comes barging out of the woods and jumps on the mountain lion, whaling on it and screaming “GODDAMMIT MOUNTAIN LION, STOP TRYING TO EAT MY WIFE,” and the mountain lion punches your husband right in the face. Now your husband (or whatever) is rolling around on the ground clutching his nose, and he’s bought you some time, but you still need to get to the top of the mountain.

Eventually you reach the top, finally, and the bear is there. Waiting. For both of you. You rush right up to the bear, and the bear rushes the mountain lion, but the bear has to go through you to get to the mountain lion, and in doing so, the bear TOTALLY KICKS YOUR ASS, but not before it also punches your husband in the face. And your husband is now staggering around with a black eye and bloody nose, and saying “can I get some help, I’ve been punched in the face by two apex predators and I think my nose is broken,” and all you can say is “I’M KIND OF BUSY IN CASE YOU HADN’T NOTICED I’M FIGHTING A MOUNTAIN LION.”

Then, IF YOU ARE LUCKY, the bear leaps on the mountain lion and they are locked in epic battle until finally the two of them roll off a cliff edge together, and the mountain lion is dead.

Maybe. You’re not sure - it fell off the cliff, but mountain lions are crafty. It could come back at any moment.

And all your friends come running up to you and say “that was amazing! You’re so brave, we’re so proud of you! You didn’t die! That must be a huge relief!”
Meanwhile, you blew out both your knees, you’re having an asthma attack, you twisted your ankle, and also you have been mauled by a bear. And everyone says “boy, you must be excited to walk down the mountain!” And all you can think as you stagger to your feet is “fuck this mountain, I never wanted to climb it in the first place.”

43,I’m been told my cancer isn’t curable and I’m lost,229,fqtfrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/fqtfrf/im_been_told_my_cancer_isnt_curable_and_im_lost/,52,1585461154.0,"So... this week I was told that my cancer isn’t curable. I was diagnosed in September 2019 with liver metastasis while roughly 7 months pregnant. I was told it don’t look good, but there was hope.

After a lot of meetings they decided to do a C-section, so my beautiful little girl arrived about 7 weeks too early. Healthy and strong. I was put on chemo until December when they decided it had shrunk enough and in January I underwent a massive surgery, removing about 70% of my liver. 

Sadly that didn’t seem to be enough. Markers in my blood were back this month, and after a PET scan they now know that it’s spread to my bones... spine and hips at least, and I don’t have a lot of time left. My oncologist estimated 1-2 years. I got the news this week. And I feel so horribly lost. I look at my little girl, now almost 6 months old and I... hurt, I ache, I want to be there for her... I want to see her grow up and turn into the beautiful strong woman I know she’ll be. I feel so cheated, I was starting the best part of my life and now I’ve been told that it’s ending...

Now I’m in no way giving up, I’m back on chemo and I’m going to fight this with everything I have, I’m going to look for every clinical trial and experimental treatment, but sometimes I honestly don’t know what to do with myself. I’m 31 and all I want with every fibre of my being is to be there for my girl and partner.

So if anyone has any tips, advice, treatments to recommend... anything. I just want to feel a little less lost.

Edit: So lost I can’t even type anymore it seems, that’s what you get for crying and typing. Thanks for all the love and motivation so far though. ❤️",2020-03-29 05:52:34

Then theres the other end of the spectrum. ""Oh yeah, my cousins best friend died of breast cancer when she was 32. It was so sad."" FUCKING THANKS. THATS EXACTLY WHAT I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

I see so many posts from caretakers asking how they can better support their partners, or grateful posts from people thanking their spouses, kids, partners, SOs, etc. 

I see posts talking about how hard Covid has been because their partners can't come with them to appointments or treatments, can't be with them in surgery. But that's been the reality for single people long before Covid. We were already doing that. It's hard but it's possible.

I went through cancer while single (I'm still navigating it months after active treatment). Its been hard. I relied on my parents (who live in another city) and friends (but it's not the same when you're living alone). Recovering from surgery in an empty apartment, not having someone to hug you when the side effects are too much, no one to calm you down the first day you wake up with hair all over your pillow, no one to help take care of surgical wounds, no one to rub your back when your throwing up at 2am. 

It's. So. Hard. 

But you know what? I see fewer complaints from the people doing it on their own than I do from people with partners. You know that you have to do this because you don't have someone to pick up the slack. 

I'm a few months out of treatment now. I went through 4 surgeries and chemotherapy on my own. I went to appointments alone, took notes so I wouldn't forget things, tracked my meds, recovered alone. I know so many of you out there are doing the same, and doing it with very few complaints, because you are your own support system.

If anyone is currently going through treatment on their own and they need someone to talk to, don't be afraid to reach out. You've got this. **You're so strong.**",2020-08-18 00:33:55

I was put on targeted pills for my specific mutation (ALK) and also had whole brain radiation, lung surgery, gamma knife surgery, and chest radiation. Now I have NED and will be on the pills until they stop working. 

At the start of this, I was so desperate to find success stories.

I was pulled off an oral chemo two months ago due to blood clots. Now the oncologist is hesitant to put me on another chemo because my blood counts are low and my body weight continues to be low. I have tried over several months to put on weight but it is just not working. High protein and calorie drinks, icecreams, pbj sandwiches, mashed potatoes - name it, I have tried them.

Add to that, my daily terrible stomach pains, nausea, bloating and all other issues makes it extremely difficult for me to eat or drink like a normal person. I guess its just the nature of the disease or cachexia.

So after having gone through the standard cancer treatments - chemo, radiation, surgery, chemo...my options are at a dead end. The oncologist said that without treatment I could last perhaps a few weeks, months to a year - he cannot really say. And even if I were to get chemo, it won't help me much, maybe add a little more time to the inevitable.

So, I guess thats it. I lost my wife to another non-related cancer a few years ago. She was 38. And now I am facing death before reaching 50. My son who is majoring in Biology because he wants to be a doctor (A determined decision made by him after his mom's death) will unfortunately become an orphan.

I wouldn’t be able to go to school to attend my senior year and and was heartbroken to be isolated from my friends. 

Over the course of about 5 months of intensive chemotherapy my hair fell out and I felt worse. After 3 rounds of chemo I was forced to undergo another biopsy as the doctors feared I was not responding to treatment. During this biopsy I found out that there was a high possibility of me losing one or both of my testicles. Luckily I didn’t have to increase the intensity of my treatment and I was able to finish out the rest of my chemo by March this year. 

My goal throughout treatment was to be in remission and able to spend my 18th birthday with friends without worrying about any side effects and symptoms of treatment. Unfortunately that didn’t work out but I will still celebrate after COVID quarantine is over. A few days ago I was told I was in remission and did not need any more chemo. This has been the most exciting part of my year so far. Unfortunately with COVID I won’t be able to go back to school for a few months like I wanted and my graduation has been cancelled. 

I’m truly thankful for my support system who helped me feel loved while I fought cancer. In particular one of my friends who would come over after school whenever I needed company and who helped me partake in new hobbies such as gardening, building computers and remodeling my room. I also relied on the support of one of my teachers who made sure to check on me often by texting my mother and I. He too is a cancer survivor and worked his hardest to get other teachers to be more understanding of my situation and my capacity to do work. I also really appreciated this sub during my treatment.

And when my doctor told me, ""Currently, you no longer have cancer cells in your body,"" I wanted to cry.

F*ck cancer! It ruined my life. I don't understand other people who say ""cancer is a gift."" No way! Cancer will never be a gift. Or maybe it is, but it is a bad gift. I have missed so many opportunities because of it. And the COVID-19 pandemic makes it worse. I still can't go back to my usual life. 

But hearing the phrase, ""you no longer have cancer"" makes me feel invincible again. Although there is still a risk that cancer might recur. 

I am very grateful to my supportive family & friends. If not for them, I would be suffering more. I am also indebted to the medical team for their support. 

I hope everyone here who has cancer will also hear the beautiful words, ""you no longer have cancer.""

What's the best news you have heard so far?",2020-07-13 16:40:21

My first and second scans showed it was stable, which is pretty good news for this type of cancer.

My third scan, showed a moderate reduction in size.  And my scan yesterday showed it was half the size it was 2 months ago!

Considering we were initially hoping to ""slow down it's growth"", the fact that mine is shrinking is huge news.

A friend sees me, and we catch up. She tells me that a patient who recently went into remission and went to rehab has died, due to a complication. 

All of this hurts and takes an emotional toil on us. To see all of your fights. Your wins, and your losses. I guess that makes oncology (cancer) nurses suckers for punishment -- because we love our job! I say all of this, because I want you all to know, that you're not alone.

77,What's it like to have cancer......,190,dpdrq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/dpdrq7/whats_it_like_to_have_cancer/,64,1572502157.0,"I didn't write this but it sums things up perfectly.

What’s it like to go through cancer treatment? It’s something like this: one day, you’re minding your own business, you open the fridge to get some breakfast, and OH MY GOD THERE’S A MOUNTAIN LION IN YOUR FRIDGE.

Wait, what? How? Why is there a mountain lion in your fridge? NO TIME TO EXPLAIN. RUN! THE MOUNTAIN LION WILL KILL YOU! UNLESS YOU FIND SOMETHING EVEN MORE FEROCIOUS TO KILL IT FIRST!

So you take off running, and the mountain lion is right behind you. You know the only thing that can kill a mountain lion is a bear, and the only bear is on top of the mountain, so you better find that bear. You start running up the mountain in hopes of finding the bear. Your friends desperately want to help, but they are powerless against mountain lions, as mountain lions are godless killing machines. But they really want to help, so they’re cheering you on and bringing you paper cups of water and orange slices as you run up the mountain and yelling at the mountain lion - “GET LOST, MOUNTAIN LION, NO ONE LIKES YOU” - and you really appreciate the support, but the mountain lion is still coming.

Also, for some reason, there’s someone in the crowd who’s yelling “that’s not really a mountain lion, it’s a puma” and another person yelling “I read that mountain lions are allergic to kale, have you tried rubbing kale on it?”

As you’re running up the mountain, you see other people fleeing their own mountain lions. Some of the mountain lions seem comparatively wimpy - they’re half grown and only have three legs or whatever, and you think to yourself - why couldn’t I have gotten one of those mountain lions? But then you look over at the people who are fleeing mountain lions the size of a monster truck with huge prehistoric saber fangs, and you feel like an asshole for even thinking that - and besides, who in their right mind would want to fight a mountain lion, even a three-legged one?

Finally, the person closest to you, whose job it is to take care of you - maybe a parent or sibling or best friend or, in my case, my husband - comes barging out of the woods and jumps on the mountain lion, whaling on it and screaming “GODDAMMIT MOUNTAIN LION, STOP TRYING TO EAT MY WIFE,” and the mountain lion punches your husband right in the face. Now your husband (or whatever) is rolling around on the ground clutching his nose, and he’s bought you some time, but you still need to get to the top of the mountain.

Eventually you reach the top, finally, and the bear is there. Waiting. For both of you. You rush right up to the bear, and the bear rushes the mountain lion, but the bear has to go through you to get to the mountain lion, and in doing so, the bear TOTALLY KICKS YOUR ASS, but not before it also punches your husband in the face. And your husband is now staggering around with a black eye and bloody nose, and saying “can I get some help, I’ve been punched in the face by two apex predators and I think my nose is broken,” and all you can say is “I’M KIND OF BUSY IN CASE YOU HADN’T NOTICED I’M FIGHTING A MOUNTAIN LION.”

Then, IF YOU ARE LUCKY, the bear leaps on the mountain lion and they are locked in epic battle until finally the two of them roll off a cliff edge together, and the mountain lion is dead.

Maybe. You’re not sure - it fell off the cliff, but mountain lions are crafty. It could come back at any moment.

And all your friends come running up to you and say “that was amazing! You’re so brave, we’re so proud of you! You didn’t die! That must be a huge relief!”
Meanwhile, you blew out both your knees, you’re having an asthma attack, you twisted your ankle, and also you have been mauled by a bear. And everyone says “boy, you must be excited to walk down the mountain!” And all you can think as you stagger to your feet is “fuck this mountain, I never wanted to climb it in the first place.”

You know. It may have seemed like I sacrificed a lot...

But, I was able to get a new job that changed my career path, which effectively tripled my salary. I met a lovely girl and we’ve been together for over a year now.

88,She was a fighter,183,9w1wof,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/9w1wof/she_was_a_fighter/,39,1541949035.0,"At 5am my world was violently ripped asunder. 

We met in college when we were 19 through a mutual friend and it was love at first sight. I asked her if she wanted to go out sometime and we decided to go to a Mexican restaurant that quickly became one of our favorites. We sat and ate and talked to one another about nothing at all, just enjoying each other's company. After we ate a went to the movies to see jumper. She was staying in a dor. At the time so I took her back to campus, but I didn't want to leave her, I wanted to spend every waking moment with this bright loving beacon, we went and sat on north campus and watched drunk people stumble around until almost 4 in the morning, it was fantastic. 

2 weeks later we walked around campus and found a nice garden, she told me she loved me. I knew I was going to spend my life with her. We did everything together, I loved everything about her. Just being near her or hearing her voice was intoxicating to me.

 I knew I was going to marry her. I shouldn't have waited so long, it took me five years to ask her to be my wife, even though I knew from the second I laid eyes on her. I asked her to marry me during a photo shoot at the botanical gardens, I cherish the pictures I have of that day. 

We were engaged for 2 years before we got married. On March 7th 2015 I got to marry the love of my life, it was outdoors and the weather was perfect. God she was beautiful. We went to Asheville on our honeymoon. 

In January of 2016 she was having pain that we thought were ulcers, they were not. After a series of scans and biopsy results we got the news we feared. On March 7th 2016, our one year anniversary, we were supposed to get results back, we were told to come into the office the next day. It hung over our day like an ominous cloud.
The next day at her appointment we learned that she had colorectal cancer that had spread into her liver. I will never forget us sitting in the office as she wept repeating ""it's not fair, I don't want to die."" Our world and future plans were derailed. 

Over the next year it was chemo every other week. The day after our 2 year anniversary she went in for surgery. Over 6 hours they removed half of her liver, but were not able to remove the part in her colon because she was on the table for so long. She was strong through it all. Always fighting and keeping a good outlook. When I would let my mind wander to dark places she told me that it was ok and she wasnt giving up. 

Things were going ok after that, scans were looking better and no new growth was showing. We started making plans for our future again. Somehow all the chemos didn't take away her fertility, we wanted a family but we wanted a year of clean scans first. 

This year our 3rd wedding anniversary came with fear, as the last 2 had. Things seemed to be going well. A few days after she was having pains again so we went for more scans. They showed the main tumor was back and had spread to her lungs and lymph nodes, still she wanted to fight it. 

In  August we saw that the cancer wasnt responding to treatment. Instead of giving up she asked what else we could do. We were referred to a clinical trial that was 6 hours away from where we live. She stared the trial 3 weeks ago, it seems like a lifetime ago. 

2 weeks ago she was having hearing and vision trouble, we contacted the clinical trial and they said that could be related to the trial and to just let them know if anything changes. She was angry and irritated with everything, we fought I yelled at her because she wanted to give up, for the first time in 10 years i was angry with her. After all we had been through I didn't want it to end like that. I still hate myself for it, even though we talked about it after. 

Monday we were going to go to the dr to get her fluids because she wasnt eating much. She was having bad chest pains so we called an ambulance. When we got to the hospital they did a scan and saw she had 2-3 liters of fluid in her lungs that were pushing on her heart. They put in a chest tube to drain the fluid. That was when we got the awful news, the cancer had spread to her brain. It was blocking the ventricle and she had swelling and fluid in her skull. They put in a brain shunt and we were waiting to get a plurex catheter for her lungs so we could go home. We spent 9 days in the ICU, she new it was almost over but she still wanted to do every option possible to fight. We went to the oncology floor the next day, that's when she started to decline. They weren't going to do radiation on her brain because they said she probably didn't have that long, they said a week at best  still she told us it was ok and that she wasnt giving up. That was the last real talking we got to do with her. Her breathing be ame laboured that night and I signed  a DNR, it was the hardest thing I had ever done, now just 4 days later and I wish that was the hardest part. Friday we were able to get her stable enough to take her home.

She got to be at home and see our cats one last time. It was some of the last things she said and recognized as we put them on the bed with her she called them all by name. Over the next 12 hours she declined. She was on morphine every 2 hours and she even fought it. All of our family and friends were on the way and I think she was trying to hold on to see them. At 5 this morning with her parents and mine all around her she slowed her breathing until she stopped all together. We were holding her hands. When she passed one of our cats, Storm who she loved so much and was so close with her, grabbed her toy and brought it to the foot of the bed for Ash. The cats are walking around lost looking for their mom.

I still don't feel like its real. I'm afraid to go to sleep because that will mean I have to wake up and go to the funeral home. I have some of our friends in the other room staying with me but I just feel so empty and alone. Our last night in the ICU I had fallen asleep against her bed. She woke me up, pulled me close and said it's ok and gave me a kiss and a hug. She told me that this would be her last Christmas so it would need to be a good one. Then she told me the words that felt like my heart was ripped out. She told me to love someone after this. This is not how our story was supposed to end. We are 30 years old and have been together our entire adult life. I haven't gone through anything without her and I don't know how to. Everyone keeps telling me take it one day at a time, but right now I'm struggling to take it one minute at a time. I find myself lost in my head and feel like I'm drowning. If you took the time to read this, thank you. I needed to tell her story, I love her and miss her. My whole heart and body ache. 

This is one of my favorite pictures of us, because technically she never said yes. Her answer to will you marry me was ""I cant breathe""

I love you Ashley, you were my light and inspiration and I hope that I can tell your story and do you proud. See you on the other side monkey butt",2018-11-11 15:10:35

I hope this type of post is allowed... I just really need to get these feelings off my chest.

Bit of a backstory, I am 29 and was diagnosed with Stage IV esophageal cancer in October 2019. By the time they found it, it had already spread into my stomach, liver, and several lymph nodes. They told me from the start that it had progressed too far, and was inoperable.

After 5 months of unsuccessful chemo and radiation, I begin what seems to be my last option for treatment, a type of immunotherapy (I can’t recall the specific name at the moment) on Tuesday.

I met with my doctor today and finally asked the hard questions regarding my prognosis. He told me that if this treatment doesn’t work, I likely have less than six months to live, due to the rate at which the cancer is spreading. Especially in my liver.

Even though I have been expecting and preparing myself to receive this type of news, it has completely broken me. I have cried more today than I have my entire life combined. 

I’ve been sad, scared, angry, all on repeat. I mean, I’m only 29... I’ve barely begun my life, and now it’s being taken away. My fiancée and I had plans to get married in October, but now I don’t know if we should continue or cancel. It seems pointless to plan and spend money on a wedding that might not happen.. or even if it does happen, is it worth it for her to almost immediately become a widow? She’s distraught, and there’s nothing I can do or say to make it better.

In a way, the person I used to be actually died back in October. I’ve been a shell of my former self ever since. I’m not religious and don’t believe in an afterlife, so I’m not scared of being dead. But I am scared of the process of dying. Is it going to be painful? Will there be enough time for my friends and family to come and say our final goodbyes? Or will it happen during this pandemic and I’ll be completely alone in a hospital bed?

I don’t want to come across as being selfish, but it’s just not fair. I’ve stayed strong from day one, but I have no idea how to cope with this.

Her breathing had been ragged and in gasps, and me and our other best friend were trading off reading every other page. Then, in the middle of a page, we both were there and kind of paused for a minute and made sure to tell her we love her one last time, and kept reading because we didn't know how long she would still have, but we knew it wasn't much. Then while we read a few minutes later, she took a breath in, then breathed out, and then her chest stopped rising. I know she passed peacefully, and this would have been exactly how she'd have wanted to go- right by her two best friends holding her hand, and us reading Harry Potter to her. I don't know what to do. Part of me was always scared to be there when she passed, but another part of me was scared I wouldn't be. I'm glad I was there for as long as I could but being honest I kind of feel like throwing up. I saw my best friend die. There was a few minutes we sat there with her body before her mom came back inside from a walk, and then she had us go outside and call our neighbor, who is a nurse, over to her house with a stethoscope to check for a pulse. At that point me and my other best friend knew in our hearts that it happened, even before the nurse came back out to tell us that her pulse was no longer there.",2020-05-04 20:48:59

My body didn’t like it. I still had all the abdominal and bowel issues I would have had with IV treatment. And this time around it got it my head.  I got really down, depressed and angry. That was new for me because I’ve never shed a single tear over my situation and I’ve never had a “Woe is me “ moment. Not one time. I’ve always been positive. But there I was, stuck on the toilet, again, daily for the past month, watching the weather get prettier through the bathroom window. And I thought to myself “uh huh, nope not this time”.

If getting rid of cancer was really that easy? No doctor in their sane mind would ever recommend chemotherapy to their patients.

If it wasn't for chemotherapy and radiation, I would have ended up on a ventilator in the ER, if that because I had a tumor growing rapidly in my chest that had displaced my heart and was putting severe pressure on my windpipe (doctors ive worked said theoretically I could have easily died if I waited another month or two to check with my primary care doctor about the symptoms I was going through). If it got any bigger I could have had a stroke, heart attack, or gone hypoxic (not able to get enough oxygen in my body).

Everyone and their mother has opinions about chemotherapy, but when you're sitting their in the doctors office and they tell you face to face ""this is cancer, these are your treatment options"" the reality of how dire the situation is hits you like a cement truck. 

Yes family and friends can comment ""omg I know someone who went through cancer"" but YOU DID NOT ACTUALLY HAVE CANCER.

I created this account for him, hoping to get him interested and that Reddit might help to entertain him during various treatments, etc. He passed away yesterday, emaciated and exhausted from the ridiculous and (in his case) ineffective chemotherapies and immunotherapies. I'll never know for sure but can only wonder if his last six months would have been more pleasant for him had he forgone any treatment. I'm beating myself up with all the what ifs and I just want to die and be with him. I have a kitchen counter full of his leftover pain medicines so it would be so easy to join him. 

Edit: (follow up?)
Thank you all so much. This experience has changed my thinking drastically. I know that, with time, this will get easier.

I'm not a leaner. (51f) I'm a former Marine that is used to being leaned on, not the other way around. I don't know how to do it. Many of you are telling me to ""reach out to friends and family"" but, to me, there's a problem with that advice. No one I know can even fathom this sadness, this devastating loss. I lost my husband, my best friend, my future, and our shared dream. We retired this year and moved to Las Vegas from Raleigh. 8 days into retirement, he had a seizure and we eventually learned that he had advanced renal cell carcinoma that had metastasized everywhere...his poor brain, lungs, bones, lymph nodes...everywhere. 

Sharing details of his treatments with family and friends was hard for me because I rarely had anything good to say. I believed that I was burdening the people that love us the most and that, sometimes, they were only listening because they were obligated. Did they really want to hear how he threw up his Ensure today? They didn't really want to know how, near the end, his little knees were bigger around than his thighs.

But you guys...this Reddit family...every one of you that reached out to me in the last couple of days...you all did it voluntarily. Pure love for a fellow human being in pain. You came to the party because you wanted to, not because you had to and it's an entirely different connection for me. I'm crying right now as I write this. It's overwhelming the difference you've made and how grateful I am for you.

Also, most of you have survived this nightmare I'm living right now. Because of that and even though we've never met and, more than likely, never will, I feel closer to you right now than most ""friends and family"".

I can't make myself throw all the Oxy out just yet BUT I have moved it all to a shoebox in a closet. Also, you (a collective ""you"") made me see what an honor it was to care for such a great man and that he would want me to be strong and, eventually, even stronger.

It might take a week but, once his ashes are ready, I intend to escort some of them back to NC and deliver them to his grieving parents. Two days ago, I had very different plans. Thank you again.

My girlfriend with rectal cancer that spread to her lungs, liver, and cervical area had always planned to utilize the DWD drug if it came to that. She had always bounced back after every chemotheropy and radiation treatments and even two emergency surgeries. So I have always been optimistic about her beating it, but after the last surgery in December she got a staph infection, was put on heavy antibiotics and was unable to do chemo again until three months ago. At that point she became resistant to irinotecan and began to get hives. there was only one oral chemo that was a viable option that did little except make her feel even more shitty. And that point is when the cancer noticeably spread.

Two months ago her oncologist gave her three to six months. She had taken the initial steps for verbal confirmation to utilize the DWD. We went to the emergency room November 12th for Edema (swelling in legs and feet). She was admitted and immediately put on a saline drip to refill her electrolytes and combat it. After four days in the hospital, she gained 11 lbs in her legs from water retention, pain increased tenfold, delirium was setting in, and she was hardly able to stay awake. Her family decided to put her on hospice. The two days before hospice she was lucid when she was awake. She was adamant about taking the DWD drugs. Being on hospice shortened the wait to five days to obtain them.

Yesterday we obtained the DWD drugs. She is not awake or alert enough to give proper consent, or sip a straw so we are using a squirt bottle to give her water. She can’t control her bowels or urination and is on deaths door. 

This is not my girlfriend.
This isn’t the woman I have loved.
This is not what she wanted.

But I am here for her through it all because I want to make sure she is taken care of. She would’ve taken the DWD drugs the week we were in the hospital but we had to fucking wait. This slow death is much, much harder on everyone especially her. 

If you are contemplating it, have it ready. Have it signed. There isn’t time to wait.

I am like all of the cancer warriors here who believe, never give up ! So, I looked for clinical trials, found one being carried out about 2 hour commuting distance from my residence. I met with the doctor. Some tests were carried out and I was rejected as a candidate for the trial.
But the doctor told me that immunotherapy could be tried as an option and asked me to talk to my doctor about it.

I told my doctor and he was completely negative about it. He told me that it has not shown to work for my kind of cancer and even gave me some clinical trial results printout about it.

Myself, a single widowed father of 2 kids has gone through hell in the past 2 years since my sudden diagnosis. In terms of treatments and everyday pain and suffering that most of you may have probably gone/going through too.

Unwilling to give up the fight, I requested for the immunotherapy treatment. He finally agreed, sent necessary paperwork and luckily I was approved to receive the drug (Keytruda).

I received my first infusion this week. My doctor again reminded me that it will most probably not work (In my mind, ""I know, I know. How many times will you repeat it, Sir ? I am still willing to take my chances"").

Hoping and praying it works for me as it has done for a few cases that I have read about. My kids need me. Onward !

I just want people to listen to my story. Me and my wife were dating since 2014, but we were friends before that. We officially got married in 2018 in beautiful Pennsylvania. We had a great marriage. There were no issues between us; whatever discourse we had we always settled on an agreement. She was always happy. What hurt us the most that at the beginning of 2019 in March, she was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer, which was a few days her birthday. That was the worst thing anyone wanted to hear a few days after their birthday. She was very gung-ho about taking chemotherapy and beating this cancer. She was very hopeful that she would beat this cancer and she had the dream of ringing the bell that was at the breast Care center signaling that it was their last chemotherapy to take on that day. she progressively started getting worse around July right after our 1st wedding anniversary. One week ago as of September sure she was admitted into the hospital for a low temperature and low blood pressure and it scared us both. As she was staying here she slowly started to drift out of consciousness. Her oncologist wanted to speak with me and her parents about her condition and we had asked her about her mortality. she was very hesitant at first to tell us because she was explaining what the cancer was doing to her and then she eventually told us at that time a week ago that she had about a few days to a few weeks left to live. this past week has been gut and heart-wrenching for everyone in her life not only just family but friends as well. She was the most purest person I had ever met she never had any malice towards anyone nor did she hate anyone. Anyone she met she always met with a big and kind smile, and now it looks like she only has 1 to 2 days left to live. I've been very strong for her this entire journey and I told myself that the only time I'd be able to cry would be when it is all over.

We used to work together as bouncers a bit over a decade ago. Forged a friendship out of conflict. Backed each other. Trusted each other. Fought against all odds together.

Smartest guy I ever knew. I went to him for all my tech related conundrums. He taught me calculus while we were drunk because why wouldn't you do maths while you're hammered?

I went with him to his initial consults to give him support. I'm a university trained paramedic, so I have some insight into the medical jargon he's faced with.

He's started staying at my place. We live 120 Km apart but he's home by himself and clearly needs some support. I've got a front room doing nothing so it's his as long as he needs it.

Last Wednesday they confirm it's a carcinoma, not a lymphoma like they were expecting, since the first indication was his enlarged lymph nodes. He's rattled but still physically looking okay.

He comes to stay with me and my other mate. The three of us are as close as brothers. We watch him deteriorate in front of us. No energy. Short of breath the whole time. Eventually he starts to struggle and my other mate has to take him to hospital in the middle of the night.

I didn't even pick it. I knew he was unwell. I encouraged him to go to the doctor. He had no acute signs until well after he got to the ED.

He went into heart failure. I got there about 20 minutes before he died. My other mate was on his way from work. His estranged partner has a long drive ahead and was twenty minutes out.

He told me to tell her he loved her.

He arrested.

I had my blinders on.

Clinically I knew he was dying.

Optimistically I knew he was going to be fine. I stepped out of the room to let the doctors and nurses work. I've run arrest scenes before. I know the last thing you need is an emotional bystander messing it up.

Our other mate had just arrived at the ED. I'd go down and get him. We'd go  up and they'd give me the good news. They'd managed to successfully resuscitate him.

The doctor told me he'd died. It didn't make sense. I was just there and he was alive. He'd spoken to me and he was alive.

When his partner arrived I had to tell her. Longest 20 minute wait I ever had to endure. She arrived hoping for the best. She's a doctor. She knew he'd be fine.

She had her blinders on.

We lost the most intelligent, insightful, analytical crazy arsehole who wound people up because he could. The guy who was smarter than the next three people you could line up, but couldn't be comfortable opening up to anyone.

The man-mountain whom I once saw physically hold back an entire mosh pit, earning him the nickname; Obelix.

The man who refused to wear his glasses and so mistook a 50 foot Jesus backdrop while watching P.O.D as a support band for a gigantic portrait of Jimi Hendricks.

The guy who decided to go for a swim in the local lake at 02:00 prompting a visit from the police, who I was able to convince I was going to get him home safely.

You fuckhead.

I'll always miss you.

He was on a ventilator for less than a day before his nuerosurgeon told us he would be in a vegetative state in less than 24 hours. I've had many conversations where he begged me not to let that happen to him, so me and his family knew what we had to do. We had to let him go. 

Dealing with all of this amidst COVID-19 is a special kind of hell. We weren't let into the hospital to see him until an hour before they pulled his ventilator. Once pulled, he struggled to breathe for an hour. He passed the second he arrived in bed at hospice care.

I can't even begin to contain my joy right now. This past Thursday, my dad had surgery to remove 3 liver tumors (metastatic colorectal cancer).

He didn't bring us to a private speaking room, which was my first sign it was good news. He told us there were only 2 tumors, the third one was just a benign cyst. He removed the tumors and used ablation to burn off the affected areas to ensure everything was destroyed. Since the 3rd one turned out to be a cyst, instead of removed 50% of his liver, they only had to remove 5% of his liver!

Recovery has been okay so far, 5 days in the hospital. Now he's home recovering trying to make it back to normalcy. I want to thank Dr. Gellar with UPMC in Pittsburgh.

As some of you may remember, my mom has been battling metastatic lung cancer (NSCLC - large cell or NOS) since June 2019. She had metastectomy of the spine (6 hour surgery involving titanium planks for stabilization), then IMRT of the spine, then four cycles of immunochemotherapy and now she receives Keytruda only. 

Today, we had the first control PET scan after four cycles of chemo and Keytruda and two Keytruda-only infusions.

ALL her metastatic sites have DISAPPEARED. Her huge spine met (78x54mm) has gone. Her adrenal gland met has gone. Her bone mets have gone. Her mediastinal lymph nodes have cleared. All satellite nodules in the lungs have gone. Her main tumor has shrunk from 88x64mm to 19mm at most. 

Her doctors looked at the PET report today and could not believe their eyes. I cried. Mom cried. They looked confused. We looked flabbergasted. It was just a huge mess of happiness, confusion and sheer “how did this happen” reactions. The results surpassed my wildest dreams. Especially since mom’s PD1 negative so she had a very small chance of responding to immunotherapy.

Next, we’ll do SBRT of the original site and doctors hope to end that saga with that last, final blow. My mom will stay on Keytruda for at least two years in the absence of any adverse event.

Still cannot believe what’s happening. My emotions today have ranged from sheer happiness to shock (like I cannot internalize that information) to fear of that beast returning. How do you deal with all of that? 

Also, thank you for all the relentless support while I scribbled posts while under massive scanxiety. I will keep you updated as we move forward.",2020-01-30 21:13:08

I thought it was kidneystones, so did they, until the ultrasound didn't show any, but x-ray caught part of a mass in my lower left lung. I went in for CT scans and then a PET scan, which came back negative. I had a biopsy on Christmas Eve and another 3 days later because the first had to be stopped due to me not being sedated deeply enough. With the PET scan being negative, my pulmonologist was really not expecting cancer, but today I found out they found neuroendocrine carcinoid tumors with metaplastic bone formation. I have a large spherical mass about 3.8cm diameter in my lower left lung, and other growths in my airway. It is spread to my lymph nodes.

The doctors from the different disciplines are all getting together to have a meeting to discuss the diagnosis/prognosis/treatment. So I don't know exactly what stage it is classified as, but I know it's not good.

So it's a tough NYE, and I'm wondering if I will see another. Probably being overdramatic, but it's definitely in my thoughts. I'm trying to take it all in and enjoy my family and the festivities.

Listen to your Dr's!! They actually want to cure you so do as you're told.

Research cannabis oils, expecially Thc,  I can't say if these help remove the cancer but for the quality of life they have given me and the help. With sleep, anxiety, food has been amazing! Use them!

Make getting better your No1 priority!   This is before your husband/wife/children/career /social life absolutely everything.  You need to be relaxing, de stressing and recovering, all of the above will be there when you're better.

Oxandrolone-   this is a product given to patients with aids/cancer or other diseases that cause muscle wastage.  I lost 8 stone during my treatment this product helped massively in holding onto some weight and building myself back up again.

I have posted here a while ago my father’s story and you have been incredibly kind and helpful towards me. I want to thank you for taking the time to write or comment me your thoughts.

My father died on the 10th of September, at 5 a.m. Before this, he was diagnosed on the 24th of August with stage 4 pancreatic cancer and was in and out if hospital until he died. His condition worsened day by day, at the point in which I have been shocked to see what this disease does to the human body. It is horrible to see someone you love weaker and sicker as the days go by. By the start of this week, he was already sleeping most of the time, barely speaking and seemed out of this world. I spent time with him, hold his hand and made him laugh for the last time. I am at peace with the fact that his death was natural and painless. He just sighed and stopped breathing. He also seemed at peace with his condition. 

I am still trying to process what happened. I look around the house and expect to see or hear his voice. A month ago he was alive and healthy (we thought), complaining of no pain or symptoms of what was about to come. I initially thought that he will have at least 3 months still to live, but the cancer was extremely aggressive and took out every resource he had. 

Dad, I don’t really know where you are atm. I love so much and you will be forever in my heart. 

For all of you that have experienced this kind of situation, you have all my love and admiration! I have realized that we feel the same, no matter where we are on this planet or what our beliefs are. We suffer and ache just as humans should when a loved one is taken away from us. All the love to you!",2019-09-12 03:06:44
158,I'm driving myself home from the appointment in which I was told I am dying.,151,6qzu8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/6qzu8s/im_driving_myself_home_from_the_appointment_in/,32,1501655411.0,"To be fair, I'm not driving. The Clara Barton parkway has the little lots by the Potomac. There's a steady, heavy rain on the roof of this borrowed car. It won't last long. Blue sky and sunshine are at the horizon, even while lightening flashes above.

I don't want to go home. If it was just my husband I'd rush to him. But my mom is there and my kids. 

My kids. Every time I think of them the screen of my phone blurs away.  Just today my daughter cried when I left for my appointment. She doesn't do that often, because appointments for me are usually 2-3 times weekly. But she was feeling exceptionally attached today. She sat on my lap this morning. She asked if I would nap with her. She 6, she doesn't even nap anymore. But she wanted time with just me, away from the 5 other kids my mom provides daycare for at our house.

Instead, I read to her. I'm trying to ease her into chapter books. But after one short chapter, I acquiesced to her demand that I read some Bernstein Bears. It hurt to read that long. By the time I was done I was taking long, raspy breaths every few sentences. I read through the pain to my son last night, too, continuing my lifelong ambition to read Harry Potter aloud to my kids. My daughter doesn't like it, but my son(8) and I just started the Goblet of Fire.

My doctor wants me to get a tracheotomy. Permanent this time. But it won't remove all the fingers of cancer gripping my throat. It will just keep me from dying in an ambulance due to this growing airway obstruction. Or, as he says, ""for comfort."" I wonder how much effort reading will be with the tracheotomy.

I've had other doctors tell me I'm dying before. But I never could conceive of it being imminent. There is something about struggling to breathe that makes the whole thing much more concrete than past times. 

I've also had more fight in me before. I've known I could make it through more chemo, more radiation, more surgery. Four and a half years into this and I don't feel so certain. Surgery won't take this out.  Neither will radiation. So... chemo is left and I can safely say I'd rather be dead than back on a platinum based chemotherapy.

I don't want to go home. It used to be the thing I feared the most was my kids not remembering me. Now it's the conversation that is looming, closer than ever. The moment when we sit them down and have to tell them I'm done trying.

I don't want to go home, because maybe that day is today. Maybe tonight I'll sign a DNR and tomorrow I'll tell my oncologist that we are switching to palliative treatments only.

I didn't think this was coming today. Not really. And I have to make my decision before I get home.


(10 miles later)

I stopped again, after the rain cleared. I bought myself chocolate, and I got a shirt for my son, a stuffed animal for my daughter, and a candy bar for my husband. I'm not sure what my goal is here. Is this supposed to ease this news?

A month ago my doctors told me that everything looked clear. No new growth. I wasn't expecting that. I thought (at the time) the news was bad. My husband came with me to that appointment. He called my dad on the way home with the good news.

When we pulled in, my kids came running out to the car. They were screaming, giddy from the news. We went inside and they could just not calm down. Neither could I. We did a dance party in the kitchen and I gave them ice cream before bed.

But tge pain and swelling kept getting worse. And here I am, hoping some candy and trinkets will ease the anxiety for my kids. The memory of that night a month ago makes my dread for tonight so much worse.

(30 miles later)

I'm only 10 minutes from home when I get back in my car.  There is a little place where you can look over the valley of our town. I live on the mountain on the other side. I'm staring over at my mountain, hearing and seeing my familyn still not finding the words to say to my kids. 

 Somebody ate all the chocolate. Maybe if I stall long enough they'll be in bed.

Anyway, I should get back in the car. Thanks to anyone who listened to my stream of consciousness thus far.

(Home)

I flicked off my lights as I pulled in the driveway. I'm hoping nobody notices I'm sitting out here. As soon as I slam shut the door of the car, this isn't my private pain anymore. It belongs to those I love the most, too.

I've tried before to lie, to not let them know when it is serious. I never make it long. 

I wanted to make a decision about what direction to go before I got home.  I haven't. Here is what I have decided: to go on a walk with my husband. To take my kids to the lake tomorrow. To put off an appointment with my oncologist one more day.

My husband just texted me. Deep breaths. In I go.

161,Its finally over..,153,ipsk6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/ipsk6l/its_finally_over/,24,1599725829.0,"Hey,

 I was diagnosed last August with DLBCL 14cm x 13,7cm x 7cm. in my abdomen. I went to see a doctor on 10th August, got my ultrasound on 16th and on 23rd had biopsy. It went so fast and Im extremely grateful to my doctor, who instantly thought it was cancer and sent me to ultrasound.

I started my chemotherapy on 30th August, 5 cycles of methotrexate, vincristine, etoposide, cytarabine, fosfamide and doxorubicin, it was hell. It shrunk my tumor by 95%, but there were still 5% left. So i got it removed surgically. They took half of my liver and gallblader. 

After that I had 6 months of immunotherapy (opdivo/nivolumab). Today i had my last appointment with my oncologist and he said that im finally done with it. Immunotherapy worked, but due side effects we had to end it. I got another ultrasound of my abdomen and they didnt find anything unusual. I have PET/MRI on 30th September, but my doctor said It is going to be 99% fine.

Im just so happy that it is done. These past 12 months were hell, but even in those bad times I made new friends, met new people and had near death experience, which change my view of the world. Im more grateful about everything I have and everyone near me.

For those who are still fighting, you can do it! I believe in you. I remember browsing this subreddit after my first chemo and thinking this is taking forever, I was in so much pain and thought it is never going to end but here I am. If i look back, everything went so fucking fast. 

I had to share this with someone, im so happy!

It took months to wrap my head around the fact that I may actually be able to live without a looming storm cloud over my shoulder.

Then Wednesday happened...

Turns out, my last scan showed some pretty aggressive activity, and in new areas. 

At this point I have no more options. 

I will be doing maintenance every 3 weeks of combination nivolamab and brentuximab until either 

1. the side effects become too much
2. it (the treatment) just stops working

There's not really a time-frame. Could be months, could be years. We haven't told the kids anything yet. After the holidays and birthdays are over in January, we will tell them the cancer is back and I'm doing treatments, but that's all they need to know for now. 

I just got used to the idea that I was going to live, this has been one hell of a cruel whiplash. I feel so terrible for my wife. Honey, I love you so so so so much. I wish we could've made better use of our time together. I wish I didn't waste our chance at finally having the life we wanted together in hospitals. I am so grateful for you doing everything you could to give our family a taste of normalcy, and even fun.

I didn't think I would be here... after everything... the transplants, the physical, emotional, and psychological hell...

I did have a good run, while it lasted. I've known love and loss, and I've laughed till I cried. I've traveled. Not as much as many, but enough to have gotten see some amazing things. I've known good and bad people, I've *been* good and bad people. 

so, what *does* an (albeit flawed) Buddhist with Asperger's, cancer, a wife and two kids think about his own mortality? I'd probably start to tell you, but I really don't think I'd have enough time (haha) 

so I guess this is it. Not everyone has the position of knowing when their time is pretty much up. I won't be tapping out early, I have no interest or need to do so. I do plan on trying to be happy. I don't think that means cramming everyday with excitement and adventure, but I do think there's a certain amount of seizing the day that i should consider.",2019-12-15 03:15:49

In 2011, he got diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and tumors had also spread to his brain. The hospital he got diagnosed at gave him a couple months to live, and had a extreme chemo and radiation set up. 


My dad quit smoking instantly, and left that hospital. He took all that info and medical records to City Of Hope hospital and got a second opinion. The doctors at City of Hope were astonished at the radiation/chemo intensity and told my dad the other hospital would have made him a vegetable if he had followed through. 


They did surgery to remove the tumors on the brain and some radiation. And gave him low dose chemo and radiation for the lung tumors. 

After that, he was in remission for 3 years. In 2014 he had another mass on his lung. More radiation and a bit of chemo. 


Since then, he has been in remission. Two months ago he had a scan and his doctor was scared because he saw some masses on his brain that resembled cauliflower and we had to do a biopsy to find out what it was. 

A month later ? He had another scan and it was gone. The doctor says it’s a miracle and my dads a walking miracle.

Even though he might not be 100% who he was before the diagnosis, he’s still here. He might not have the same energy, stamina, and mental sharpness as he once did but he’s still here. He loses his balance sometimes, and forgets things. But that’s expected after the surgeries on the brain. He’s my hero and it’s a miracle he’s still here

I had finished treatment and at my first three-month checkup, my doctors told me that they saw little tumors in my bones. Until this point, they’d (mercifully) held off on explaining that my diagnosis is terminal. But when they saw the first metastases, they explained that curing me was impossible, and that they would only work to buy me time. If they trials didn’t work, I would have no more than 6 months.

But they have worked. I still have cancer, more metastases growing slowly in my body. I continue to feel good, to have energy, to feel happy. In the past year, I’ve climbed America’s tallest sand dune (entirely before breakfast), sipped tea on the beaches of Sri Lanka, built a pergola by hand in my own backyard, and adopted a dog of my very own. I’ve gotten to know my friends, and especially my family, in a deeper more genuine sense; we’ve all changed the things we value, and hold each other much closer than we did before. I’ve gotten much better at knowing myself. 

I guess my point is that I didn’t know any of this was coming. I didn’t expect any of this change, any of these blessings. I didn’t know how much of it would come from me. What’s going to happen can be forecast, but we don’t really know. The shadow of grief that I felt one year ago today is still there, but by wrestling with it, I’ve become more comfortable living with it. I have made space inside myself to allow it, and it is accompanied by joy and self-satisfaction. What we are facing here is very difficult, and I’m no guru or miracle worker who can promise it will get better. But the lesson I’ve taken from the past year still holds true: if you focus on dying, you aren’t using your time and energy to really live. So you gotta choose to do one or the other. 

I’m still going to die. But I don’t know when, and until I go, I’m gonna try to live every goddamn second. We don’t truly know how our lives are going to go, and we have to make sure some of the “what if” rabbit holes are good.

I am just so very happy to still be here with my family.  My wife and kids, as well as my friends, are what have kept me optimistic throughout this ordeal.  I don't even want to think of where I'd be if I hadn't managed to keep a positive attitude.  

So, Cheers! fellow cancer warriors.  Nobody should have to deal with what we're dealing with, but here we are.  All I hope to do is to, Live and Love, leave behind photographs and memories, and make this earth a better place than I found it.",2018-11-23 08:56:53

As if the job loss didn't already upset her, she was diagnosed with stage 3b colon cancer. She has been getting more depressed as the days go by. 

And today, on Christmas, in front of our young kids, my wife announced that she was leaving us. She said she was thankful to spend Christmas with us, but now that it's done, she doesn't want to be a burden to us anymore. She doesn't want the children to see her getting more sick. 

No matter what I said, or the children crying, she refused to listen. She already had two bags packed, and she walked out. I am completely lost and shocked and heart broken. I don't know where she's going... she won't answer her phone.  I tried calling the cops and they told me that since she left on her own, there's nothing they can do. I'm going to keep checking the bank account to see if she's buying anything anywhere. 

 The kids and I are just so confused. 

UPDATE: She withdrew $1000 from a bank branch this morning. While she has money to survive, she just made us short on money for the mortgage and other debts. I'm hoping my parents can help with that. ",2018-12-26 07:48:42

She’s no longer in pain and that’s the only thing that’ll ever keep me going is remembering how much she was suffering in her last few months. Sending love and hugs to all those still fighting the battle and those who are beside them hurting as well. 

Last night something weird happened. I would save all these little notes my mom wrote to me. She would write me good luck or I love you in the morning before leaving for work on the days she knew I had an exam and I have all the notes in the drawer by my bed. I haven’t opened that drawer in the last few days, nothing I needed from there. Somehow a green note ended up outside the drawer facing down, thinking it was garbage I go to pick it up as I was tidying my room and I look and it said “good luck (my name) ❤️” it was on a bright green sticky note that I didn’t notice earlier. It sent chills through my body.

I've posted quite a bit in here about my dad's journey. He's a 50 year old man diagnosed with stage 3C colorectal cancer February 2018. After 6 months of chemo and radiation, he beat cancer.

For a few months, that is. May 2019 it came back in his liver, boosting us up to stage IV. I was devastated. But after 6 more months of chemo, an outstanding surgery, and a bit more chemo, he was cancer fucking free in November 2019.

Flash forward to now, he had his first scan and blood work. I was so terrified. But his CEA level decreased even more to an all time low of 0.5!! I know we aren't out of the woods yet, but this small victory is enough to make me jump out of my seat and dance a jig. 

Thank you so much to this amazing community for all the support. I hope this story can serve as inspiration to everyone.

She was raising her arm high up (she normally don't even have the energy to even move her hand) continously. My dad took care of her at night until 330am and he went to his room to sleep because she looked comfortable. In the morning at 7am we realised she wasn't breathing anymore. We called the ambulance and they said it seems like she passed away 3 hours ago which was around 4am. I think my mom decided to let go when we weren't around.

The prognosis was 20-22 months, not curable but treatable the Dr. said.

He died inside the day that he received that diagnosis, something in him just broke. I don't know if it was the meds, the disease or just the shock of the diagnosis but he just was not the same. He would be in and out, not fully lucid and just completely depressed which was heartbreaking to see since he was always such a jovial guy.

He had a lot of pain from his esophageal stent placement. He went through a round of chemo which was miserable for him but it finally seemed like he was getting better. And then he got a pulmonary embolism. He miraculously survived that but at that point he was just not ok. I didn't know what to do, he was just in so much pain, he was so tired. At that point the doctors are like he has a month or two without treatment. Maybe he'll get to Christmas if he's lucky. 

He managed to get out of the ICU where I was finally able to see him again only to go into septic shock 2 days later. He was unconscious and on a ventilator for about a week. We were ready to just extubate and ""let him go"" but then he became conscious again. He was not able to speak due to the tube but he could kind of write and he would understand us. He wanted to be extubated but the doctors didn't think that he could make it and my mom was not ready to do that.

He had a lot of ascites in his abdomen and chest. The ICU doctors suggested to put a drainage on his abdomen and drain his chest to make him more comfortable, and that it should help him to breathe on his own for a while. We finally made the decision to extubate him on Friday. I was able to finally be with him again briefly since my mom was the only allowed visitor. He was himself for a bit again. The next few days were really hard as he declined again. He needed a bipap machine to maintain his oxygen levels. He was delirious at times and he eventually just became agitated and wanted to take off his lines and go home. He asked my mom to just let him go, that he was just tired and ready to go.

Yesterday mom and I finally decided that it was time to move him to hospice. We signed the papers, they removed his lines, switched him to an oxygen cannula and moved him to a private room. He thanked us, and told us that he was just tired and he couldn't do it anymore. We reassured him, told him we loved him and that he could go, that we were gonna be ok. We told him not to be afraid, that his parents and his siblings were there for him, waiting to guide him to a place without pain, only light.

He eventually faded away until there was only his breathing, every time the breaths were more and more spaced apart. We held his hands, gave him foot massages (his favourites) and put cold compresses on his forehead. Just an hour later it seemed like he was just not going to be with us much longer, mom and I held his hands bedside and reassured him again of our love and that he did not have to stay with us longer, that he could go in peace.

Eventually he took his last breath. Mom and I looked at each other because we were not sure that he was gone. We tried to check his pulse but we were both too agitated to do so. Eventually the nurse confirmed that he had no pulse and told us she had to do some paperwork. We stayed there with him, fully knowing that he was not there anymore but still giving him kisses and messages of love.

My dad died on September 15th, 6 weeks after his diagnosis. 8 weeks ago, he was still mowing his own lawn, he was still sending me stupid jokes through whatsapp. He had some problems swallowing and eating but doctors just dismissed it as an esophageal spasm or a hernia.

I am so broken because the last couple of months I could have had with him I isolated a lot due to fear of giving my parents covid19, what I would give for him to be back at my parents place and us cuddled up in the couch watching TV and petting our doggie. I have dreams where I go to my old parents place (where we lived 11 years ago) and I find him sitting on his computer working on his latest project.

My dad was a brilliant man, a loving man, and in the end this disease ate his body up faster that we thought it was possible. I try to be consoled by the fact that his fight his over and he is reunited with his parents and siblings.

But I don't know how I am going to move forward with this pain. I mean, I have to, but I don't know how I am going to.",2020-09-16 23:18:30

So that entire summer I was busy kicking cancers ass which I took like an absolute champ and then I moved to Northfield Vermont and started school at Montpelier High School those who know military kids know that making friends is not the easiest thing to do but there are a few kids that welcomed me and to them I say thank you so much it actually means so much to me. So throughout the school year it was quite hard to not only keep up with all my classes junior year but also trying to get into school as often as possible was quite difficult as well. I also met probably one of the best person ever and that is my Girlfriend Savannah Tedder I have kept out relationship pretty private but I just want to say that she has helped me out this last 7 months so much and she means so much to me. I have also had many many awesome opportunities this year including meeting David Ortiz and some world champion Red Sox players as shitty this year has been I’m glad I have had some once in a lifetime experiences.

Everything was going well, we started chemo in October every 2 weeks for 36 hours. This holiday season was rough but we both made it through. In January we had a second PET scan done and the results were great. The doctor was really happy that the cancer had shrunk and everything was going according to plan. We were happy because only 6 more chemo treatments and we could ring the bell!! Well mid February things got worse, cancer had spread to the bones and nervous system. He has been in the hospital since then. 

Yesterday was a good day, he was smiling and some what talking to us. But today everything changed. When I went to see him, he could talk and was heavily breathing. The nurse was talking about time lines to his parents and I. That’s when it happened. It hit me like a truck. This guy whom I’ve been with for 8 freakin years will not be coming home. This guy who I shared a home with won’t be back in it. Also the guy who I really love won’t be here anymore.

I'm 20 and now own a cat, an apartment full of stuff, and a business - which thankfully my mom is running for me. I go away to the school of my dreams in September. I've been very calm, and am relieved his suffering is over, the only thing to spike my emotions was the awful breathing in the last days even though I knew he wasnt in pain. His cat is also unusually affectionate to me, (shes always play fought with me as affection) and she keeps turning the corner looking for him in his room, which got me pretty bad. Last night he went non-reponsive and I had a conversation with him. I told him I know he loves me and everyone, and that we all love him so much that we want him to be comfortable, and that it is his choice if he wants to go. That he raised me to be a fighter and although I'll miss him, I'll be okay and I'll make sure his cat and his mentally disabled brother are okay. This morning I was woken up by the call, so I hope he heard me. I'm spreading his ashes in a cemetary/nature reserve in an area he loved in the morning before the funeral, which will be held on April Fools Day. I know he would find that hilarious. I have no doubt that there will be hundreds in attendance from AA and other communities he touched with his humor and divine kindness.

To hear these words spoke about ones self can't be described. I was numb, scared, shattered, and at the same time I had no idea what the hell was going on. To put a long story short, after two liver resections to remove five liver tumors, (one of which was in a tricky spot) 32 radiation treatments, chemo treatments, and a rectal resection, my latest CT scan shows that I am cancer free. I couldn't have done it without my family, friends, and girlfriend who stayed overnight on the couch in my hospital room for weeks on end. 

I just wish everyone who has been given the same original diagnosis could be blessed with the same uplifting news I received this morning. What scares me

The immunotherapy drugs were only slowing down the growth of her cancer so Hospice was brought it.  They met with her at our home and decided that they wanted to bring her to their center to manage her pain.  I didn't know that would be the last rational conversation I would have with her... I would have thought of something better to say.  The level of morphine needed to manage her pain made it very difficult to communicate.  She became confused, unable to speak, and slept a lot.  She wanted to come home... she said as much by getting up and packing her bags.  She died here, in our old bedroom. It was November 4th. She was surrounded by family and friends.  Her last words were, 'I love you Andy'.  That's me, by the way.  I am sorry that I didn't  do this sooner.  This group helped her a lot.

It’s been many years since I posted to Reddit or even looked at it. But years ago I did an AMA about my diagnosis with terminal cancer. I had been given two years to live (approximately). 

I have had numerous surgeries, have done 7 or 8 chemos, but 11 years later, I am still here. 

I was diagnosed with breast cancer that spread to liver and lungs. It is HER2+, one of the more rare and deadly forms. However, that turned out to be a good thing, as a year or so after diagnosis they started to do research and came out with anti-HER2+ drugs. Not everybody responds, but I did. 

I still go to chemo and have many of the problems that come with that. I’m not healthy, but I’m still here. I went from having a 12 year old who I merely wanted to see graduate HS, to watching him graduate from Caltech and get a good job in tech. 

I saw my oldest, who was 22, also get a good job, married a wonderful woman and then have children. My hair is grey, and I’m getting old (Although I still look pretty young!). I’ve lived a pretty good life and got many years that others didn’t. I’m grateful but think about my friends who died every day. 

But it’s starting to change, progress is being made and others will get those years too. 

The point is, hang in there. Do your treatments. You never know what can happen, and what’s around the corner. 

My nurses call me a miracle. I don’t believe in miracles, but I was at the right place at the right time. And I never wrote myself out. You can do that too. Good luck to all of you!",2020-07-28 08:17:18

Sharing my own experiences and giving advice has also been a form of healing for myself.

I wanted to offer these to those who truly need it on reddit as a thank you. 
I will be offering packages of 3 pieces per person. First come first serve. 

I will of course wash everything before sending as well, and I will cover the shipping. If someone can also let me know how I can cover everything? There have been times I have received a package from the states and I had to pay customs before receiving the package. ( I am from Canada)

Thank you again and I look forward to sending these out!

Instead of asking ""why him, why me, I'm too young to lose a father!"" I'm thinking of how blessed I am to have had such a great man be my dad for 28 years. 28 years of beautiful memories - silly dad jokes, endless country concerts, numerous sporting events, the long drives taking me to & from college.

I'm still receiving treatment. We'll reevaluate in March. They expect a recurrence at some point and will treat me with Keytruda then. Keytruda only works in 20% of urethelial cancer patients, but when it works, it can be a cure--a word I've never heard my oncologist say.

He was a healthy 50 year old man, who worked out regularly, didn't consume alcohol or drugs and took care of himself.

For 14 years he went through several treatments,  chemo, radiation, autotransplants of the medula, immunotherapy, and more. He always kept a positive view on it. Luckily the most part of his treatments were not too severe on him. They were brutally aggressive, that's for sure, but I think his positive attitude towards life and the desease really helped it not be worse than it could have been.

During his remission periods he decided to put into books his lifelong studies. He has been interested in theosophy and understanding who we are, what are we doing here and where we're going to when we die, for the most part of his life. He found an editor and he published 8 books and translated quite some books for the editor too. He found some meaning in the middle of all this. Everytime his health permitted he travelled with my mom (I would join them whenever I could too), gave seminars and really enjoyed his time here.

Last September he restarted treatment. This was one of the worst on him. I think he was tired too.  Battling cancer for 14 years it's not easy, even for the strongest. Everything happened super slowly, he was weak everyday, getting out of the bed just to go to the bathroom was a nightmare. My mom was really a hero here, taking care of all his needs, being there for him through this everyday, doing hospital runs and being his rock. Me and my sister live abroad so we missed this last journey.

Last month he was admitted to the hospital and one morning my mum was called to go over there. The hospital was closed for visitations because of the pandemic. She got there and he passed 10 minutes after. He waited for her to come to hold her hand one more time. 
We couldn't do a proper goodbye cerimony because of covid-19 social distancing measures, so we selected one of his favorite songs and had family and friends play it at the same time, from their homes. I brought some of his ashes to Switzerland so I can scatter them in the mountains, one of his favorite things.

Today marks 1 month he left this life. 

I just wanted to share his story and strength to mark this date. It is really amazing the length our Human strength can go.",2020-04-19 14:40:55

My mom consumed about 800 calories today, which is probably the most calories she has eaten (or drank I should say) for months!!!

The main key was portion control. Even her high calorie boost drink. I would give her a quarter at a time in a separate cup every few hours. 
 
Her breakfast was a soft boiled egg with cheese toast, which I cut into small little squares. (Only ate about half but it was still a good amount of calories!)

I made a creamy tomato basil soup for lunch/dinner, which I gave a small portion in a bigger mug so it looked like an even smaller portion!! This is the first she would finish a bowl of anything!!

I also provided her fresh carrot/orange juice (about half a cup) every couple hours.  And Everytime she had to take medication (every 4 hours) I always suggested to take it with the juice rather than water. 

I am beyond proud of her. And if she can do it, you can too!!

When I got diagnosed, I had been dating a girl for 3 months. I told her to leave me, because I didn't know how the cancer would turn out and she should leave before we become too invested in the relationship. She refused to leave, and she stayed by my side. That lovely lady is now my wife! We got married just after Christmas. We expected the surgery and chemotherapy to make me infertile.

There was a post on here about how difficult it is to not give into despair when you have cancer and your situation sucks and yeah I just wanna get in on that! 

I have been paranoid about cancer all my life after I watched it kill my mother when I was little, I ended up a real hypochondriac because of that awful experience. And guess what! I still got cancer! I didn’t even manage to find it early, I found it stage four! Which quickly turned to terminal! My cancer normally hits women when they’re 50ish but I got mine 23!!! I didn’t even get the fucking time my mother did! So now I have to come to terms with my imminent death and also the fact that I’m going to destroy my wonderful fucking family when I die! We have already done this, we know the fucking score, they will miss me forever and they have to watch me slowly die now because I couldn’t even die in a freak accident! No, I had to have a long drawn out death which ends in pain and indignity! LOVE IT. 

Before cancer I wasn’t religious but I didn’t think on god much. Now I have so much rage for him. I know it’s becsuse I have no one else to direct the rage at but honestly, fuck him for doing this. For making my family suffer and delighting in that suffering being slow. Fuck him for giving everyone else cancer and letting some people do months of horrible treatment only to die anyway. You motherfucker. You sadistic piece of shit. When I die I’ll cut your head off and piss on your grave. I just want to cover your holy house with shit and drag you down to earth and show you the fucking five year old being held down so they can get their toxic medicine and the parent whose a good person and has kids but you’re still killing them anyway. If god is real, I think I’ll kill him. 

And you are the only guys who will see this rant. Because anger doesn’t help anyone, and people can only relate to cancer patients if we’re doing an upbeat Be Positive dance. I hate the hold that death has on me. Even now I’m scared God might send me to hell for this anger at his Greatness, this *disrespect*... I feel like I gotta be worshipping at his feet even as he kills me cruelly and makes it so my family is in pain for years. THANKS DUDE!

This went on for months. Every day my mom or dad would drive me to the hospital to sit and wait to be seen, then the hospitals would just send me home. Finally after staying in the ER waiting room every single day a doctor walked by me and looked at my eyes and started screaming at the ER nurses and told them to get me into a room because I was dying. I had lost 70lbs in less than a month. I was in so much pain that I would slip in and out of consciousness and apparently I would black out and just start screaming from the pain. The doctor who had them pulled me into the back ended up becoming my oncologist. After every test they could possibly do... They tell me it's stage 4 non-hodgkin Lymphoma, that the cancer was throughout my entire body and in my bones, that I'll never walk again because my sciatic nerve was crushed and then severed against my spine by a 6"" by 3"" tumor that was infused in my lower back muscles. I was told I was going to die by all the other doctors but the one who became my oncologist. I forget the name of the chemo but I believe it was supposed to be every month and a half and my chemo sessions were about 10 hours long. They later bumped it to once every 3 weeks. While I was in the hospital I ended up flat lining for 2 minutes... I can tell you when your body releases DMT ""naturally"" it's a strange trip... But my heart started again. Eventually I was in remission. I was still in wheel chair and on such strong 24 hour time release pain killers that I had to take 3 times a day that I would be mid sentence 15 minutes after taking one and I'd knock out, then I'd come to and continue talking like nothing had happened only to find out whoever was there visiting had left so I could sleep lol. My buddy had leukemia twice by the time this all was happening to me. I knocked out while he was over mod sentence and came back to with a sandwich sitting next me and him eating his sandwich. And the moment I started talking again like nothing had happened he started laughing his ass off. Apparently the same thing had happened to him so he knew exactly what was happening. Well, after about 2 years of being on these pain killers I decided I was done and quit cold turkey even tho I was told not to. My life was either me in a wheelchair or a lazy boy recliner because I couldn't lay down because of how painful it was. So with cabin fever and insane withdrawal all I could do was lift myself up and down in this chair for 12 hours or more a day for a couple months while watching nothing but shitty day time shows. I'd finally had enough of that and asked my parents to get me a walker. So I forced myself to start walking again using that. Fast forward a few months and started walking without a cane. So that was a summary of all the terrible stuff. While I was in the hospital and going through chemo tho, I always founds ways to mess with people. I always found was to mess with my doctors and friends and would always turn everything I could into a joke. I'll leave a couple of stories in the comments for anyone who's actually gotten this far.",2020-09-12 09:24:46

We both had a feeling of dread going into this appointment.  Over the last few months her recovery time from the chemo has been getting worse and worse.  This last treatment she never truly recovered from.  There was not a single day we would call a ""good"" day even by our lowered standards over the past 4 weeks.  Further more she had been experiencing more pain in her back and a tightness in her abdomen. So we went in to this appointment with the anticipation that her cancer was growing again and that she was also getting toxic from nine months of continuous chemo.

&#x200B;

We waited in the room for 45 minutes as the doctor was running behind.  When he walked into the room you knew immediately he did not have good news for us by his demeanor.  He was kind as always, but had to be direct concerning the scans.   The cancer in her spine is growing and has spread.  The cancer in her liver grew with numerous new tumors that were all almost 0.8cm in size.  The worst part was that her bilirubin count, which had always been stable, doubled in between her last two bloodwork samples.  This concerned him the most.  We were not four minutes into the meeting when he looked at her and said, ""Unfortunately I think we are at the point I have to ask you if your affairs are in order.""  Needless to say it was a gut punch for both of us.

&#x200B;

Basically she is a time bomb right now.  Her liver is starting to fail.  The tumors could grow and block the ducts or the tumors could just grow and cause the liver to stop functioning.  The increased bilirubin counts indicates that is starting to happen.  We go back in two weeks for more bloodwork and to visit the oncologist.  The oncologist said that if those numbers continue to rise dramatically we will likely have to make some hard choices at that visit.  

&#x200B;

Honestly the choices are not that hard.  There is another chemo we can try, but if it's going to only buy her time where she's miserable and unable to function she is not interested in that.  She is not strong enough for chemo now.  So we are taking two more weeks off of chemotherapy and will decide if we are permanently discontinuing at the next meeting.

It had all the signs of being benign up until it was removed. My laparoscopic surgery was last Tuesday and I’ve recovered alright so far. My OBGYN called me and my mom in yesterday at four to discuss the pathology results and then I heard that awful word: malignant. Apparently the type of Ovarian cancer I have is in the 1% so I literally feel like all the odds are against me. Luckily it is stage 1 and they are hoping I won’t have to undergo chemo, but I will have to go back in for surgery again to get my right ovary removed (which my doctor spend 3 hours trying to save). I’m just scared that it will escalate because so far, all of the things that I’ve been told are “unlikely”, “uncommon”, or  “1-5%” have all happened to me. So they are saying it’s unlikely I will have to go through chemo and all that but I’m an uncommon case. After I found out, I sat in my mom’s car and literally was waiting to wake up from a dream. Still waiting to wake up. It doesn’t feel real and I’ve been telling everyone about it and it almost feels like I’m lying because it’s so unreal. I’m terrified and I had a breakdown last night and I have been on the verge of tears for so long. Before all of this, my graduation, Prom, and Italy trip got cancelled. I haven’t seen a lot of my friends and people I love because of quarantine. I got accepted into NYU and Pratt, and want to go to Pratt but it’s in New York and don’t know if I will even be able to go on campus this year.

I'm 19 years old and my mom has multiple malignant nodules in her breasts and underarms.

I am an occasional drinker of coke zero and I dared not tell her how much aspartame is in a can of that. 

Even people who eat healthy get cancer. Cancer doesn't give two fucks about whether or not you put sugar in your coffee. 

As if I wasn't going through enough having people criticize my eating habits is just grinding my gears. 

It's so annoying how as soon as someone gets cancer everyone is a doctor/naturopath and is telling you about their wonky cures. 

The same woman telling me to eat vegan gum also recommended ingesting distills of kerosene and turpentine to my mom as a cancer cure. The gall! The fucking nerve!

I had a horrendous open partial nephrectomy a week later and the recovery was awful. Sadly, though, the emotional aftermath was/is far worse. No one mentions that during diagnosis or before and after surgery. No one tells you that every sniffle brings a paralyzing fear. Every ache, every pain feels like being in a haunted house where something may be lurking behind the corner ready to jump out at you. That's the thing ""they"" don't tell you. Or at least no one told me. My mom still cries. My husband is basically walking around in that haunted house with me, gripped with fear every time I have to have a scan or mention not feeling well. What brings me to these thoughts, strong enough to make me write about it is that I have had a persistent headache for months now. Sometimes it's just a nagging type thing that I can brush off and ignore. Sometimes it is worse. 2 migraines in 2 months but hadn't had one in a decade previously. My memory has suddenly become iffy and I forgot which way to turn in an intersection recently (even though I have driven through it twice a day for 7 years).

Two years later, and we just celebrated him 75th birthday. He's happy, healthy, and full of life. The doctors are telling him he may have beaten stage IV lung cancer. There's been no evidence of growth on any of his scans in over a year now. He has two more infusions and then they are going to take him off treatment and monitor for growth. Fingers crossed, there won't be any, and he can live out the rest of his days in peace.

I’ve lurked here for a year or so- I’ve read and empathized with others, but I’m so tired of faking having a positive with everyone. Maybe someone here can understand. Apparently we aren’t aloud to be angry and pissed off. 

I was diagnosed with SCC a year and a half ago. I did Mitomycin C and Xeloda plus a horrid radiation treatment. Know what it cost me? Everything.

Know what I hate about having cancer more than anything else? The absolute financial ruin that decimated what’s left of your sanity and integrity. I literally hate it. 

A Middle Aged professional with a nice little apartment and just okay health insurance gets diagnosed with cancer. This after nearly a year of not feeling well and having to finally throw down with doctors to figure out what’s wrong with me. Almost all that time was spent waiting on referrals and then appointments which take forever. Once pathology had come back though, then you can get an appointment on a moments notice. 

I had three cats, a nice apartment, a decent savings and it’s all fucking gone. My life has been reduced to Raman, water and rationing eggs. That’s the face of cancer I see every day. 

I had to move from the east coast to rural Kansas because I couldn’t afford to live there any longer. Dropping two of your three cats off at the shelter because you can’t afford vet visits much less food was a real treat. I cried more over that than my diagnosis and treatment.

I’ve quit talking to family members and friends because I quite literally have nothing to say to them that isn’t an expletive. “How are you?” Oh I’m just fucking great. The radiation has left me with some pretty severe problems in my ass, want me to talk about it?

Or how about- I’m great - went to Walmart today and spent a good ten minutes debating between chicken and beef Raman and calculating tax. How was your day?

Im tired of the political bullshit surrounding healthcare. Who here thinks they should lose their home because they were unfortunate enough to get cancer? I don’t. I am so tired of it being a debate. Why is it a debate? Why is one person who has amazing insurance and a better financial situation - better than someone else who doesn’t?

I’m tired of checking the mail. I put it off as long as possible. God knows what disaster lurks within the mailbox. It’s nothing but anxiety. Oh hey it’s your insurance provider with more good news! We covered nothing of this procedure. Enjoy! 

I’ve pretty much given up dealing with specialists. 100 miles round trip isn’t just a lesson in stupidity, it’s not able to be maintained.

I feel defeated and that makes me angry. Being told it’ll be fine or it’ll get better makes me angry. Feeling impoverished makes me angry. Feeling tired all of the time makes me angry. I’m just angry and can’t stand it.

Screw the upcoming holidays. Everyone is gathering in Connecticut- too far and too much of a drive not to mention all of the other considerations. 

I’m angry and you know what? We are allowed to Be. I’m allowed to be angry. 

Cancer isn’t fun. There was no great eye opening life experience for me. I didn’t learn anything profound.

She had cancer when she was 25 before I was alive and beat it. When I was 8 she got breast cancer and they had to mangle her breasts to save her life. she beat it, and then it came back years later, they removed the breasts and she was cancer free again.

Then she got it in her lungs, it spread everywhere and made her body waste away for years and years, her dying was my biggest fear and I planned to kill myself as a little kid after she finally died, I couldn't imagine excepting her death, she was my only parent because my dad is dead too. I slept in the same bed as her until I was like 13.

As it got worse and worse, she persisted on doing anything possible to survive, I never thought in a million years I'd get to the point where I was wishing she would just die and stop fighting, it was very very clear she was going to die at any moment. Yet she told doctors to keep her **off** the ""do not resuscitate"" list. If her heart stopped, by law they would have to give cpr.

And then she persisted beyond the point of *inspiring*. The day before she died, she was telling me in a gravely choppy voice (She could only speak whilst inhaling) that my sister was giving up on her for telling her ""it's okay to let go, you are going to die"". 

It was an unspoken rule that we don't tell her she will die, the doctors have been saying otherwise for years. She went on to start shooting ideas on how to survive. I'm a late teenager at this point, it wasn't too long ago.

She believes in god so I told her ""if you do die, you are going to realize you had nothing to fear after all. This isn't the end of you, or anyone in the slightest bit. You will be at such peace, you might even look back think being scared of death was silly! We aren't going to be separated and we never will be,"" etc. Etc.

My moms reaction? ""Please get me some vitamin C I need to survive"". (The vitamin C/alternative treatment is a whole other thing, she got desperate.)

The next day, her body is shutting down and she can't speak, her eyes are wide open and all the doctors are telling us she is dying and needs to get taken to another room where she will pass. My sister and I are asking her if she knows what's happening, and she is *barely* able to nod for ""yes"" she looked so scared and cried almost every day for the last few months, up until her last day. The doctors pump her full of morphine and took her off oxygen. It all happened so suddenly.

As she lay there breathing her last, awful breaths, the nurse suddenly starts looking for more morphine, and then runs out of the room to get more (it wasn't dramatic, I'm sure only I noticed.) She quietly rushes back in and injects more morphine. I think my mom was showing signs of distress, I was very focused on the nurse. She Injected even more at a certain point. I was the only one who walked away and couldn't bare to watch.

When my mom was on her last 5 - 10 breaths or so, she fucking suddenly opens her eyes, and leans her head forward and looked around at the people standing around her, everyone yelled for me to come over so she could look at me, and let her see I was there. but I was on the other side of the room and didn't get back in time. I saw her though, she looked aware and scared. She looked like she couldn't breathe. it was horrific.


Throughout the **entire** time, my mom refused to die, was scared to die, and suffered the whole way through and I've never talked about it. There was no ""farewell, it's my time now"" shit. If I was to use a metaphor to describe it, she was ripped away by the ankles leaving nothing but claw mark's across the floor.",2020-07-18 12:00:16

In hindsight there were symptoms earlier, in July and August, but they passed and life went on. But for me, I awoke at about 7:15 on Oct 16 1980 and unable to move my legs and with a fever. We drove 90 miles to a regional hospital where a blood test turned into a bleeding event. In the end it turned out I had Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL).

Two years later I relapsed, two years after that I was done with ALL. Six years later was the Testicular Cancer from the treatments for ALL, but I made it through that too. 

Now not ever cancer goes in remission easy, not ever leukemia is going to work out that well, but sometimes it does, sometimes cancer gets beat for a long time.",2020-10-16 20:39:54

I've been spending every moment I could with her. She couldnt talk and wasnt really coherent for the last month or so. I spent all day with her yesterday with my chair pushed up to her bed. I had a nap with her, held her hand, kissed her, played some of her favorite songs and read her a book from my childhood. I told her she needed to go be with her father and that she didnt need to suffer any more. When I left I knew she was going to let go. I told her I love you over and over. Even though she couldn't talk she would make a noise every time I said it.

So I guess this is it. Having a 5.1cm mass now in the. Pleura but adjacent to the mediastinum as well as many other smaller growths they have downgraded me to “weeks”. It really is amazing because I feel fine. I have recovered well from a Hindquarter amputation/hemipelvectomy my latest scan shows the surgery caused hyper progression in the lungs. 

So my palliative surgery which did relieve my pain from the huge 20lb tumor ripping my leg to pieces has cut my life expectancy from months to weeks. The crazy part I really really feel fine, wouldn’t know anything was wrong if I didn’t have the CT which the surgeons didn’t want me to have.... just venting. I move to California to try and make it to MAID (medical aid in dying). 

My lung surgeon said she doesn’t thjnk anythjng is imminent but I can’t be operated on again while still recovering plus she thinks it would do more harm then good. I’m out of systemic options according to my medical onco, inoperable according to my surgeon and they won’t do any more SBRT according to my radiation onco. My performance status and prognosis prohibit me from most clinical trials. I truly have no more options to fight it.

If i can hang around a national organization may do a feature on me as I’ve lead quite the unique and interesting life. I may head to try and live a dream and do a little bit of awareness raising for sarcoma and MAID on my way out. Considering broadcasting my death with dignity live to raise maximum awareness about the condition. It at least let’s me feel like I have a purpose here at the end.

I am not doing anything special nor have ever really care about birthdays, but I'm thankful for many reasons to see this one. I'm thankful to have had a chance at participating in a trial this year that dramatically improved my case and to be alive to see another year go by even with all the heartache and pain I've endured and have had the past year to get to know all of you in this amazing community. Most importantly, I've seen and felt myself grow pretty damn strong. I only wish my grandmother was around to see my progress, the birthday gift I want most is a hug from her right now.

I posted here last month and received wonderful responses about my very dear friend, only in her early 30s with stage 4 cancer, terminal diagnosis. She was admitted to a hospice and was suffering from cachexia etc. She had chemo and immunotherapy and nothing was working. I seriously thought she was close to dying, as did family and the doctors.

WELL, in a turn of events. Her consultant had told her no more treatment as she was very ill after the immunotherapy and her scans showed progression. She told the doctor - try me on one more platinum chemo, for my kids! He was very reluctant and at this stage she had a syringe driver and was immobile. But he agreed. 

Slowly but surely she has started gaining weight. Her appetite is back with a bang! She even said this new chemo is causing barely any symptoms only nausea which goes way with the antisickness tablet. She was discharged from the hospice! She has been out walking every day and has been doing things with the kids, going to the play park and doing art etc. Heck she was even ironing and doing laundry the other day, unassisted!!!! She told me she can feel some of her tumours have actually shrunk (breasts and neck) and the pain is much less in certain areas to the point her syringe driver has been put down to the lowest amount. She is no longer sleeping all day and doesn't even need to nap. Her ""cancer clothes"" very small clothes are no longer fitting her. She is so much happier and optimistic now. This woman is the strongest and most tenacious person I know. I am so glad she is still here, for her kids and for us all.

Her syringe driver is due to be taken out next week and she will go back on an oral opiate for pain. But she has been taken off all the extra pain relief with her feeling better. 

It is like an actual miracle!!! She seen her consultant last week and he was amazed by her progress and joked that he was glad she forced him into doing one more chemo and that only 5% of people with her type of cancer respond to treatment. He booked her a scan so we are just waiting on the results of this. 

I just wanted to share this for anyone who is struggling just now to give a bit of optimism and inspiration. My husband a few months ago kept telling me to try and be open minded and positive about her, as I'd often be in a heap crying daily. I would get angry with him and say she has terminal cancer she isn't getting better. Well she has proved me wrong and my husband was right...for once haha.",2020-10-07 02:46:37

There aren't any more treatment options for him, so we're switching over to palliative care to relieve his headaches and nausea. Unfortunately he's mostly nonresponsive now and very confused and incoherent when he is awake. We have to keep him mildly sedated to keep him calm, because otherwise he starts trying to pull his IVs out and get out of bed (and he's a major fall risk). He probably won't be able to come back home because it won't be safe for him here and he needs 24/7 care considering his disorientation. The oncologist said she thinks he has a few weeks left, but not months.

I'm so sad. I miss him so much. I keep wanting to text him but I know he can't text back. Yesterday he was chatty but really confused. Today he doesn't give any sign of recognizing me or anyone else he knows. 

He was such a wonderful person before he got sick. Just outrageously funny, lively, active, stubborn, opinionated, talkative, brave, kind.

I am not an angry person, but find myself becoming enraged lately at two different types of posts.  The first, is the ""Is This Cancer?"" post by paranoid hypochondriacts or people who have not been to a doctor for even a preliminary finding.  How many times must we tell people we don't diagnose, to see a doctor if they're suspicious, & to obtain health insurance if possible, especially if they are worried about cancer?  Can we take a vote to ban these posts?  I want our sub to be inclusive, but seriously, this is getting old.  The second type of post is the ""Obvious Hoax Cures All Cancers"" post.  If lemons & baking soda cured cancer, do we really believe those of us who suffered through chemo, radiation, surgeries, transplants, etc... would have done so?  
I know we can somewhat control content with our upvotes & downvotes, but this is a small sub so even the zeroes show up.  Even seeing these posts are like a slap in the face to those of us suffering through REAL cancer & REAL treatment, be it us or a loved one.  This sub shouldn't be a home for science deniers or conspiracy theorists, we have r/conspiracy if you want to believe that big parma is interfering with cancer cures.

I watched her decline over the last few weeks, all that practice becoming observant to any changes during her chemo made it hard not to notice all the things that happen when things go south.....

Stage 4 adenocarcenoma, metastasis to the brain. Radiotherapy didn’t work. Chemo, immuno, smart, targeted, all of that... may have killed what was in her lungs but I guess once it crosses into the brain, not much else to do without collateral. 

My father, sister, aunt and girlfriend were there with us at the end. We were all talking and joking as I lay next to my mom, then I noticed she had not taken a breath, not in 20-30 seconds or so. I watched her, counting the seconds, got to 60 and I felt something break inside me. Turned to look at my sister and she knew....

My mom always liked to be in a room full of life around her, she hated being alone. I know she loved me and felt safe with me, and I know that my warmth and embrace comforted her. 

Why do I feel guilty when I drove away from her plot that I abandoned her? I know she isn’t in pain any more, and I can’t fix anything or make her comfortable anymore but I still FEEL like she needs me. 

I handled all the paperwork for the family, handled the hospital papers, morgue papers, burial arrangements etc like I was a damn robot. I felt numb going through it until the moment I drove away....... 

I know I’m rambling, I feel like this is the only place I can talk about this. I’m not ready to talk to my family yet, or my girlfriend yet. I just feel like letting go will be hard.

I flew to the Middle East for my mom, and I fear that flying back to my home half way around the world will sink me into a hole because I left her in the ground so damn far away.

When is she waking up? i miss her” she said this because when i used to live with them i always slept till noon and she would always anticipate the time i woke up to hangout with her. 

My mom is my life, my best friend, my home, my everything. I have never loved anyone in my life half as much as i love my mother. Shes only 56 and i am 20. I cant lose her this young. She was the reason why i got into uni. She deserves to witness my graduation. 

I am miserable. Cancer is the worst. You get to see your loved ones lose their energy and slowly decay before your eyes. 

I just know i will miss her advice, smell, hug, laugh, stupid jokes, and compassion. I will miss her head rubs when i had a bad day, and our intellectual conversations at 3am. I will miss every fiber of this human and it is killing me. How i wish it were me instead of her.",2020-06-12 09:55:10

As my stumbling got worse and worse, an MRI revealed a GBM IV in my spinal cord in the L5 region.  Emergency surgery ensued and 6 months of physical therapy later, I've been making head ways. Walking on my own (with a cane), hanging out with friends and all that good stuff. Also, I'm 31.

&#x200B;

Last week my ankle on my left side started feeling weak. I felt like something was up, but wasn't sure what. I just got the scans back from my MRI yesterday. The last scan was only 4 weeks ago, and it showed nothing. Yup, it's back. My worst nightmare. My mom and my wife cried, and I sat there simply asking about next steps. I just need a path I can work towards. I will hopefully be going on a clinical trial which has had positive effects on stabilizing and reducing the cancer. I'm positive, despite the bad news.

&#x200B;

But I wanted to do this...This is something I've been thinking about all day. I want to make a declaration. Something that I can look back to and know without a shadow of a doubt that I will use all my mental and physical strength to fight this.

&#x200B;

I hereby declare that I will fight this cancer until it no longer exists in my body. I will not let it impact the quality of my life. I will not let it define me, my character or my love. We all live on borrowed time, and the time I have from here on out will be the most special, the most epic, the most meaningful I have ever lived. I will not let this mutation be a menace. I will take it, deconstruct it and turn this into an experience from which I gather strength and wisdom. When I look back on this declaration, I will know what I already feel in my heart and mind. I am stronger than anything which afflicts me. I am a survivor. I will be like a cockroach that lives through the toughest of times, only to make it out on the other side, as if nothing happened. There's no turning my back on this. I have family that loves me, friends and colleagues that support me. I will do it for them. I also have 2 lovely cats, Manny and Butler. I will do it for them too. I will do it for this community too. Let's kick some ass!!",2019-05-02 05:35:30

322,What cancer feels like,119,fz0443,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/fz0443/what_cancer_feels_like/,32,1586622463.0,"I post this every few months, I think it sums things up perfectly. 

Written by hedgehog... 


What’s it like to go through cancer treatment? It’s something like this: one day, you’re minding your own business, you open the fridge to get some breakfast, and OH MY GOD THERE’S A MOUNTAIN LION IN YOUR FRIDGE.

Wait, what? How? Why is there a mountain lion in your fridge? NO TIME TO EXPLAIN. RUN! THE MOUNTAIN LION WILL KILL YOU! UNLESS YOU FIND SOMETHING EVEN MORE FEROCIOUS TO KILL IT FIRST!

So you take off running, and the mountain lion is right behind you. You know the only thing that can kill a mountain lion is a bear, and the only bear is on top of the mountain, so you better find that bear. You start running up the mountain in hopes of finding the bear. Your friends desperately want to help, but they are powerless against mountain lions, as mountain lions are godless killing machines. But they really want to help, so they’re cheering you on and bringing you paper cups of water and orange slices as you run up the mountain and yelling at the mountain lion - “GET LOST, MOUNTAIN LION, NO ONE LIKES YOU” - and you really appreciate the support, but the mountain lion is still coming.

Also, for some reason, there’s someone in the crowd who’s yelling “that’s not really a mountain lion, it’s a puma” and another person yelling “I read that mountain lions are allergic to kale, have you tried rubbing kale on it?”

As you’re running up the mountain, you see other people fleeing their own mountain lions. Some of the mountain lions seem comparatively wimpy - they’re half grown and only have three legs or whatever, and you think to yourself - why couldn’t I have gotten one of those mountain lions? But then you look over at the people who are fleeing mountain lions the size of a monster truck with huge prehistoric saber fangs, and you feel like an asshole for even thinking that - and besides, who in their right mind would want to fight a mountain lion, even a three-legged one?

Finally, the person closest to you, whose job it is to take care of you - maybe a parent or sibling or best friend or, in my case, my husband - comes barging out of the woods and jumps on the mountain lion, whaling on it and screaming “GODDAMMIT MOUNTAIN LION, STOP TRYING TO EAT MY WIFE,” and the mountain lion punches your husband right in the face. Now your husband (or whatever) is rolling around on the ground clutching his nose, and he’s bought you some time, but you still need to get to the top of the mountain.

Eventually you reach the top, finally, and the bear is there. Waiting. For both of you. You rush right up to the bear, and the bear rushes the mountain lion, but the bear has to go through you to get to the mountain lion, and in doing so, the bear TOTALLY KICKS YOUR ASS, but not before it also punches your husband in the face. And your husband is now staggering around with a black eye and bloody nose, and saying “can I get some help, I’ve been punched in the face by two apex predators and I think my nose is broken,” and all you can say is “I’M KIND OF BUSY IN CASE YOU HADN’T NOTICED I’M FIGHTING A MOUNTAIN LION.”

Then, IF YOU ARE LUCKY, the bear leaps on the mountain lion and they are locked in epic battle until finally the two of them roll off a cliff edge together, and the mountain lion is dead.

Maybe. You’re not sure - it fell off the cliff, but mountain lions are crafty. It could come back at any moment.

And all your friends come running up to you and say “that was amazing! You’re so brave, we’re so proud of you! You didn’t die! That must be a huge relief!”
Meanwhile, you blew out both your knees, you’re having an asthma attack, you twisted your ankle, and also you have been mauled by a bear. And everyone says “boy, you must be excited to walk down the mountain!” And all you can think as you stagger to your feet is “fuck this mountain, I never wanted to climb it in the first place.”",2020-04-11 16:27:43

She was battling stage 4 ovarian cancer for a little over a year.  I flew home February 14th to be with her when a few days later she was told there was nothing more that could be done and was put on hospice in her home.  She went through about 6 months of chemo in which she was platinum resistant, a hysterectomy, another few months of a secondary chemo, a pigtail drain, and finally a gastric drain.  

My sister, aunt, and I cared for her for the past two weeks throughout her hospice.  Yesterday at 8:31 am, she took her last breath and went to be with our Lord and her late father.  Watching my mom actively die was the most soul crushing thing I’ve ever experienced.  She’s no longer in pain now.  Her viewing and service is being held today and then she will be cremated.   I wrote a letter to my mom that I will be sharing at her service and I pray for the strength to be able to get the words out without breaking down.  Knowing I will not have her by my side for the rest of my life or my daughters life feels so selfish, but it is a real feeling I cannot dismiss.  I feel cheated, while at the same time I know she is no longer in pain.  

I will miss her with every inch of my heart, body, and soul.  I know time will heal my heart, but it’s so hard right now.   She was an amazingly patient woman who taught me to be strong willed, creative, and adventurous.  I love you my beautiful mom, forever.   ",2019-03-10 00:28:22

I was sitting next to him. His head was on my shoulder. One second he was sleeping, the next he was just\- gone. It's been 7 weeks. 7 incredibly long, miserable, horrible weeks. To say I'm not handling it well is an understatement, which I guess is what brought me here. My brother always liked reddit. Said it would made him laugh, or forget about problems. I don't know, I always thought people online were mostly jackasses (no offense to any here) but I guess my brother just always brought out the best in people. He could find the good in everyone, find the joke in anything, zero in on the people he could horse around with and make everything a party. He always had his sense of humor. His reddit name was photonstravellight, if anyone here knew him. I never even had to make my own account, my brother would cherry\-pick the best stuff almost every day and send it to me. Made for a lot of laughs. Gonna have to do that myself now, I guess. Even had to go and make my own reddit account for the very first time, which just seemed surreal. I'm sad, and upset, and angry, and I alternate between wanting to break things and wanting to just sit in the corner and rock myself. My brother didn't deserve this. I'm the asshole, it should have been me. My brother had a future. He was a brilliant physicist. He played a mean fiddle. He was kind, and thoughtful, humble, and genuinely cared about everyone he came in contact with. He was the best person I know. I would gladly take his place. It should have been me. I did 3 tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, I should have been the one to die. Not him. He was by far a better person than I will ever be. At his very core he was a good person. Seeing him struggle through brutal treatments for 2 years and not be able to do a damn thing was a nightmare, but I thought it was a means to an end. I always thought someway, somehow, he would succeed just on sheer stubbornness. And even worse has been to see most of our mutual friends seem like they barely care. They mostly abandoned him when he was diagnosed (including his girlfriend at the time), the very few that stuck around seemed to give up on him in his final few months and mostly stopped talking to him. Then they all pretended like they suddenly cared when he died. And then just carried on with their lives the very next day, like absolutely nothing happened. Like he was just a speed bump in their lives. I always took for granted that having an identical twin meant I'd have a friend, a shoulder to cry on, someone to have my back, someone to play pranks on, (potential organ donor?)\- for my whole life. Now I have to face the next 40\+ years without him. There is not a day that I will not miss him. We were halfway through a bucket list goal of visiting every national park together. I have an unused plane ticket I bought him when we were supposed to go snowboarding last February and I had to cancel because of work. Wish now that I’d told work to kiss my ass and gone anyway. He was supposed to be my best man at my wedding next year. Not in a million years did I think the day would come that I would lose him. His funeral is this weekend, which just promises to reopen all the wounds that haven’t yet closed up. I don’t possess the coping skills for this. ",2018-06-07 09:40:08

He was diagnosed in late August with stage 4 prostate cancer. It spread to his bones, lungs, basically everywhere.

Watching my dad go through this was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. He was taken to the hospital in extreme unbearable pain on 3 different occasions. On the fourth and final occasion, he developed a bad bacterial infection and later developed pneumonia, which is how he died. The pneumonia spread to one lung, then I watched him die in the hospital each day as it spread to the other.

For anyone who might be going through the same thing, read online about the signs that someone is dying. He was really starting to fall apart mentally, he would start showing signs of his memory fading and eventually he was hallucinating and seeing things. Luckily they weren’t angry or aggressive hallucinations, but watching him continue to fade away was really hard. I’m not sure I’m in a state where I’m fully processing what happened, really seems like more of this numb feeling of relief that it’s over, and he doesn’t have to be in pain anymore.

Cancer took away my dad, mainly because he never went to the doctor for a check up or physical. He just never went, despite showing plenty of warning signs.

If I could go back and do it all over again, I think I’d try harder to get him to go to the doctor. Unfortunately he was stubborn and just was always going to do things his way.

I hope nobody reading this has to watch a loved one go through this battle. It changes you. I can’t believe he’s gone, but again, I’m just so glad that he isn’t fighting an unwinnable battle anymore. Fuck cancer.",2020-11-04 03:41:25

She’s been on intensive chemo since then which nearly killed her but it worked. All MRI scans have been clear so far and now the next step is 6 weeks of focal radiation therapy to make sure any remaining cancer cells go back to hell.  

I feel like I should be relieved, or jumping for joy that this chapter is coming to a close but I’m terrified. Chemo was horrible in every way but it was like a security blanket - I didn’t worry so much about her cancer coming back because the treatment was so aggressive I knew the chances of recurrence were slim. Now that it’s ended I’m shitting myself. What if the next MRI shows a new tumour and we have to go through this all over again? She’s only 4. This has been the worst year of our lives and I don’t know if I’m strong enough to do it all again. 

Idk where I’m going with this. I was expecting to feel so happy when chemo finished but I feel hollow, empty and scared. We’re entering uncharted territory now and I don’t really know how to feel. 

Just felt like shouting into the void. Thanks for reading 🙏",2019-09-28 19:35:00

As many of you know, my wife died of cancer a few weeks ago.

I've shared with you our journey (the good, the bad, and the ugly) almost from the beginning and specially during the last few months of her life, which were very difficult and painful to us both, and we needed a lot of support.

These past few weeks have been an intense emotional, physical, and mental commotion for me. I had to withhold most of my feelings during the two years I was her caretaker, and now the sadness, fear, anger, and pain are coming to me like a force of nature. Luckily, my friends and her friends are carrying me through this, like the true community of love she built for me and for them. Most days I think I won't survive this, but now and then I feel a bit of hope.

Last Saturday we got together and celebrated her life. This is something she asked us to do before dying and I've tried to honor all her wishes as much as I can, even if I'm tired or struggling with her absence. It was a beautiful moment. We built a mandala together using flowers, seeds and beans, and spices. We sang, we danced, we cried, we hugged, we laughed. It was a healing experience.

It had started in my pelvis but a few spots were present in my spine and ribs. At the beginning I don't think it looked that good. They immediately put me on high dosage chemotherapy which has NOT been fun. I've spent a lot of time in hospital as an inpatient because I get my chemo for five days in a row every three weeks. Neutropenia has been a BITCH and I keep ending back in hospital with infections too. However the side effects of the chemo aren't too bad in comparison to what others have, and the excrutiating pains I was getting before I was diagnosed in my ribs, back and pelvis  are non existent now since chemo has started. As well as that, one of my eyes started going partially blind due to a nerve being pressed on by a tumor.somewhere. Within four days of starting chemotherapy it was completely back to normal.


I had my first lot of scans done since diagnosis and yesterday I found out the results. The doctors are so so happy with how it's going. After just 3 months of chemo my primary tumor has shrunk from 5.5cm to 2cm!! And it's shrinking everywhere all over my body, with bits of it gone completely. They tell me they're going to do another 3 months of chemo, followed by 5 weeks of radiation in the pelvis... All going well it will all be gone. If it isn't, they said they will do some additional chemotherapy. They also told me they were no longer considering surgery since it doesn't seem needed.

It's not me that is going through the cancer but my stepfather. He might not be my biological father but he has been in my life for as long as I can remember and he has probably been one of the most positive influences in my life.

In February of this year he was diagnosed with an operable bowel cancer (no symptoms, just went in because a friend had bowel cancer). 3 days later he was in surgery and it was removed (quick shout out to the medical staff at St Vincent's Hospital) and was given a scan to verify it hadn't progressed. 5 days later he was informed it had metastased to his liver and he had 2 months with no chemo or up to 12 with. Fast forward to 16 days ago when the doctors gave him 2-14 days and I rushed home from my holiday in Europe.

My dads wish was to pass away at home so for the last 8 days I have been feeding him, administering medication, bathing him, and helping him relieve himself. For the last 48 hours he has been unable to speak or awake unless I move him to change his nappy.

My post isn't to highlight how fucking horrible this disease is but rather to vent about how he wasn't given the legal option to take his own life at a time of his choosing with the level of dignity we would all like. It has been consistent medication, confusion, embarrassment, and humiliation for him and I do not understand what we as a society are afraid of when it comes to death.

I will be calling and writing to my local member of parliament to remind them of the impact their decisions have on ordinary families and encourage him to push this agenda.

My most genuine and sincere apologies to anyone who reads this and it brings up negative emotions as that is the last thing I want to do.

For those of you with cancer or supporting someone with cancer, please keep up the good fight and as always FUCK CANCER! ",2018-10-21 16:33:09

My wonderful husband and best friend of 42 years died recently.    

He lost a kidney to kidney cancer in 2013.  

Shortly after that it was noticed that his PSA level was elevated and he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.     Bicalutamide, radiation treatments and Lupron shots followed and his PSA was reduced to zero (well, <0.01, as close to zeros as is possible).  We were so happy.  

In 2015 the prostate cancer returned and he started again on the bicalutamide and Lupron shots but it couldn’t be stopped.  

The cancer metastasised into his spine and the bones of his neck, the latter affecting his swallowing.  

He died 38 days ago, in my arms, in his sleep, at home.  He was pain free throughout it all - not through pain management, he was never in any pain.

She was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer in April and had a total laryngectomy in May. Then she did 6 weeks of chemo and radiation which resulted in clear scans as of September. Her PET scan done the week of Thanksgiving showed evidence of metastatic cancer nodules in her lungs. She was still waiting on the answer if she could be an immunotherapy candidate (she was too weak for chemo, radiation, and surgery) but her health rapidly declined before she had an answer. We found her barely able to breathe last Sunday and she was admitted to the hospital. On Christmas day she decided to go onto hospice. She was with us for a few more days (even though she wasn't really conscious) before she passed peacefully in the early hours of yesterday morning. We spent almost every minute with her, for which I am grateful. 

I'm still processing this. It makes me relieved that she's no longer suffering, but I also feel so many other emotions. She was on this Earth for 58 years and thankfully only this sick for several months.  While this situation sucks, she fought hard. 

She was a compassionate person, a dog lover, a TV aficionado (especially crime shows like ncis), an enjoyer of all foods (except cauliflower), and the best mother I could have asked for. Her sense of humor could always have the most serious of people laughing. She was a Philadelphia Eagles fan her entire life and I am 100% certain she had something to do with that crazy win last night. 

I will always love you, mom.

I was able to get through my first week of surgical residency (intern year) before having to go home. 

He went into severe hypovolemic and septic shock. It was fast, on the night he was admitted to the ICU he was up talking and I spoke with him at 11:00 PM. His last words to me were “I love you babygirl, don’t worry about me and have a great day at work tomorrow”. Less than 24 hours later he was intubated, maxed out on four pressors, on CRRT (continuous dialysis), was hypothermic and in shock liver. I asked for a sign from my dad that he was ready to go and a couple minutes later he started bleeding from his central line site. I asked the palliative care doctor, who confirmed he’d gone into DIC - essentially his blood stopped clotting. I’d had a patient of my own go into DIC and it was extremely traumatic for providers and family. I knew it was his time. 

My dad was the greatest man in the world. He was loved by every single person that met him. He was a lover of a well mixed Canadian club cocktail, his Weber grill, his tritoon and cleaning the countertops. He was the most organized and responsible person I’ve ever known and it led him down the path to great prosperity and happiness. I made several promises to him on Thursday - that I’d take care of my mom, always keep my house clean and treat every single one of my patients in his honor. 

We are devastated, and shocked by his absence. I posted here about a month ago and got great support so I want to thank you all for that.

355,Love and Leukemia,114,drp6bn,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/drp6bn/love_and_leukemia/,15,1572934407.0,"This isn’t a story about being sick, this is a story about being in love. I don’t think anyone believes when they are swiping right and left on Tinder in their late 20s/early 30s, “let me make sure to pick a partner who will stick by me when I get leukemia.” But maybe that’s what we should all think about when we pick a partner. It’s easy to fall in love when everything is sunshine and roses — healthy, financially secure, attractive and secure, able to control all bodily functions and untethered to an IV pole. 

When I met my husband we had a traditional dinner date. We talked for hours and we both quickly knew “this is it”. On our second date he told me he believed we were together in a past life. I thought he was a little out there but I found it sweet, endearing and sincere. As our relationship progressed I knew this guy loved me more than anything in this life. I didn’t know he would be the perfect partner to me during a cancer diagnosis and treatment but I knew he was it. He was that guy. He would love me no matter what happened. If I got fat, if I said something uncouth as I often do, if I spent my morning hungover and puking — I knew he would love me no matter what. I loved him the same, I felt it in my soul, an innate certainty. The cliche phrase “when you know you know”, it was true. 

Getting the leukemia diagnosis was a shock, to say the least about the most. We barely had time to discuss it when I was rushed into treatment. He immediately became everything — my caretaker, nurse, chauffeur, pharmacist, cook, cleaner, everything. Every duty I previously had in our household immediately became his responsibility. He refused to let me spend a single night in the hospital without him by my side. He slept on that awful hospital futon for 21 nights straight and many more after that. His devotion to me was and continues to be unfaltering. He would meet other spouses and caregivers in the hospital pantry room and they would be exhausted, exasperated, depressed. He told me that would confess to him their frustrations, sadness, self-pity. He would come back to my hospital room furious — how dare these people have an ounce of self-pity when their spouse or loved one was the one suffering and fighting for their lives. None of this came as a shock to me, I knew who I married but at the same time, you never *really* know. 

Friends and loved ones who witnessed my treatment, hospitalizations, bone marrow transplant and subsequent complications also bore witness to my husband's love, support and devotion. This has been the greatest gift, the only brightspot in this shitbag, nightmare diagnosis that has overtaken my life. Everyone, including my mom, who had a little hesitancy about him in the past now sees what I see. Knows what I know. I still can’t speak of it without crying because the overwhelming love and gratitude is so intense. 

I guess I wanted to write this because, for anyone still looking for love, and looking for a partner, you should look at them and make sure they will stick by you “in sickness and in health”. It is an easy phrase to repeat. It is easy to let it pass through one ear and out the other but extremely difficult when it punches you in the gut. Pick a partner who will love you even if you can’t have sex with them for 15 months. Pick a partner who you will still love you if they see you at your absolute worst, and vice versa. Pick a partner who will love you through leukemia.",2019-11-05 06:13:27

It might’ve been a “had to be there” moment.

&#x200B;

At any rate, he was so clever and quick, smart as a whip, fast-talking and sometimes depressed. He would ask if he was messed up because he sometimes had darker thoughts. I would hug him and remind him how amazing and special he was. Not just to me, either, but to everyone that met him. We played D&D, and he was a video game nerd. His friends told me he had a special talent for finding the best games. He knew a lot about weaponry and owned a few swords. He had a few collectibles, too. Never opened them. He liked to preserve things. He’s an incredibly gentle soul.

Fast forward to yesterday. They (Northwestern) reviewed the pathology. And the CT. Final treatment plan? No additional surgery, no radiation, no chemo. I'm in remission. Woohoo! I have an MRI and a CT scheduled for Sept 1 to recheck my arm and to keep an eye on the nodules in my lungs, but they're not worried at the moment.

362,Job Let Me Go,111,jcfrh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/jcfrh9/job_let_me_go/,37,1602903017.0,"I started a new job in June, small company but everyone there seemed team-oriented and I loved it. It was primarily office-related duties that helped the higher-ups free up time for important things; answering phones and filing, that sort of thing. 

A month into my work I find out I have breast cancer. Stage 1C. Sadly this wasn’t my first go-round with cancer and I’ve been let go from jobs due to missing work for surgery/recovery/treatments so I went in to HR and very directly explained my situation. I told them I loved my position but that I understand they have an office to run and if they needed to let me go they can just tell me now.  An hour later I have a conference call with my immediate supervisor and she tells me that my position will be there when I’m recovered, that I’m a “gem” and even pack up a monitor and my desk phone to socially distance / WFH pre-surgery. I was so relieved and happy. 

Double mastectomy, 6 weeks go by and I start feeling better. I send a few messages but no one responds to my emails. I try texting. Nothing. I get ahold of HR again and she says “That’s strange...let me get back to you.”  

The next day, I get an email from HR that basically says they’ve decided to go in a different directions and sorry, you’re done. I was flummoxed.  Really, that’s how they tell me?

Then today, two days later, I get a nasty email from her saying they need their equipment back.   I said I can get it to her one day next week. I also asked for a receipt of return. She gets super snippy and says she’ll leave one with receptionist. 

My thing is...you’ve just let me go during a pandemic with no notice and I’m recovering from breast cancer, but your biggest priority is Avaya phone and dinky monitor?  What is wrong with people???  I wish they’d let me go when I told them because this is the kind of hurt that breaks you down mentally. 

I just needed to vent. Thank you for reading.",2020-10-17 02:50:17
363,My cancer is back,115,j9irkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/j9irkw/my_cancer_is_back/,35,1602499153.0,"I was cancer free for over a year. Now it’s back. I don’t even know what to think. I feel numb.


Update:
So I posted this about exactly a week ago. Since then a number of things have happened.

My original cancer was a freaky, super rare type of sinus cancer, with metastasis to lymph nodes on my neck. I underwent a massive round of surgeries last year, as well as radiation and chemo. Since then quarterly checkups have shown no signs of it still being there.

This summer I noticed the tiniest red bump on my shoulder/back. Like a mosquito bite, and that was what I thought it was for a long time. But it never went away, it was itchy and I had a history of cancer.

I showed it to three different doctors, including my ENT, who all said this was nothing to worry about, but they removed it and sent it to histology just in case. And guess what, it was cancerous... That was the bleak message I got on Sunday/Monday a week ago.

So this Wednesday I got a call from the hospital, where they had already set up both a «scanning day» and surgery for me. Thursday I did several scans and had physical checks by plastic surgeons. Friday I had surgery where they removed a huge chunk of skin around the bump that I had already removed, all the way down to the muscle as it went deep. They also took out a lymph node from under my arm. They are going to check it for metastasis, and I will be notified in a couple of weeks. If it is cancerous I’ll need further treatments and more surgery.

The thing is, they say this is a new type of cancer, not even related to my first! Apparently it’s an atypical malign melanoma, with cancer cells that are hard to define(?)

So I’m sitting here like... I’m not even out of my 30’s, and I’m getting two (atypical) cancers in two years? What the hell is going on?

I do feel completely defeated at the moment. Last year I had the will to fight, and I fought it. I’m somewhat traumatized by the experience, but I fought it even though I knew my odds were low. This time it feels different. I’ve struggled with PTSD and depression since last time, as well as other aspects in life have hit me pretty hard. It’s like I don’t even care what happens to my body, or if I even survive. Even if this time my odds are a lot better, it just feels like I have less to fight for.

I guess I’m still in shock, and shouldn’t be so hard on myself. Hoping it gets better. Heavy painkillers are probably messing with my mind as well.

Also, thank you for all your support! It means the world!",2020-10-12 10:39:13

Still, I wanted to share that I’ve been doing so well. I was able to graduate and land a position at my favorite museum (I’m going to brag and say that it’s a prestigious museum, hehe). I studied anthropology in case anyone was wondering!

I haven’t posted since my diagnosis, but I want to let you know that I would read all of your posts religiously, and I cried with you, empathized with you, and celebrated with you. 

So even though I haven’t been super active, I feel close enough to you all that I want to share some other news that’s made me really happy. My initial CEA(tumor marker) levels were at 4000; they have gone down to 26! I know that they’re still high, but it still feels like an accomplishment :)

37m stage IV colon cancer. Colon tumor removed, but ~11 mets on the liver. 9 rounds of FOLFOX + Vectibix so far. Before chemo the surgeon said he couldn't do anything about the liver mets because they were evenly distributed across the liver, but maybe if the chemo worked he could do something down the road.

Today I saw the surgeon (surgical oncologist) again. He looked at my most recent CT scan, and said my response to chemo was ""miraculous"" and I'm having as good of a response that we could hope for. The biggest spot is the size of a thumbnail, and many of the smaller spots are no longer visible. There's a few scar-like spots he can see.

He wants to do surgery to remove 1/3 of my liver, and also ablate (burn off) any abnormal spots or scar tissue on the remaining liver. He'll also remove my gall bladder because it's in the way. He wants to pause chemo until after I'm recovered from the surgery.

This is what I've been hoping for since the start. I'm a bit nervous about going into surgery again and the recovery. I'm excited to get a couple months off of chemo. If everything goes well, maybe I'll be done with cancer by the end of the year!",2020-07-21 03:33:49

Back in March my boyfriend was diagnosed with Stage 4 terminal colorectal and liver cancer with tumors that were in the 8-11mm range. He has since done 6 rounds of chemo (IV plus one week pills, one week off). 

His CEA numbers shot way up from 600 range at diagnosis to 3300 range and the doctors were concerned that they may have missed cancer somewhere else. They did another scan and thankfully he is clear everywhere else, his tumors have shrunk, and the CEA levels (as hoped) were due to cancer cells dying off. They also increased his chemo treatment because he was handling it so well.

He is no longer considered terminal as they now can operate due to the tumors shrinking away from the important arteries. Next up is two more rounds of chemo (just had his infusion for first of the two yesterday) and then planning for surgery.

I'm a 34 M who was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer in May of this year.  The cancer is in my left lung, but has moved to my lymph nodes in my chest. The largest tumor in my chest was a 3 by 4 inch tumor around a node.  Being so young and with very little symptoms, several doctors gave me anywhere from 1-2 years. Within one month I was coughing non stop, and breathing was becoming difficult. 

I have just completed 6 rounds of chemo and immune therapy, a drug called Keytruda over an 18 week period. CT Scans after only 4 rounds showed a decrease in all my tumors of at least 50% and in some cases the tumors were gone completely. The doctors called this a partial response, and were super happy.  My cough and breathing problems have gone as well. 

As it stands now I will continue treatments every 3 weeks for the next two years, if I make it that long. I've had almost no side effects from the chemo, or therapy except for a bit of flu like symptoms for a few days after each round. 

Anyway, my support group is very small so I just wanted to share my experience so far.  I'm not really sure how to feel at this point, I'm happy I am experiencing some relief, but I know it's not forever.",2019-10-18 17:09:13

&#x200B;

My 61 year old father died on a beautiful day in June.  I know that's cliché, but it really does seem jarring when the weather doesn’t line up with this crazy internal turmoil.  Didn't Mother Nature know my family's world was falling apart?

&#x200B;

Hospice gave my father 3 months to live, but ultimately, it only took 3 weeks.  It was breathtakingly fast.  The wonderful hospice nurse deftly read all the signs and let us know, more or less what kind of time we actually had.  I arrived the morning of his death to see a drastically different person.  He was gaunter than I had ever seen him.  The breathing was ragged and harsh.  His eyes wouldn't close or blink.  My heart turned to liquid and I drank it in my stomach.

&#x200B;

Throughout the day, I had an intimacy with my Dad I hadn't had for years.  I rubbed his feet, and felt the ridges and muscles under the skin.  I held his hands and noticed how wide and flat his finger nails were, that he had a healing cut on one of his fingers.  His smell.  The color of his eyes.  

&#x200B;

I read that the dying can likely hear during spells of semi-conciseness.  I talked about his grandchildren to him.  Talked about what was going on around him.  That we loved him and generally tried to keep it peaceful.  His anointing of the sick was really beautiful.  

&#x200B;

As the hour grew near, people came and went until it was just his wife, his sister, and me in the room.  My sisters from the coast were coming as fast as they could but wouldn't make it.  He took his last breath that looked like all the other breaths before it.  And then he was gone.

&#x200B;

My father contracted HPV16 in his younger years.  The virus worked on him and worked on him.  And then the chemo worked on him and worked on him.  And then the radiation worked on him and worked on him.  And then the tumors worked on him and worked on him.

&#x200B;

And you know what, there's a vaccine for all this now.  Gardasil inoculates against HPV 6, 11, 18, and you guessed it, 16.    It's mostly targeted for girls due to cervical cancer, but my Dad got head, neck and throat cancer, so please give it to your boys.  He didn't take the diagnosis with shame.  He and my step-mom leaned into it talking openly about it, and told everyone to get the vaccination.  It's not perfect and doesn't protect against all strains, but it gets at some of the worst ones.

&#x200B;

And now when I run into anti-vaxxers, I want to vomit.

&#x200B;

Take warning for us 20-30-40 somethings.  We can end deaths by HPV.  We can do it.  Only we can help prevent our grandchildren from having to bury their parents.",2019-06-19 10:34:50

As I prepare for the service Friday by getting photographs together, and trying to write something to honor her with, I cannot help but reflect on the past 2.5 years that she fought this disease. This is her abbreviated story. The full story was much more arduous.

She had finally found her perfect match. They got pregnant, but she miscarried, and went to get checked up. They found abnormalities and sent off for more testing.

My sister told me she had cervical cancer in February of 2017. I remember the shock I felt sitting at her kitchen table. I was numb. Our family has never been close to cancer. I cried. I toughened up and told her to fight it and beat it. 

She had a radical hysterectomy and a great gynecological oncologist reported clear margins. Great, now sometime to recover and heal. My wife told them that she would carry a baby for them if she wanted to. We thought there was light at the end of the tunnel.

About a month after her surgery, she had severe abdominal pain and pain in her right side pelvic area. The cancer had returned with a vengance. It had spread to some outlying pelvic areas but had not metastasized. Radiation and chemo we're next.

She went 5 rounds, but there was a severe pain that would not go away and the tumor was blocking her utera. They gave her a nefrostomy bag to relive the backing up of her kidneys but could not operate due to arteries and other delicate organs, and radiation was too risky. So they continued to try chemos. She went through a couple of trials.

2018 was a year of fighting. She battled the cancer through chemo and radiation. She changer her activity and diet. She searched for holistic and alternative medicines. Everytime I saw her she was working on something new. During this time she continued to raise her boys and keep her spirits up. She refused to give up.

We held a benefit to help with travel costs and she was so grateful and did as much as she could to help. But late last year they found the tumor had grown slightly so they ended her participation in the trial.

Her pain was always unbearable. They would try to find drug combinations to keep the pain down, but allow her to stay awake. She slept, and slept. She got weak, she stopped eating. Her last image was taken and the radiologist said there was something in her bowels. I don't know if it was cancer or a blockage, but she went from being able to talk and text, to nothing. 

She is gone. Our family is devastated. We have all banded together and will get through this. Her memory will live on in the stories I tell. Her legacy will live on in the children she leaves behind. 

My broken heart aches for my parents. My mother stopped everything to be her caregiver til the end. She will not leave my sister's house, and I can't blame her. My father spent countless hours at my sister's bedside. He would work tirelessly on her home projects she felt had to be done before she passed. 

She had a heart of gold and would help all strays (animals or humans) and a competitor's drive.  My twin boys adored her and she fought long enough to meet my third child in January.

I love you Sis. Til we see each other again.

I grew up in a good loving family, which I'm thankful for, but  growing up my life outside the house wasn't something I'd look forward to. I was the skinny kid in school, so I got bullied pretty much every year in school until I changed highschools. It once got so bad I stopped going out altogether for a good 3 years, my eyes would burn if I saw the sun, my peers were socialising and building their personalities, while I was becoming lonely, awkward, anorexic - but thanks to my family  never depressed - , everyday I go to sleep I'd dream of being fit, funny and talkative like when I was a kid, maybe even fall in love!

At 17, I had to change highschools due to course availablity, I met some of my primary school friends, who are really good people, and helped me build myself back up. Over the next few years started taking care of myself, trying to become socially adept, athletic, and all around a great person. There were some hard times in that journey, mainly at 20yo I lost almost all my college friends because of my scoial skills ( I had a feud with a girl in our group, and I handled the situation badly ). But hey, I stood up again , and this time I was actually becoming a functional person and a friend, last couple of years i made a best friend, few more good friends and socially things were perfect.

Meanwhile, I also was working towards my fitness, took a good 4 years to stop getting injured and get the diet right, but I finally did it, last year I was swimming 2 miles twice a week easily, was running track and my cardio was phenomenal, in the gym I increased my bench from 40kg to 90kg for reps. I even started getting some looks for the girls in college! I asked someone out, but as it was my first time I fucked it up.

So about February 2019, I start getting this pain in iliac crest, but only when contracting my abs/hip flexors, but since I was working out so much, I figured it was tendonitis ( I mean I'm a medical student, I can't be possibly wrong right?). The pain kept coming and going but every time it stayed a day longer, and my hip muscles started getting stiff and my butt muscles aching a bit, i started to think it was a bone related issue, but I'm a healthy 22 year old, with no history of cancer in the family.

4th of August 2019, I wake up with some mild butt pain ( back pain I thought, for sure ), that evening I go for a run despite  the pain, and as soon as I go back home, the pain goes from a 1/10 to 5/10, so I took antiinflammatory drugs and went to bed. Next morning I wake up with excruciating pain in my hip. I decide to take a radiography of my pelvis, just to check if anything is wrong with my hip bone, I do that and go check with a orthopaedic surgeon, he doubtly says it's more likely tendonitis.

Over the next 5 weeks, I sit on the pain, my front hip is becoming better and painless, while my right butt is alternating between pain, and cramp like feeling, it starts to mess up with my daily life. My doctor mom finally convince me to go take an MRI this Thursday.

I go into the MRI laying down - the most painful position for me -, I tough it out, the technician enters the room, tells we're doing another round, and gives me support for my legs fo the pain , now I'm thinking I probably just moved a lot and they're redoing it. Another 20m goes by, he comes back, but now with a contrast chemical, a nurse comes in and starts asking about my hip history,
""fuck this is bad"" I thought. I go out of the MRI, just to be told I need to do a CT scan.

Saturday, I go with my family to the clinic to get my results, I let my doctor parents take them while I watch formula 1 qualifying, I hear the nurse call my name, I  stand up and look for parents, my dad os holding the paper, shows it to my mom who turns her head in that "" this is the worst thing that could've happened "" manner"". That moment I knew. 

I'd like to finish by saying, I knew I was special, but not special enough to get a 3 per million bone cancer.",2019-09-22 19:45:25

I was diagnosed at 15 with Ewing’s sarcoma and over the past 7+ years, my cancer has come and gone a number of times. As far as treatments go, I’ve basically had it all (standard chemo, surgery, radiation,high dose chemo with an autologous stem cell transplant, clinical trials, kinase inhibitors, etc.) My relapsed Ewing’s sarcoma has been progressing. It was fairly slow at first but now it seems to be picking up speed. A few previously radiated areas (which had been thought to be dead or at least mostly dead) are coming back and new areas are appearing as well. I’ve been in this situation before, the only difference now is I’m running out of viable treatment options AND my bone marrow is so depleted from years of chemo and radiation that my counts don’t recover super quickly. Long story short, my oncologist told me yesterday I probably had 6 more months of “decent” quality of life. This news is extremely devastating, especially considering I’m just 2 semesters away from graduating college.

I’m currently on a regimen not frequently used in Ewing’s sarcoma (cyclophosphamide, vinorelbine, and Temsirolimus) since it’s arguably the most effective and least taxing/side effect-causing option I have left. Despite the spread of my tumors, there currently aren’t any “problem tumors” which pose a super immediate threat to my airway, heart, etc. Furthermore, aside from chemo side effects, I feel fairly normal and I’m not in a ton of pain, which makes the 6 month prognosis harder to fully wrap my head around.

I want to know other people’s experience being in the same situation. Did you or your loved one outlive your timeline? Or did death come quicker than expected? Was there anything that helped during this time? I’m just not sure how to live my life at this point since all the bigger bucket list things I want to do (most of which are travel related) are probably not doable with my current chemo regimen. Furthermore, I don’t know how to break this news to my friends and classmates. Telling people I have cancer is tough enough, I don’t even know how to approach telling them I have 6 months.

Any advice on the situation would be greatly appreciated. Thank you guys for your support and advice over the past years",2019-08-31 23:30:25

His surgeon was planning on removing 70% of his liver, letting it grow back, and then removing the remaining tumors. When he went in for surgery, they found that the tumors were too close to the veins. And if they cut those out, he would of died. So the surgery was cancelled. Next step, radiation. He did Y90, and had a really bad reaction. His body couldn’t handle it. They did another CEA scan, and his levels went from the 50s to the 200s. It went in an extreme downward spiral. His liver was failing. His oncologist gave him 3-6 months in December. On Sunday he called me to work on the cars, and on Monday at 2 am he texted me that he didn’t know how much longer he could hold on, and that he loved me. Now, there’s a nurse in the living room 24/7. He’s in his hospital bed, asleep, waking up ever so often confused and not making sense. He can’t really open his eyes. He’s swollen everywhere. And he really has one foot in this world, and the other in the next. I’m 21 years old, and I’m about to lose my best friend. I’m really scared and really overwhelmed and I’m just venting right now.

I wanted to share this with y'all - today is officially my last day of treatment for stage 3b colorectal cancer :) I am currently not showing any signs of the disease.

I still have a little ways to go before I'm all done (scans, getting my port removed, planning and implementing how to treat my new body to never have to meet this disease again, etc) but today is the day I get my 5fu pump removed from my port for the last time.

12 chemo treatments, 28 radiation treatments, 1 surgery, and a few complications later.

I'm beyond excited to stop living my life 2 weeks at a time!

It has been a hard road for me but I know it could have always been worse. For instance, I walked in and out of every treatment, which is more than I can say for some of the others at my treatment center. I choose to shave my head (for non-cancer, non-chemo reasons). I get to come home to my beautiful wife and loving dog every time. I now have the absolute best doctors (that listen and learn when they need to), nurses, and staff I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. 

Plus, I've had this sub and the related Discord! I've shared this resource with other patients and staff, as it's been instrumental for my psychological well-being. Thank you all :)

I won't ramble anymore! I'm just so happy. 

Please, if anyone has any questions, I'm open!",2020-10-23 20:13:58

April 17th a day that will live in victory. It will be my final treatment of chemo. I am half way done killing the possible tumor babies (I had a positive lymph node that had cancer, so my cancer metastasized, the tumor was 5 cm in size). Once I am finished and my port is removed I will instruct the nurse to throw the fucking artifact away, I will cut off my damn wrist band and throw it in the god damn trash, I will throw away my key chain cardboard cut out and my wallet insert that gives information about my port - I WANT NO FUCKING ARTIFACTS OF MY TREATMENT AT ALL!!!!! I will have a scar and a permanent ""sun tan"" on my chest along with a permanent ""tattoo"" on my wrist (a freckle)

&#x200B;

I will only have 25 sessions of radiation - and then I am fucking done with cancer treatments. It is just 5 years of a hormone estrogen blocking pill. Then it is ""occasional"" checkups. The ""big annoying stuff"" that steals my weekends are just about over!!!! Chemo taking 3 hours to get done, radiation 40 minutes at the hospital (procedure is supposedly 20 mins but for some reason I have to stay for 40 minutes 5 days a week for 5 weeks).

&#x200B;

I'm tired of fucking fighting, I want my normal life fucking back!! I fucking promise if this happens again, if I get a secondary cancer from treatment, or my original breast cancer returns - I AM FUCKING DONE!!!! I will not be doing this again.I'll ask my oncologist how much time I have left, if she says 2 years....I will say thank you I am going to smoke and drink and enjoy what time I have left, I refuse to get prodded and poked by doctors again!!! I am 32 years old, I don't wanna hear ""You are so young you have so much to live for blah blah blah"" - look I had my fill of life, I am tired of fighting every damn day not just cancer - but to fight at work just to provide for myself. My bucket list was short - I moved out of my parents house at 25 years old and I lost my virginity - I don't have anything else to want to ""try"". I am ready to go.  However I am not suicidal, but if death comes for me I will give him a big fucking hug!!!!!!

&#x200B;

I have grown very nihilistic - life is meaningless ""WORK WORK WORK WOOOOORK!!!! so you can buy shit, buy possessions, WORK FOR 40 more years....oh look now you die with your possessions that you can't take with you .... damn that was worth it. I promise you I will not be on my death bed thinking ""Man.....I wish I worked more and worked harder!!!!!!""

&#x200B;

I can't even enjoy beer or nicotine (via vaping) at this point, without lust what is the point of life? So please your guilt trip of ""I'm so young"" will not work on me.

&#x200B;

I don't want to hear ""Well you should be staying home because of CoRoNa!1!1!1!"" - bug off I am not giving up my daily routine, I refuse to be submissive to cancer or a little invisible ""bug"" if death comes for me so fucking being it!!!

It was a rough journey. A tumor on his hypopharynx. Radiation that destroyed the tumor but also, his esophagus. For a year he was tube fed. He loved food, his career was food. That was the worst part. It came back in his neck and was inoperable so he tried a T-Cell treatment until side effects landed him in hospital. Then one hospital stay led to hospice. The neck tumor grew to a horrific size. The bandages had special chemicals to neutralize the smell as it leaked and bled. It pressed on nerves in his neck and caused horrible pain.

 In the end it was the esophageal stricture that finished him. Unable to swallow he grew too weak to cough and his lungs filled with fluid until he just couldn’t breathe. His lungs sounded full of water. 

He had panicked earlier in the evening that he would suffocate, but in his final hours he was calm. At one point I walked into the room  alone and he said he loved me. And he told me he would be gone in 10 minutes. He said this wasn’t right. Not like this. I agreed that it was unfair. I told him I loved him and we’d get him some sleep. An hour or so later he died. He was right.

In the end we were there telling him how loved he was, that it was ok, we would be ok, his partner would be ok. That he wasn’t alone.

I looked up and all of the staff were there, standing vigil. A call light went for another room and one wiped her eyes and left.

Tomorrow morning the dr will come and sign his death certificate. Tomorrow is today. 

Now we just, keep living, I guess? The deep gurgle of his drowning is playing over and over in my head. 

I love you dad. Thank you for letting us be there to say goodbye.

He left behind the most beautiful sunset that I have ever and will ever have seen. I haven't had the courage to write about it until now because I'm positive that there are absolutely NO words to describe what I (and many others) have gone through the past few weeks. I've witnessed his last few, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds... I hear the rasping of his last breaths in my waking moments and dreams. I am eternally thankful that I was there to hold his hand until the end. I pray that he heard me tell him it is okay. That we (his family and I) are with him forever no matter where he goes. 

After he died, it was like a black comedy. His mother arrived and so did his younger brother, his two sisters in law, to talk to his still corpse. We all acted like it was okay (or as okay as it could be) and joked as much as we could while his body was still in the room (it took quite a while for someone ((the assigned nurse from hospice)) to pronounce him deceased). When the funeral people came, however, it was quite a different story. 

I was told by my fiance's older brother to not witness his body being lifted onto the stretcher and taken away because (bless these people) they would handle him as a body, as a job, which is not what I would have wanted to see at that time. So I listened and I spoke with the older brother's wife while I heard my finance's body being transferred and then carried out. I regret to his day that I didn't follow him but I'm not sure that I would have survived as I have if I had done so. 

His funeral services and reception were done that next Monday. His mother and father paid for everything with only the closest friends and family invited at the discretion of his family. His younger brother was responsible for the eulogy which had been cut down to 2 minutes during the formal ceremony and extended to 8 during the informal reception. We all smiled, laughed and cried in that order. 

Afterwards I moved from California to my hometown. My closest friends and family helped me pack and move my belongings in almost an entire day. I'm moving into an apartment within the next 7 days and I'll be reentering my previous job in the next 30 days. It's weird thinking that i'll be returning to how I was almost a year ago but without him. 

Every day I miss him. I miss the way he would slip from his work shoes into his sandals then head straight to the grill. The way he would sigh and then hug me close after a hard day at work. The way he would slip a hand around my shoulders and mutter something hilariously funny while he stoked the coals.

Even more, I miss the way that he would smile with his green-brown eyes and watch Jeopardy whenever it was on or force me to exit my social comfort zone to edge a little closer to his but, without that exuberance, I wouldn't have the support system I have now.

I am 32 years old, male, stage 2B invasive ductal carcinoma, non genetic - grade 2, ER+, HER2-

I had an inverted nipple for most of my life  (I would say atleast since mid teens, maybe since I was in early 20's I remember it a good portion of my life, just never put much focus on it )- thought it was normal and decided to get it checked out last year - I am ""happy"" I did, because it turned out to be cancer and it finally attacked a lymphnode.

November: 2019 - First Mammogram, ultrasound was done shortly after. They found a suspicious lump (not to me I've known about it for years just never got it checked out) - so they wanted to do a needle biopsy - which can be described as OW!!!!! (literally not enough novacane or whatever they use in the world to numb the area - felt like a wolf took a bite under my skin - they had to do it 3 times!!!)

&#x200B;

December 2nd, 2019 - get results - listed originally at the beginning of the post.  I get the call during work, busiest time of our year. I literally take the call while I am doing paperwork - once it dies down and I hang up the phone I tell my boss what I was told. Oddly enough I felt nothing, no grief, no anger just ""you got cancer"" It had the same inflection as ""the sky is blue"" or ""the sky is up"" .... yup sure is and water is wet. I was informed I should tell HR and did, I wasn't even aware what wild ride would happen over the next few months. I had no idea what was going to happen - I couldn't even comprehend it. I know surgery was mandatory, aside from that I knew nothing else. Sure watching TV shows you ""think"" you know, but shows like Breaking Bad are just over done for theatrics.

&#x200B;

Mid December - Followed by preop appointments, genetic testing, and physical therapy information. Along with meeting my surgeon and cancer team.

&#x200B;

January 9th - Mastectomy is finished followed by 2 weeks of recovery.

&#x200B;

February 13th - surgery for a chemo port is to be put in, followed by 4 sessions of chemo starting the next day. Dates are: Feb 14,  March 6th and 27th, April 17th

&#x200B;

May 11th - April 22nd - radiation Mon - Fri after work (feeling the affects now, chest is beat red, pealing, and burns when I move). Followed by an appointment with my radiation doctor right after my final appt. With oncologist as well telling me I need 5 years of temoxofin - with a surprise visit from my surgeon.....scheduling my port removal this weds.

&#x200B;

July 1st - MY CHEMO PORT IS REMOVED!!!

&#x200B;

July 8th - VACATION BEGINS THE MOMENT I CLOCK OUT OF WORK

Sept I see my oncologist again.

448,Looking for hope,102,gxligx,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/gxligx/looking_for_hope/,31,1591452062.0,"Hi all, 

I’m 15 years old, and i was diagnosed with osteosarcoma in May of 2019. I did 18 rounds of chemo, a limb salvage surgery on my right leg and was given the all clear in February. I recently found out I have relapsed after only three months in remission. 

My oncologist gave us another treatment plan which will involve 6 cycles of a different kind of chemotherapy and surgery to remove the nodules in my lungs.

This time around I feel really scared and discouraged. I can do treatment again, i’ve done it before but I understand this time that the prognosis is much poorer especially with how fast i relapsed. I had so many things planned for my life after treatment, i’ve been getting stronger in physical therapy and this just feels so unfair, i’m scared for what my future holds and i want to be a long term survivor so badly but I honestly feel cautious to be optimistic with the numbers my oncologist gave me. 

I’m not really sure why i’m posting this, i’ve never posted before but i think i’m just looking for reasons to keep going and stay positive from others in this community even when the odds are against me 

sending good luck and love to you all <3",2020-06-06 14:01:02

He was diagnosed with Stage 3 Pancreatic Cancer back in March, 2019. He had a whipple to remove most of it. He fought like hell. He was on the road to recovery and headed towards remission. The doctors declared that he would be cancer free by the end of his treatment. But out of nowhere, he got sicker and sicker. He lost over 90lbs. The cancer spread out of nowhere, and along with it, brought an internal infection that was anti-biotic resistant. There was nothing they could do. I’m just thankful that I got to drive down to SLC to say goodbye to him. I’m thankful that he was lucid enough for us to exchange our goodbyes. But watching him pass has been the most excruciating pain I’ve ever felt. For the longest time, we didn’t get along. My dad had the hardest time when I came out and married my husband. It was a long road of acceptance, but I’m happy that the last year, we finally got along as a father and son. The hardest words I’ve ever heard are “I’ll miss you son. I’m so proud of you.”  I guess my lesson here is to enjoy what moments you have. Sure, we didn’t get along my teen years, but I will always treasure the last year I had with him. Forgive the past, because people make mistakes. I love you dad, and I’ll miss you every day. So for anyone reading this, let go of the past and make room for forgiveness and kindness.

I’m currently in remission with about three years left until they can say I’m cancer free.

Anyways, cancer has given me nothing but grief. I’m now constantly worrying about my health, and any slight pain or sickness causes me to overreact and think it’s cancer. I’ve been having  random headaches behind my ear and I keep thinking it’s something bad, when in reality it isn’t. It’s also caused me anxiety, insecurity because people made fun of me, and now I physically cannot day the word cancer. It’s...It’s hard. 

I mean, I’m glad it happened to some degree, because I can share my story to inspire people and all that stuff. Life is gonna have its hardships, so why not look on the bright side...I just needed to vent because I feel silly talking to people in person about my health insecurities. Thanks for reading.

I really thought I was going to die in the hospital during that day. I was having fever hours after chemo and my blood pressure went down for the first time ever in my whole treatment experience. 
 
The next day, I had consistent shooting pain on and off from my left lung due to mets. I was screaming and crying from pain for 4 days and taking tramadol every 6 hrs. It had gotten me more depressed, scared and wishing I was better dead, asleep than enduring the pain and everything the chemo gives me. I laid on the bed for days, no appetite and told my Mom, ""Mom, I am ready to go. I think I just want to go than suffer, and make you all suffer."" It was around this time I have accepted that maybe, death isn't so tragic after all. Maybe sometimes it's the only way to ease or remove the suffering a person continuously feels. I have accepted that death is part of life, and I don't think I'll be afraid again if cancer permits me to go this way.

It had spread to his small intestines which led to a blockage, and a bypass surgery. Symptoms were apparent since December of 2017. He was not eating well and had abdominal pain once in a while. We thought it was just stress getting to him since his mother was ill. When his mother, my grandmother, passed away in Feb of 2018, he took a trip to ER due to abdominal pain. Again, we thought it was just part of grieving. Maybe, if we had taken him for a proper check-up. Maybe, if the doctor at ER had ordered a CT scan. Maybe, he might have had a chance. We could have had more time to prepare.


So for the last 6 months, he has had 2 rounds of the strongest chemotherapy which did more damage than good. After 5 rounds of the mildest chemotherapy, his body gave up. His bloodwork showed that chemo was working, but he just had no energy left in him. He spent most of his days sleeping, lost over 30 kgs, and couldn't handle the 30 min trip to the hospital anymore. 2 days ago, he got admitted to hospice because doctors don't see more than a couple months left. I promised him I would take him to Okanagan for stargazing and camping. I promised him a trip to Seattle to watch a baseball game. Everything he wanted, or I wanted, seems impossible now. For my graduation, my wedding, the birth of his grandchildren, and the rest of my mother's life, he will not be there. All I will be able to do is go to his memorial, put down flowers, and cry.

Thank you for all you have done for me. If we meet again as a family, I will make sure your happiness comes first before mine. Let's make sure we are even next time. It was great 23 years of knowing you. Your body may be gone, but I know that you will always be with me for the rest of my life and my mother's life. And don't worry about mom, you know she's a strong woman. I know how good of a husband you were to her. I will try my best to fill your empty space. And please say hi to grandmother. Tell her I am sorry I couldn't visit her more often and that I miss her so much. I know you missed her too. She might be pretty pissed that you found her too soon, but let her know my mother and I are gonna be fine. 


By the way, I'm going to a cemetery tomorrow to pick out a spot for you to rest. I hope you don't mind whatever I pick.

When I was 16yo, my little sister died (within 3 weeks from diagnosis) of cancer when she was 11. Six month later, my mother (38y) died also of cancer (within 3 months). A few years later, my uncle and grandma died of the same illness, too. After my sister and mom died, I had a genetic test done because university hospital lab technicians found it striking that two of my first-degree blood relatives died of this disease in such a short time. It turned out that I have a genetic defect in the tp-53 gene and that the risk of developing cancer is very high. Nobody seemed to be able to help me with that and there were no contact points for me either. I had the diagnosis and was on my own with it.

At first, every time I had pain anywhere, I had panic attacks, but it went better with every months passing by. I learned to live with the knowledge that one day I'd get cancer. It was never a question of IF, but of WHEN. I tried to prepare myself for the time when sh\*t would hit the fan and I thought I was doing okay. I gave my documents to every docter I went, but they knew nothing and everyone of them underestimated it. I had thoughts about family planning, I discussed it with my SO, but in the end I wasn't sure if I wanted kids. The risk of passing that genetic defect on to my children and watching them die was too much a risk for me. I didn't want to burden my SO with him watching his children die, it would be enough if he had to go through it with me one day.

As the years passed my hope of getting old (like my grandma, she was 76) grew. I felt safe and everything was just like a bad dream of the past. And then, 2019 happened. In April, I found a lump in my chest, and two weeks ago, I got diagnosed with breastcancer. I had a ton of examinations, from punches to bone scan to MRT and I still need some diagnoses because the doctors have a hunch that the cancer has spread into the lungs and the spine.

I realised that (almost) all my mental preparations where useless. I am so scared and I don't know what to do. I try to live a ""normal"" life as long as possible, but everything has a bitter aftertaste. Every morning I wake up feeling like I've ended up in a nightmare and the treatments haven't even started yet. I'm 34 years old and I don't know if I should dare to dream about my life after cancer. Why does life have to be so unfair?

I had a set back last week. Last Sunday night I woke up in the middle of the night and could not move my legs. At all. Quite paralyzed. 

I ended up in the hospital from Sunday night into Thursday afternoon. Fluid built up on my brain due to swelling. But, it took them forever to come to that conclusion. There was a chance that it was meningitis which scared everybody. So, I was locked down for a number of days while results, slowly, came back.

As it turns out swelling caused a build up of cerebral fluid which caused a few problems.
This whole episode has delayed chemo which needs to get started, but I need to be healthy ish first.

So this is where I am. Astrocytoma has turned to glioblastoma from which there is no cure. I would love to say I'm at peace. I would love to say this is easy. I would love to have more time. But, I'll take all I can.

Everyone around me is so psyched that I'm done with treatment but man I just don't feel that way at all. I'm not relieved. I'm still fucking terrified that this is going to come back and kill me sooner rather than later. My prognosis is pretty good but who cares about numbers when you're already an outlier having been diagnosed at age 35? I know there are a lot of folks on here facing much more serious diagnoses and I do feel shitty about complaining. I just can't shake the feeling that I'm not going to get to see my girls grow up.

I had surgery in November and did Radioactive Iodine early December.  I did my scan before Christmas and they found more Cancer in  some Lymph Nodes they left behind.  I had to have another surgery and that went wonky coming out of anesthesia.

Officially got the word that I'm all clear!!!!  No more surgeries and no more Iodine.  Because my Thyroid is completely gone now though I have to keep up with blood tests and that will help keep track of everything.  Man is that a huge weight off of my shoulders.

She had hepatic encephalopathy and I didn't know. None of her doctors knew that was happening. We were home back from a 2-month stay in the hospital. She wasn't sleeping at night but she was groggy most of the day. We couldn't hold a conversation. I had no idea what was happening. I was so desperate and confused. I drank some beers and got drunk, just next to our bed, where she was sleeping, and I still took care of her. Isn't that crazy? My sense of responsibility was such that I got drunk (mind you, with four beers) just next to her so I could make sure she was alright.

Three weeks later she died.

I'm packing our home today. Our home. I don't want to do this. I don't want to move out. I don't want to take down our wedding photos and pack her books. I don't want to leave this place. It's so unfair and so painful. This is OUR home. So yeah, I'm drinking again, like I did a several months ago.

489,One perspective on stopping treatment as a young person,98,ezm8og,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/ezm8og/one_perspective_on_stopping_treatment_as_a_young/,28,1580989442.0,"I just finished the final season of the Good Place. And I really recommend it as a funny, light-hearted show that's wholly cynical and yet at the same time so optimistic about humanity. I really recommend it for that reason alone, but the final season also made me feel more accepting of my fate. Of my death. Because I'm terminal, and I've been terminal for over a year, and for the first time in my life I feel like I can accept that. And I want to talk about my choice to stop treatment. 

I am a young person. I was diagnosed at 23 and I was diagnosed late, I was stage four when they found it and their optimistic guess was ten more years with treatment. I tried some treatment, chemo before surgery, and the sort of chemo that didn't make my hair fall out so life could continue on like it had with little disturbance. But the chemo didn't work and my cancer was aggressive. And my doctor said that there was no right answer, only the answer that is right for you. 

I chose not to do the harsh chemo because I didn't want to suffer before I died. The probability of it actually working (extremely low chance) played into it but honestly I saw it as two choices; dying by the ocean, or dying on the mountain. No wrong answer and either way you're still choosing death. But you get to decide how you die. And I knew I didn't want to suffer with my hair gone and unable to have the good life I so previously enjoyed. I knew I'd hate it. I didn't see the point. 

It's been a year since I made that choice. And truthfully its been a good year. A few ups and downs with symptoms but meds have sorted it and I still live largely as I did when I was completely healthy. I travel, I see people, I mostly play a lot of video games and read and spend time with my family. It is actually a lot like the Good Place in a lot of ways, no real responsibilities. Summer holidays 24/7. And I think that I have made the right choice for me. But I still have mixed feelings sometimes. Because... who can be content with dying? I think we're doing a disservice when the only dying people we see in movies are either the old, who are sad to go but peaceful with their long life lived well, and the young who die in a dramatic act of self-sacrifice in some kind of war. I think the reality is a lot more complicated. I'm not sure if accepting death is always realistic for young people facing the end.

If I wasn't hurting my family, I could find peace with leaving. But I am, so it's hard, and I do feel guilt for not doing the whole rage against the dying light thing. But at the same time, I know I'd hate it, and I enjoy my time now, and while I can't dismiss my fear of death and I know I'll be sad and scared when the time eventually comes, I do think I'm making the right choice to stretch my 'good time' for as long as possible. The illness touches as little as my life as possible. I get as much as my good life as I can grab. My point is that, if you are a person who chooses to stop treatment, you might not be wholly content with your fate. But you have two choices laid out in front of you and you think you know which one you'd prefer. To tell the truth, I do still um and err over my decision on some late nights. Because I don't want to die. I want to find a way to not die. But I don't think that's in the cards for me. So I made my choice, and I chose to die after living like I'm in the Good Place for a little bit. 

I don't want this post to make anyone feel like they shouldn't be doing something if that something is what they feel is right for them. But I would like to open up a little about my choice, because I rarely see it talked about, and I would like to let people know that I don't think anyone stops being afraid of dying.",2020-02-06 11:44:02

The cancer came back May 2017 in my abdominal lymph nodes. I had surgery then more chemo and radiation but it was unsuccessful. I found that out in February 2018. My doctor actually told me that I had 6 months or less to live, that I should go home and get ready. As a last Hail Mary they tested my tumor for a specific protein that immunotherapy could help. I was a GREAT candidate, so I decided to go on that route. I started on Keytruda (an immunotherapy) in April 2018 and have been on it ever since. My initial CT showed that 3 of 4 tumors were gone and that there was a mass but it hadn’t grown at all. My doctor told me he suspected that it wasn’t even live cancer tissue and that, although we’d need a PET scan to be sure, I may very well be in remission again. I found that out in December 2018 and it was truly a Christmas miracle.  

Well, I just had my PET scan last week and got the results today. There’s a new tumor in yet another abdominal lymph node that, while still small, seems to be growing despite the regular doses of Keytruda. My doctor said that there’s nothing to do at the moment. We’ll just have another scan in a couple of months and see. He also told me that we knew the treatment was working but it was never guaranteed for how long. He actually called the report “a mixed bag” because my prior tumors have all disappeared. But this new one is small, 1.8 cm x 1.1 cm. I don’t know how to feel really. I’m disappointed but I don’t want to let on that I’m scared. My fiancé and my family have all been really supportive through everything, and we all had finally gotten used to the good news that I wasn’t going to die any time soon. But now this.

I married my wife in October 2013.  We got together in early 2012.  I’ve known her since freshman high school. She is 32.  I am 31.  It’s unfortunate that we did not get together sooner.  In 2014-15 we notice she had urine issues and back pain and leg pain.  The doctors we were seeing thought it was just sciatica or kidney stones.  

In June of 2016 she goes into kidney failure. The doctors state something is very wrong and not normal. When he went in for surgery the urologist notice something “not normal” (cervical tumor pushing on her ureters) kidney stints get installed.  He gives us recommendations for an oncologists. We go and after the biopsy our worst fear became reality.  Stage 4 cervical cancer.  

3 months (I don’t remember how long) of radiation and taxol chemo goes on.  Doctor thinks this should take care of everything and get a check up after 3 months.  (Worst decision imho) we go in for check up and bad news and good news.  

The cervical tumor got smaller.  Bad news.  Something bad along the way and it went into lymph nodes in her neck and sternum.  Chemo continues on but with different kind of chemo( not taxol) and pretty much continues till Novemberish or so.  Each pet scan/ct scan was never great. Best case was tumor never got bigger or smaller.  Doctor said “in the medical world, that is a great sign.” And chemo should continue on.   Waiting on insurance to approve another round. 

(Chemo hasn’t started.)
After thanksgiving my wife starts throwing up and having serious nausea.  Zofran(spelling) is not helping. She can’t keep down her meds.  She gets admitted to the hospital.  They find out she has an obstruction in her colon( pretty much tumor is blocking things) 

She gets let out of the hospital after maybe 2 weeks.  She stays in my apartment. She’s doing fine for a couple days. She calls me up saying she has been having trouble breathing because so much vomit etc. I take her back to the hospital.  (This is either after christmas or not. But she did get to celebrate Christmas with us)

It’s confirmed she has pneumonia.  She is there for another couple weeks to make sure nothing goes bad. We are making preparations to see doctor for more pet scans.  It’s been almost 2 months of no chemo treatment due to being in and out of hospital.   Results show everything grew and now things have gone to her lungs and spine. Oncologist says no reason to continue.  She is now terminal.  Plans for hospice care is in the work. 

It’s January. Hospice care is going on. Somewhere along the way while she was in the hospital the doctor decides a gastrointestinal tube should be done.  To relieve her of nausea. Tho she is limited to liquids.  This was the best out of her 4 options given to her. And it became the best.  She has never had any nausea since.  

She has been staying at her parents house. Her parents are retired and have been taking great care of her. The hospice company has been great.  

A month ago we notice she can no longer stand/walk or move her legs. To go to the restroom.  We don’t know if this apart of atrophy or something related to cancer. Regardless we have to now fully take care of her.  We have to change her and clean her and do everything. 

A week ago. Hospice recommends 24 hour care. During this time her mental status has been so altered from the morphine it’s like she isn’t the same.  Last Friday starts where she is in respiratory distress. Having high rate of breathing and a huge drop in blood pressure. On call nurse stabilize her thru more meds to calm her and up get portable o2 thru nasal cannula to 5.  (Was 4 with a huge tube length- now shorter )

Now she’s been having Cheyen stokes breathing since Friday.  I overheard the nurse. Use the term “terminal breathing”

It’s very hard to see. She’s pretty much in a comatose state. No response at all.  

I’m lost for words.   Thank you for reading. Good luck to the rest of you all. Prayers all around.  And
Fuck cancer.

It was a tumor the size of a tangerine and at first it was keeping to itself, semi-contained. 

Last year it started growing, broke the barrier between the vagina and intestine and a colostomy was needed. She had a round of chemo + radiation and things were looking up, but instead of ‘melting’ the tumor just flattened and dried out, it was sort of dormant. As soon as the treatment was over it started growing again. 

In the last two months she started a ew therapy, but whatever they are trying the tumor is taking as sustenance and at this point is growing insanely fast. It went from the size of a tangerine to going up, pressing the kidneys, pushing her stomach and back.  Last week she was admitted to the hospital again and a nephrostomy on both kidneys was performed.

Cut to last night, when the doctors are officially giving up. She will be sent home soon, to spend her final days with her 20, 17 and 2 year old girls and husband. I will stay with her until she decides is time. I just hope it’s not too painful.

Surgery or death.,97,aavd1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/aavd1v/hard_surgical_choice_advise_needed_surgery_or/,43,1546200091.0,"I (29M)have locally advanced rectal cancer resulting from familial adenomatosis polyposis (FAP) and have had a 3 month course of Folfox and then radiotherapy for 6 weeks with more chemo. 

I recently went to my surgeons to discuss the surgery that will follow my treatments. I had assumed that my colon and rectum will be removed because of the FAP. However the surgeons have recommended that I have my prostate, my bladder, my colon, my rectum, the bottom five bones of my spine, and the muscle and bone on the inside of my pelvis on the right side. This is all because they can’t get a clearly delimited line between the tumor (at its largest, I have not had my final scans yet following radiotherapy) and my prostate and between the tumor and the pelvis. 

This would leave me in intensive care for 3 weeks follow surgery, having to be shifted from lying in my left or right side as to close the wound they create in the surgery they would have to steal muscle and skin from somewhere else on my ass. I would be unable to lie on my back, or sit and have to re learn how to walk (having read testimonials of people who had the same surgery it seems I will never walk properly again let alone gym. I used to be a pretty solid athlete before getting sick). 

I would also need a bag for urine ( I already have a ileostomy bag) and would be completely impotent for life and likely unable to climax either. 

If I don t get the surgery my doctor said I will likely get remission and die in three to five years. 

I do not want to die but also the life that would follow the surgery doesn’t seem like life. My life before was at least two hours of exercise a day. And also I don’t think I would expect my partner to stay with me if I can’t have any real sex life.

Biologically speaking, that is a fact. 

I will leave those specifics for the scientists and medical professionals to contemplate. 

To me, cancer is profound uncertainty. 

It is asking ""why us?"" over and over again. 

It's endless trips to the hospital and scrounging for toonies to feed the parking meter.

It's panic attacks while waiting for test results.

It's wondering if there will be a next Christmas. 

It's a crisis of faith. 

It’s being utterly powerless. 

It’s getting sick wiping up a chemo spill and wondering how he can tolerate multiple, full doses (straight to the heart) with such strength and poise. 

It’s trying to feed someone who can’t eat because food is the only medicine you know how to prepare and maybe the only language you have in common.

It's grieving too soon and then feeling guilty for your numbness. 

It's paperwork and planning for a future that seems so very small. 

It's your mother wondering how she can possibly live without her high school sweetheart.

It's not knowing what to say. 

It's feeling guilty because you're bad at knowing what to say. 

It’s asking your own dad which casket he prefers. 

It's disbelief. 

It’s laboured breathing.

It’s the shock and paralysis when you’re asked if you’d like to void a DNR. 

It's waiting for someone to come home who never will. 

It's going to ask someone a question who isn't there and then punishing yourself for your own forgetfulness. 

It's wondering if you've gone crazy. 

It's waking up and then remembering. 

It's feeling guilty when you try to forget.

It's having the memory of your father's face usurped by the image of some emaciated skeleton.

It's remembering two jaundiced eyes so yellow that you didn’t recognize them. 

It's the realization that those eyes didn’t recognize you.

It’s skin like tissue paper that you were too afraid to touch, hug, or kiss. 

It's a house filled with flowers and cards and people, but one that feels infinitely more empty. 

It's demanding answers and getting nothing back. 

It's being so angry and not knowing where to direct that anger.

510,My dad passed away tonight.,98,hs528i,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/hs528i/my_dad_passed_away_tonight/,27,1594912043.0," My outstanding 61 year old father had stage 4 colon cancer for two and a half years. It spread to his peritoneal lining which doctors kept telling us is harder to treat than if it were on a vital organ. We all kept positive throughout that time. My dad especially. He’s a tough as nails USMC vet who never complained, never gave up and always gave us so much love. Endless love. It doesn’t feel real. Me and my mom were lucky enough to be there with him and hold his hands, telling him how much we love him and that we’ll be okay without him. I kept crying on and off. He originally went to the ER yesterday for a bowel obstruction, uncontrollably committing the entire night and day. Then the palliative care doctor called me around 3 PM. It happened so fast. He had an oxygen mask on and wasn’t receiving fluids since it was filling up his lungs and his heart wasn’t responding well to it. I knew he hated the mask. I asked him to confirm if he wanted hospice care, he nodded his head. He knew it was the end. I did too. My mom was more in shock, in denial of it. As soon as they removed the oxygen mask and put an oxygen tube through his nose (cannula I think,) his breathing immediately shortened and shallowed. He couldn’t breathe on his own. They gave him morphine, so he wasn’t in any pain. The sweet nurse offered him a Coke, but he was too weak. The palliative care doctor was very kind to my family and my dad as well, which I’m so appreciative of. My mom held his hand the entire time while praying with him. Then my dad suddenly stopped breathing. I know people always say “it happened so fast,” but it’s taken me enduring this to realize it’s true. Time wasn’t real in the hospital. They were supposed to move him to an upper floor, but we stayed with him in the dark ER room. When I realized how quickly he stopped breathing, I panicked and ran outside to the nurse station just shouting that my dad stopped breathing. Three of them came inside and immediacy began doing CPR, and my mom started bawling. I’ve never ever seen my mom cry like that before. My sadness turned into shock, and I wrapped my arms around my mom to comfort her while she sobbed. She was staring the whole time as they were trying to revive him. I told her to look away if it was too hard. I was crying a little bit, but knew I needed to comfort her. I’m still shocked. I went through his cellphone and found old videos and pictures of me and him. They made me breakdown. It dawned on me that I’ll never get a text from him again. Never go to the grocery store with him again. Never get advice from him again. Never hear his dark, yet endearing marine humor again. It feels like I’m not living my own life. I’m going through the motions. I’m scared of the future. I’m 20 years old, barely about to begin college this fall. My brother is only 15. My boyfriend is also in the Marine Corp, and only got to meet my dad once last year. It’s all so confusing and I feel lost and broken. I know with time me and my family will be okay again. But a part of me has died with my dad. The only thing that gives me peace is knowing he wasn’t in pain when he went, and that he’s no longer suffering but whole again in the kingdom of heaven. If anyone out there is going through something similar, or if you’re blessed enough to have your loved one still alive and breathing, please be with them. Take pictures of them and with them. Take videos. Record their voice. Tell them you love them. Life can be cruel and short for some. I never thought I wouldn’t have my dad around at 20 years old. I’m his girl. He taught me so much and loved me so much and I’ll strive everyday to be the kind of person he’d be proud of. I’m sorry if this post is all over the place. My brain is hazy right now.

I've had a swollen lymph node before, so I wasn't too worried.  About a month after it appeared, it grew.  By the time my stubborn self went to the urgent care, it was the size of a softball.  The folks at the urgent care said they didnt think it was cancer, so they put me on a week long dosage of Prednisone and did some blood work before they passed me on to my primary care, who then passed me to Dr. Ranjit Joseph, the lead hematologist at UNC Rex cancer center.  He immediately began scheduling scans, xrays, and biopsies, and I was diagnosed with Stage 4 Classical Hodgkin's Lymphoma.  I remember my father crying on the phone with my sister trying to explain what was happening.  I had aggressive activity in my neck (where it began), around my lungs, around my spleen, and around my bones in my pelvis and hip.  We immediately began treatment with Adriamycin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine, and Dacarbazine.  After 4 treatments, another PET scan was performed and it showed everything was gone except for a small amount in my neck.  This was the first positive news we had received in months.  I'm set to finish chemo on March 9th.  I'm so close to the end, but I still feel so far away and I'm terrified it will return.  In all honesty, the cancer has been tough, but I've begun living my life like I never have before.  I spend more time with friends, I'm planning a vacation in the summer of 2020 to New York, and, all in all, I've started having fun.

And I do mean everywhere: my brain, spine, lungs, ovaries, liver...there's nowhere it hasn't touched.  The only symptoms I had were a slightly sore back and narrower stool. There's nothing the doctors can do, and I have only weeks or days to live. 

Somehow I've been coping semi-okay...at times feeling something like a peace that passes all understanding (though also at times feeling futile anger and sometimes even hope that I'll be miraculously healed, even though I know it's not rational). I've written letters goodbye to my loved ones, made arrangements for after I'm gone, and in general feel ""okay"" about what will happen after my death (despite feeling immense and inexpressible sadness that I won't be there to watch my beautiful baby girl and my amazing nephew grow up and to take care of my husband and family. But that's not the plan for my life, so I have to accept it and move on.)

What I'm having a REALLY hard time with is how my parents and husband and sister will handle my actual dying part. I know that once I'm gone it will be terribly difficult for them (we're all such a close-knit family), but I won't be around to help them deal with that, and just have to trust that God and family and friends will see them through. What I will be around for (presumbly, if I'm not completely unconscious) is watching them deal with my actual death process. My wonderful mom was a nurse for 41 years and my mother-in-law is also a retired nurse, and they want to take care of me as I die at home with the help of hospice. My mom has seen MANY people die in her line of work, but I know that watching her own daughter go through the process will be immeasurably more difficult. And of course my darling husband will take it extremely hard too. :( 

Is there anything I can do to make this whole dying process easier on them? I've read about the things that hospice provides and the care that's required at the end-of-life, and it's terrifying. Oh how I wish I could just pass away peacefully tonight in my sleep!!! Why can't euthanasia be a legal option? I'd so much rather take it than allow my loved ones to suffer needlessly, with no hope. I'm sorry this post is so negative. I don't want my last thoughts and actions on this earth to be that way. But it's unbelievable and incredibly ironic that just five months ago my mom, mother-in-law, and husband were in the delivery room with me while I was in pain waiting for my gorgeous daughter to be born. Now they will have to watch me die, and will get no bundle of joy out of the deal--only a dead daughter and a dead wife. I just wish that I could somehow spare them this. ",2018-05-17 06:53:38

Back in the beginning of July my dad fell ill with what we thought was covid-19. He had all the symptoms and ended up going to the hospital on July 11th. I was on a video call with him trying to calm him down until the paramedics arrived. He couldn’t breathe, It was the most terrifying thing I’ve ever seen in my life. He made a joke as he was leaving and I said “I love you”. I had a panic attack as soon as he was taken by the paramedics. July 16th I landed in Brazil to support my mom(71yo) and wait for my Dad(68) to come out of the hospital. 

While he was at the hospital I took my mother to a Pulmonologist to investigate her breathing, her family doctor suspected she had COPD. 
July 31st my Dad passed away from sepsis after a failed attempt to drain a large abscess in his liver that wasn’t discovered in time, because the doctors thought it was something viral.

3 days after my dad’s death we had an appointment to check my mom’s results. Turns out she had a large tumor in her lung that had already metastasized and also Lymphangitis. Her diagnosis is stage IV squamous lung carcinoma. I’m watching my mom suffer everyday. 

I couldn’t allow myself to mourn my Dad so my mom wouldn’t worry about me. She is the kind of mom that worries more about my afflictions than her own. Now I need to be even stronger not to fall apart because I am her only caregiver.

I am so numb, I cry sometimes but I just feel this dark pit inside of me.People try to talk to me. Ask how I’m doing... I don’t know.. I just lost my dad, he was the best person ever, I couldn’t hug him or say goodbye in person, now I am here watching my mom struggle to breathe, asking God to kill her soon so she doesn’t suffer. I feel powerless, horrible, depressed.

My mom always said that dying without being able to breathe was the most terrifying thing for her, probably the worst way to go after being burned alive. 
And that is exactly what is happening to her. She is terrified. 

She did her first chemotherapy treatment this week and she came out worse than she was going in. 
She doesn’t know what to do. If she should continue the treatment and feel this way with a slim hope of the tumor shrinking or just medicate the pain and wait for her to go.

I don’t know what to say...
I wish the treatment would work, but I don’t know if it will. So I’m afraid of saying she should do it.
But at the same time I’m afraid of telling her not to and missing out a chance to feel a little better.


My father-in-law passed away last year of Lung cancer as well, and before he passed he said if he could go back in time, he wouldn’t have done chemo.
He suffered so much... I’m lost.

It is bitter sweet though, my lung mets have shown a ""small, but significant increase"" bringing the total number of mets to 5 from 1.5 from the previous rounds of Irinotecan (5FU) chemotherapy late last year.

So after putting the phone down to my oncologist, I am going back on 5FU with Irinotecan again and this time I am on Avastin. It should be starting in the next 5-6 days. I am currently on Cloud 9, both me and my finacée are just over the moon. It's just not sunk in yet.

I also want to say that while this sub can be full of heartbreaking stories, not every cancer story ends badly.

194 days ago my son who is 5 (4 at diagnosis) was diagnosed with Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma. This was after we saw a lump that swelled his right eye. We were supposed to have Christmas on that day (26th/Boxing Day in the UK) as my wife had spent most of Christmas Day in hospital herself (Braxton Hicks pains with her pregnancy).

The diagnosis first came in as a brain tumor, likely neuroblastoma which thankfully wasn't the case. Further tests showed it was NHL and was 'brain adjacent', inside the skull and against the brain but not in the brain. This was good news, which led to the bizarre conversation about ""if you had to have a cancer, NHL is the cancer to have"". That is still a strange sentence to say but it's quite true, apparently it's a low comeback rate and a high cure rate, the two things you want the most.

We are now about 6 months or so after that conversation, we have had back to back hard going chemo that caused some horrible side effects and we have been around people whose journeys didn't end as we would have hoped, but we are here now. Today was the end of treatment meeting with the oncologists. We are now officially no longer under treatment and are showing no evidence of disease. The doc didn't really like the words 'in remission' (to him it's just the same as NED) but they fit well here.

We have a lovely 5 year old who is ready to take on the world again. His strength and mobility returns day after day and soon the only reminders of this episode will be a few small scars on his chest from the now removed portcath.

We realise that the paranoia will be there and understand that there is still a journey ahead of us, but to be told we are no longer under treatment was the best delayed Christmas present a dad could ask for.

Now we can look to the future for the first time in ages and I can't wait to see where we go from here.

To those reading this who are not yet at the end of their journey, or who have had this come back, I hope this doesn't discourage or upset you. I hope that the people reading this take happiness in the fact that this can be beaten, that somewhere out there in the real world a little 5 year old can be at home with mum, dad and his two little sisters (the youngest of which was born 1 week after diagnosis - mums water broke while on the ward!).

Does anyone have experience with Gabapentin or Calcitonin (They want to start Calcitonin to strengthen his bones, Gabapentin for pain management- although he refuses to even take Tylenol for pain.) I’ve researched some already, just interested in real world experiences with either of these meds.

Since then, my sister and I have been fortunate enough to visit with her many times despite both of us living far away.  We shared memories, laughs and love and support for dad and each other.  It's been a painful but profound experience for all of us.  Mom went from a creative and active person to a shell of herself in just a matter of 6 months.  Yesterday I was able to say goodbye before I left for the airport.  I got an ""I love you"" and some taps on my shoulder, as it was all the energy would allow her to do.  She fell asleep, and by the time I got back to Ontario she has gotten a lot worse.  Around dinner time my sister called to tell me the news.
Thanks to everyone here who has read my posts and offered their support.
Thanks to Sally who followed our story, and bought me a round trip plane ticket home so that I could see her again, during a time when the grief was so great I couldn't handle something as daunting as making travel arrangements.   I will stick around this subreddit and offer whatever support I can to people that are facing something similar.
Mom was an amazing woman; I'm sure a lot of you would have loved to know her.  Funny, compassionate, warm and caring....and a nurse!  How lucky my family was.
This hurts so much.

The fourth day of my first week of school. As if it couldn't get worse, I was sitting in maths as she texted me my results: Diffuse Astrocytoma. Grade II brain cancer. To say the least I was terrified. This was my last year of school, the best year anyone could possibly have as a teenager and mine was about to be ripped away by a foreign tumour residing in my brain. What followed were many hours spent at my local hospital with a high number of hours of talking to various doctors. My life from then on was a balance of school and hospital.

The first term of school was definitely memorable. I'd gone on a school camp and developed an interesting relationship with one of the boys in my class. He'd sparked new feelings in me that at that point in time I didn't believe I could feel. He made me feel butterflies, good butterflies. Even though everything but that was going downhill my school work had always been the most important thing to me and not once did I let that priority slip. I was getting consistent grades and everyone close to me was proud. 

Second term was a bit of a blur as I was hardly at school, I was drained by what was going on in my body. I didn't see many people and I felt very depressed. 

By term three I had started chemo and my newly titled boyfriend attended as many four hour long sessions as he possibly could. We would sit together on the chair and play super smash bros against one another. I always beat him and I believed that he wasn't letting me. Things became complicated with us as his parents told him that I was a toxin in his life, if he became too attached to me he was likely to plummet once I was gone. They forbid him from talking to me and so began the slow descent on the one thing that made me happy. During that time there were some lovely things happening though. My mother had gotten a new job that she is currently enjoying immensely, my friends made a special speech for me at our awards night (which made me cry very hard and I was a mess when I received two academic awards), and I'd been on a trip to Brisbane with a class of kids from my grade. We had an amazing time together, getting to know one another. But it was on that trip that I had found out my grade II had progressed quickly to grade IV. When I arrived home my mother was a mess. After a few more processes of chemo we were forced to shave my head and it became extremely easy to style in the morning. Between then and now there have been many highs and many lows. 

Last night, was my year 12 formal (http://imgur.com/gBR2xg5). It was the best night of my life so far and I just felt like a normal teenager again, dancing and singing with all my friends. I felt beautiful, something I hadn't felt since February. And now with only a week left of school I'm starting to realise the importance of time. A few weeks ago I was told I only had until after Christmas to live and well, I'm not really prepared to be gone. I still have so much I want to do but I won't ever get to do those things. Like travel to Europe, be a mother or even an auntie, be a godmother to my friend's children, or see my brother graduate and grow up to be the loveliest man in the world. These things are becoming a reality to me now and I'd like to make sure everyone understands just how precious your time here is. 

My journey has been draining and sad but not once did I forget that I was still on this earth and I had to live my life. My friends and family have tried very hard to keep me smiling throughout the year and I'm so grateful for them. Please don't forget to just stop every now and then and think about what you're doing.

After the appointment, I went into the pedestrian zone because I needed something from a store. I was wearing my face mask  because of my bad blood levels (my latest chemo-session was just a week beforehand), and stood in front of the store, minding my own business, when a girl (she was around 15y old) stood beside me and coughed in my direction. I was shocked and went a few steps away, as she returned to her group of friends, laughing and thinking it was a great joke. 

Normally, I wouldn't have said anything. But her laughing made me angry, so I decided to face her.  I told her, in a calm tone, that not all mask-wearing people are just scared for COVID-19. I told her that I have cancer and bad blood levels, and how rude her behaviour was, but I guess she didn't listen to me. She got insolent and defensive before she left, as if I was the bad person for pointing out her wrongdoing. 

I don't know why, but this incident still affects me. Why are some people so stupid? Her age is no excuse in this matter, she is - theoretically speaking - old enough to know that there are serious reasons why someone is wearing a face mask. Today, I still have no signs for a flu or a fever, hence I can assume that she really just faked that coughing, so there is no harm done. But oh boy I am still mad at that brat.",2020-03-09 19:24:17

We started at a smaller hospital that initially diagnosed her with stage 3 triple negative breast cancer. They told us it was aggressive but they’d cure it. After rounds of chemo, then a mastectomy, then radiation, the cancer metastasized to her brain. We were now at stage 4. 

We switched to a more renowned hospital. More chemo. More radiation. Gamma knife. All of it. We had zero doubts in our mind, as rough as the road got, she’d be a breast cancer survivor. She’d be one of the 22% of women and men who survive stage 4 breast cancer. 

Monday, the doctor told us the the cancer had spread beyond the liver, the bones, the brain and wherever else it had spread to in the past 2 years, to the spinal and brain fluid. 

Leptomeningeal metastasis. Whatever the hell that is. Before this, her oncologist had lots of different options for us. But this.....this is it. The doctor who had kept our hope alive told us that it’s time to transition to hospice. Once diagnosed, you basically have 4-6 weeks to live. It is only seen in 3-5% of all cancer cases and it happened to our survivor. 

My sister is the smartest person I’ve ever known. She had just finished year 1 at a top 10 law school on a full ride scholarship when she was diagnosed. I remember the pride (and slight disappointment lol) I felt when she said Duke Law accepted her and offered her money but that wasn’t the school for her. I remember the pride I felt when after months of chemo treatments, she went to interview with some of the best firms in the world for a summer internship. I celebrated her wins and callbacks with her. I scoffed at the firms that just weren’t good enough with her. 

She graduated top of her class in undergrad. She would mostly likely be a lawyer for a top firm or somebody incredibly important......now she can’t tell me where she is. She confuses basic words or makes up new words. She can’t get her thoughts across. She’s in a state of delirium (another new word for me). 

My sister is my hero. I try so hard not to cry when I play along with her hallucinations. I can’t help myself from crying when I see my parents who were so incredibly proud of my sister and all of her accomplishments watch their child’s life come to an end in the most painful way possible. 

When she’s lucid, she tells me how scared she is and how she’s not ready to give up fighting. We were supposed to live long, successful lives. There is no more fight. I’ve spent hours looking up clinical trials. There are 11 recruiting right now for leptomeningeal mets and most of them exclude her for one reason or another. 

Whether anyone reads this or not, I just needed to get my thoughts out there. I talk to no one about this. Most people in my life have no idea what’s going on except for family. I don’t know how I’m going to listen to people talk about their siblings when I’m losing mine. How parents can talk about their children knowing my parents watched theirs deteriorate in the worst way. 

My sister is my person. I don’t know what’s next and I’m too scared to find out.",2019-04-26 07:25:51

Mom passed last June from Liver and Bile Duct Cancer and many of you in this group have helped me through this experience.  I thought I'd share something that happened to me today on the way to work that brought me some peace.

I've spent a lot of time crying because mom had to leave, and witnessing how quickly her health diminished each time I traveled down to see her was excruciating.  Having good friends and an excellent partner in life has been very helpful.  I even saw a therapist for a while, but of course, the pain continued.

It wasn't until today that on my way to work I had a random memory of hitting a home run in little league decades ago, and mom whistled the way only she could-- and then yelled out ""yay, Dave!!""  She made me a special dinner that night.  

Before I parked my car at work a big smile came across my face because SHE was my  mom....and that made me feel so lucky.  It was the first memory I've had since she left that brought me a smile.  I think that's a small stepping stone in the grieving process.

To those of you going through this with a loved one, things will get better.  Grief is a long process and you just have to let it happen.  One day you'll have a fond memory come to you and the happy will perhaps outweigh the sad; even for just a moment.

I hope that helps.

It had been undiagnosed for a few months and was too aggressive to treat, so we opted to pursue hospice care instead.

I had to fly from another coast to see her before she passed. By then she could no longer speak and only occasionally opened her eyes, as if to acknowledge that she knew we were with her. She looked older and more mortal than I'd ever seen her.

Then, just two days later, she was gone. Two weeks after her diagnosis, she was gone - just like that.

It happened too fast to even comprehend that my mom had just died at 60. I kept myself busy by planning a memorial ceremony for the weekend and talking to relatives I hadn't seen in years. I felt useful again; I could forget about the powerlessness and the death and the gaping hole where my mother had been.

Being surrounded by people gave me a purpose - a reason to focus on something or someone else. Tonight, I flew back home and returned to my apartment, empty except for myself, for the first time. And this is the hardest part, because the constant attention of other people is beginning to fade; now I have to start to manage my own thoughts, like ""I'm never getting a cute little text from my mom at 9 pm ever again.

That was a week ago yesterday. Friday night we moved her into hospice. Yesterday I barely got to tell her happy Mother’s Day before she slipped into an Ativan and morphine sleep. Today her breathing is decidedly worse, it could be any day now. I keep telling her it’s okay to go. She’s hanging on for something.

553,Mom isn't going to make it,96,b3w9f3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/b3w9f3/mom_isnt_going_to_make_it/,15,1553232435.0,"My mom is currently dying of an aggressive type of cancer. We have no idea how long she's had this tumor, only that its spread so fast that she has little chance of fighting it off.

Earlier this year she was diagnosed with it following a buildup of fluid in her lungs and she did her chemo shortly afterwards. Just a few days later, her right leg suffered an arterial blood clot due to the tumor and had to be amputated leaving her both crippled and in pain.

Her health then began deteriorating rapidly (up to the time that I write this) and my siblings and I have accepted that this is the end for her. She's in her bed right now sedated and slowly dying as her organs are appearing to shut down with every passing day. Just recently she stared having seizures which we suspect was due to the cancer reaching her brain.

To say she was a good person is an understatement. She raised four kids almost on her own and sacrificed an endless amount to get us where we are today, by far one of the strongest people I know of. She helped out heavily in the religious community and gave donations to those in need. And for all she's done this is how she gets rewarded. 

I'm not even religious but I've been praying with her and my family in hopes that whatever God there is can let her be in peace for crying out loud.

I just want her to pass on instead of living in all of this pain. She doesn't deserve to die like this.

I'm not the kind to write huge blocks of text but this was the best I can do to describe the situation. I'm just relived to finally get this off of me. Thank you for reading.

Edit: Hello all and thank you for your support and condolences. I regret to inform to you that early this morning my mom passed away in her sleep. I greatly appreciate the support that this sub has given. You've been a great comfort through this troubling time.

Again, thank you and love you all <3

Dad, 

Thank you for everything. You were the most important person in my life. You were and always will be my hero and my role model. You are the greatest man I know. I wouldn’t be half the man I am today without you.

Someday when I have kids and a wife, I’ll make sure they know about who you are, and how great of a person you were

I know you told me you’d live vicariously through me after you passed, so I’ll do everything in my power to live a life that would make you proud. All I ever wanted in life was to make you proud.

I was diagnosed a little over a year ago at age 19 with malignant melanoma. I didn’t take it as serious at first because it’s ""just skin cancer"", but boy did that change quick. I was initially diagnosed Stage 3C, then after the first treatment failed, it grew rapidly resulting in me needing a ten hour surgery that was very difficult to recover from. The surgery was successful in removing the cancer in the area they worked on, but I developed immense pain in my leg soon afterwards which turned out to be one of five bone mets spread across my body that lit up on a PET scan. This obviously put me into Stage IV since my primary was on the very top of my head. 

In a recent trip to the acute care at my cancer hospital, masses on my left adrenal gland, and possibly the right as well, were found. However, I wasn't even phased by the news. I've now learned that cancer will do what it wants, when it wants. It doesn't care who you are or what's happening in your life or how young you are. I've had, and still have, my ""why me?"" moments, but I've come to learn that being negative about my situation will do nothing good. Whatever will happen, will happen, and there's nothing I can do to fight the inevitable. 

I  understand now that this is something I will be more than likely fighting for a very long time. It could even be the end of me, but to dwell on that is no way I want to live my life. I'm often stuck in bed in pain or sick from some other bullshit side effect from treatment, but this stupid ugly disease has made me the most grateful I've ever been in my young life.

He also told me I should have my Primary Care run a CEA test.

But OMG the food. No wonder 20% of cancer patients starve to death. On the 3rd day after surgery the meal was so bad I burst into tears (which hurts like a mother fucker with staples in your belly). 

Then I called my favorite restaurant near the hospital and the boss ran me up my dinner. I hugged and cried on him too.

But I did get to leave on the 4th day. The poor weekend doctor came in to examine me to see if I was able to go home. I was dressed, packed and waiting for my T3 prescription to be written. That young fella had quite a funny look on his face but didn't attempt to stand in my way.

I couldn't understand why my nether regions felt like the aftermath of an '80s orgy but apparently, I got a bonus colonoscopy and lady bits exam. Yeah, me.

But the good news is Artie the Ass Tumor is no more. He was completely encapsulated and hadn't gone where he shouldn't.  Plenty of margins so my poop bag is temporary (and not as bad as you would think - don't be scared of it just don't eat hard-boiled eggs).

While the surgeon was in there he took a look-see at Larry the Liver who was looking great. The Daryll Tumors are still there of course but you couldn't tell by looking.

She'd been feeling pain for some time but kept it to herself until it was too late. A biopsy later revealed it was breast cancer that had metastasized to her bones. The doctors gave her six months to live without treatment so Mom opted to start treatment right away, but due to poor health insurance, the current Covid epidemic, and the pitfalls of bureaucracy she didn't get into the hospital until over a month later.

Since her health was already deteriorating so fast she basically had lost the ability to walk on her own at this point. There was a tumor on her spine and the doctors said if she didn't have surgery to remove it soon that she would be paralyzed for the remainder of her life. She had a spinal fusion which went well and at this point we were all hopeful and talking about life after moving her back home to live with everyone.
Since time was of the essence and she and everyone in our family agreed that she wanted to pursue treatment, she was given hormone therapy and her first round of chemo within a week of her surgery. Unfortunately, a few days later she developed pneumonia. Shortly thereafter, she had developed sepsis and a host of other infections and was put on a ventilator. At this point the doctors were already recommending palliative care and taking her off the ventilator to ""die with dignity."" One by one her organs began to fail her. First her right lung collapsed. Then her kidney started failing.

And finally last night, I watched her die through a phone. For me, the worst part about this was that I couldn't be there for her in person. I live abroad in China, and do to the current epidemic I cannot come back here if I were to leave and go back to the States. I have a wife and family here, so I opted to stay with the hope that she would get better and I could visit next year. Unfortunately, it didn't work out. 

She kept her eyes open the whole night until she finally fell asleep. I looked into her eyes and could see that she wasn't ready to go. My family that was with her were doing their best to send her off peacefully, but I got a little frustrated that they just kept offering her platitudes about going in peace, like they were just waiting for her to die, when it was so clear that she didn't want to go yet.

In the aftermath, I'm feeling immense anger and guilt. Anger towards a medical system that I view as having failed her. If she had never opted for treatment and just gotten palliative care, it's likely that she would have had more time and wouldn't have had to spend her last weeks on a ventilator in so much suffering. Anger that we all trusted the doctors and yet she died within weeks of entering the hospital. I'm no doctor, but in hindsight it seems clear that she was too weak to start treatment and needed more time to recover from her surgery and really make an informed decision whether treatment was the best course of action. It feels like the whole situation was so rushed.

And of course, guilt that I wasn't there for her in her greatest time of need. I'm her only son, and when she needed me most I wasn't there for her. We only got to have one conversation while she could still speak, and it was so rushed and hectic. Thanks to China banning all foreigns apps, I could not communicate with her directly even with a VPN and had to rely on my Aunt who had WeChat to video with her. Even though I got to say goodbye and speak with her at the end, it still doesn't feel the same as a real conversation would have. I don't know if I will ever forgive myself for not going back to see her and hug her one last time. 

That's all I have to say. I don't have many friends so it helps to get these feelings off my chest anonymously. Having experienced this first hand, I empathize so much more now with everyone here as I've been reading your experiences these last couple months.

This epidemic is a crisis, and that demands sacrifices, but it's tragic that people who have gone through so much, surviving months or years of chemo, radiation, surgery, and more, will not get the care they need and deserve. 

NYC hospitals now have a no visitor policy, unless the patient is end-of-life or incapacitated. Is your family member disabled, hard of hearing, or anxious? You can't help them. You can't be there. You just wait and hope they get out alive. 

That's if they get in the hospital at all; beds have already become scarce, and soon people ill with CoVid-19 will take them. That doctor, that room, that equipment that would handle a whipple procedure or lung resection will now go towards a patient that needs a ventilator. Surgeries are already being deferred, and, if they're not, the patient must recover in an environment latent with infection. They can't win.

Radiation has converted to the shortest courses necessary. For example, a typically long radiation course for colorectal cancer has been reduced to 5 days to minimize office visits and exposure.  Labs are closing indefinitely, delaying life-saving research. Doctors that normally request an office visit to help someone with, say, a neutropenic fever will err on the side of caution and have them stay home. Sometimes it won't be the right gamble.

Ultimately, lives will be shortened, lives will be lost. Not just by the hand of CoVid-19, but everything that comes with it. There will be a long tail of PTSD and anxiety for patients, caregivers, and healthcare workers when this is 'over'. I don't begrudge any institution for these choices, though I wish exceptions could be made. I simply lament what we'll lose.",2020-03-21 09:34:28

It lasted one month. I had a brain tumour cut out within two days of working out where it was at the back of my head then 3 rounds of GemOx to try to make it stick.

It got back down to 2 at the end of last November so had two lung resecctions to try to make it sick. It didn't.

At the start of January with it back up to 20 I had cyberknife of 3 old spots in my brain just in case and one New spot in my lung zapped by radiation therapy. That dropped to 3.

This week it's come back as 8. I'm running very low of options and the oncologist is telling me it's time to make the serious decision about what to do going forward. Cure is very unlikely.

I think it goes without saying that I was beyond nervous especially since the last final was worth 40% of my grade and while taking it, my mind felt so slow and clouded from just having finished 5 days of chemo and I just felt pretty awful coming out of it.

In some ways I am grateful that he did not suffer long, but I wish so much for more time together. 

In the end he went very peacefully. The day before he died, we had a wonderfully lucid day together. He was more alert than I’d seen him all week. He told me he was ready to go and that he loved me. I will forever cherish that moment. He also spent a lot of time staring at something spectacular, very faintly saying “wow” over and over again. I’ve read that Steve Jobs did this exact thing before he passed. I like to think he was seeing the transition from this dimension into the next. He seemed so happy. He fell asleep that night and never woke up again. Yesterday, on the day of his passing, he slept all day, softly breathing. He never had the “death rattle” and up until the end he still had perfect vitals and porcelain skin. He waited until we had all fallen asleep and then slipped away quietly, on his own terms. Just about as peaceful as you can hope for.

Do you know what it's like to physically have to help hold down my 3 year old every week for spinal taps? Or have to go into the emergency room every time he gets in the slightest fever when every ER visit means we will be there for a minimum of 5 hours and his port will be accessed? You know how easy it is to get a 3 year old to eat anything....well it's even more fun trying to get him to take his daily chemo medication. It's like all of the fun has just been sucked out of our lives. My 6 year old is great but he's still 6 year old and doesn't really care if my husband and I are tapped out. When my son was first diagnosed, we had many people and family offer to help with our older son. I am so done with friends or family telling us to ""just let them know how they can help"" and then never actually follow through on taking our older son for some fun. I am not expecting people to rearrange their own lives/schedules/families to help but God I feel like it's such an empty promise when you say this and then never actually follow through. 

And guess what? No one is signing up watch your child with leukemia so my husband and I could possibly have a second to breathe. I am stay-at-home right now and for the unforeseen future and it's all just too much. I see no one besides my children and my husband and our doctors. Should I go get therapy? Should everyone in our family go get therapy? Should we all be able to have some fun as a family? Yep but that's just not the way it works with this whole cancer situation. We are just heading into cold and flu season and I swear I'm getting hives over my anxiety over how many trips we will make to the hospital with fevers. I just want so badly to just say fuck it for a day. I just want to have a day-off for my family. I just want to wake up and have this all be a bad dream. I don't recognize myself or my life and I am just unrationally mad when I see families breeze in and out of the emergency room with a broken leg or something like that. I am exhausted by keeping a brave face for my little 3 year old who is just the best and constantly in pain. Due to his specific situation, he  is not walking....he can't even stand up. He used to be on toddler soccer team and could make it up little climbing walls and now he can't even stand. I see families with kids crossing the street at a red light and I'm mad at them - for having to live our life and this makes me frustrated with myself. I don't even know what the point of this post is. I guess I am wondering if there are any other parents out there like us who can relate. I'm not even looking for ideas of what I can do to make my situation more bearable because it's just hard....it hopefully won't be this hard always but right now it's just hard and it's even harder feeling like I'm isolated in this cancer/stay-at-home parent nightmare.

Back at the end of November my oncologist gave me my prognosis, ""12-14 Months"".  I told him I wasn't going to die from this.

A week ago yesterday, I had my post-treatment MRI.  GBM is so aggressive, that the goal of chemo/radiation treatment is to slow down the cancer's grownth.  Mine didn't grow at all!!  This is even more exciting because I didn't get started with chemo and radiation until a month after my initial surgery.

In addition to not growing, even with a month where it should have grown like crazy, the tumor is mostly dead!!  

Yesterday, I got started with a new treatment, [Tumor Treatment Fields](http://www.onclive.com/conference-coverage/aacr-2017/tumor-treating-fields-substantially-improve-survival-in-gbm), which is a set of electrodes that I wear on my head all day, and it zaps the cancer as it tries to grow.

I'll also start my new round of chemotherapy as soon as the pills get to me.  It's going to be a lot bigger dose than my first round.  Between the TTF and chemo, I really believe my cancer will finish dying soon.  

I just want everyone reading this, to stay positive.  I wasn't supposed to live long, I stayed positive, now I will live.  My radiation oncologist told me he's seen patient attitude change prognosis many times.  He's seen people who should have lived, that had a poor attitude, and just gave up, who died quickly.  He's seen people who should have died quickly, who kept positive, who beat their cancer, and lived.  Personally, I watched my grandpa give up when he was diagnosed, and he died extremely quickly.  Long before I was born, my grandma was told she'd be dead in a year, she stayed positive and fought it, and she's still here almost 60 years later.

I'm not saying to skip treatment and just stay happy and hope to live.  I'm saying it helps.  ",2018-03-03 03:12:05

My Mom and I have been taking turns driving Dad up to Penn every single weekday for cancer treatment. On the days that I go, Dad and I have a routine. I wheel him to the cancer center, we check-in, and then I go get both of us coffees and muffins from Starbucks while he waits to be seen. He always gets a warm blueberry muffin and an Americano. I usually return - snacks in hand - before he even leaves the waiting room. Well... the woman in front of me at Starbucks today bought the last blueberry muffin. The cashier checked the back. Checked the front. Muffinless. 

""My Dad's in treatment for cancer and this muffin is the one thing he looks forward to about coming up here"" I stammer over the giant lump in my throat. Tears begin to roll down my face. I'm turning beet red. I'm losing control. I'm overwhelmed. I'm angry. I'm sad. My emotions are bubbling over. The cashier apologizes profusely, obviously uncomfortable about my impending emotional outburst. I settle for a blueberry scone, give her my money, and immediately scramble to the corner of the room where I hide my face and wipe my tears... embarrassed. 

I feel a hand on my shoulder. I look up to find a middle aged black woman in business attire staring down at me. ""I just wanna give you a hug."" she says. I melt into her embrace as she soothes me saying ""I know honey, it's hard. I lost my father to cancer last year. It's okay to cry. It's okay to feel. You'll be okay. There are just some things that you can't control. Even muffins."" We part with a smile. I thank her for her kind words. She leaves with a friend, coffee in hand.

I wasn't sure if I would last 6 months, but now I am here, at non detectable levels. I have a future to look forward to and life that wouldn't be possible without the hard work and dedication of the trained physicians and doctors. 

I had meant to write more about what it all means to me, but a part of me didnt want to acknowledge the journey I was embarking on. A lot of it is too hard to think about. I did my best to stay strong for my family, with only a handful of breakdowns. But through it all, I tried focusing on the future and trying creating the best memories possible.

I have a lot to celebrate on this day, but the current state of affairs has got me feeling very helpless and vulnerable. It seems the dam is about to break where I live and everyone fed up with the lockdown is defying stay at home and refusing to wear masks. I hope for nothing more than this crisis to pass, but I really hope people don't have to start losing their own loved ones before they start taking it serious.

This has been my life for the last 2 1/2 years. I know a lot of you have it worse. And I wanna a lot worse, so, I just want you to know, I dont want to complain or seem like I am boasting. 

I had my last vincristine today, and I just have tablets until 3rd July. I officially go into remission 4th July.

I don’t know how to feel. On one hand, it’s a relief. I have finally stopped and I can go back to normal. But on the other hand, I’m scared. I’m scared that my leukaemia will relapse. I’m scared to have my bone marrow test and portacath removal surgery. 

I’m scared that my friends I have made since I was diagnosed will leave me. I feel like they were only friends out of sympathy. They tell me that’s stupid, but I really think that. 

I’m nervous to go back to  school full time, after 2 1/2 years out of school.

I’m frustrated that it has robbed my life.

I’m guilty for surviving this, when my friend didn’t survive (he was 13. Rest his soul).

I’m annoyed that I’m covered in scars.

I’m upset that I have gained 20lbs since starting treatment. I look fat now.

I’m annoyed at how the medications made me ugly (chubby face, gained weight, chemo spots, rashes,etc) 

I’m annoyed at how it’s changed me.

I’m annoyed that it has stolen my teenage years, and will rob the rest of them as I have been forced to grow up. 

As well as this, I don’t know what to do with my life. I mean, I get to start going to my drama group soon, swimming club, school. But I don’t know what to do in between now and when I’m back in those groups. Like, what do i do?

Unfortunately, his oncologist recommended that he stop chemo and focus on palliative care. She said it as kindly and concisely as she could to a roomful of his loved ones (his mother, step-father, father, aunt and myself). 

It wasn't the news we were hoping to hear but, after conferring with the radialogist regarding his brain scan results, the oncologist said that there was no point in continuing chemo to treat the tumors in his other body parts when the cancer in his brain was not manageable. She said that he had days or weeks but not months. We all cried and hugged each other. 

The whole day was like a dream afterwards. The future I pictured for us was shattered. My fiance was kept for a few hours to get fluids into him because he was dehydrated and I drove us home after. Throughout it all he still refused to give up. Other than our initial cry session in the doctor's office he showed no other worry about the results. I asked him on the ride back home what his thoughts were and he insisted that he would still beat it. I didn't have the heart to do anything but agree and I still don't. 

Two days later we were packing up and heading to his father's beach house for some rest and relaxation. Two days after that it was decided that we would stay here from here on out and that I would receive some help with the caregiver duties (after his older brother walked an hour in my shoes when I had a particularly hard day involving several dirty adult diapers and called him for help). 

Now, he is snoring away in a hospital bed in his father's livingroom after a full day of festivities. However many days he has left I'm making it my mission for him to enjoy every single one. ",2018-11-23 13:11:13

 I’ve been suffering from horrible back pain all year, and here I was thinking it was all my time at the computer doing online classes giving me back pain! According to my doctor I’ve got a 10 x 15cm tumor on my liver, pressing into my diaphragm and stomach. Regional spread to lymph nodes. Been through one round of chemo and getting my port put in tomorrow. it’s been a crazy three weeks for me. 

I guess it’s my family, that’s the hardest part. This year was supposed to be a big deal for me, graduating college and moving out into the world and whatnot, but instead I’m stuck at home in lots of pain, getting bizarre (to me) medical treatments and generally just laying around exhausted. I can handle that sort of thing, life is full of these types of challenges after all, but it’s my family that makes it tough. My mother and father have to see me like this, my younger siblings have watched their older brother turn into what seems like an old man. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is, that even though I am the one suffering through cancer, it’s seeing the way it affects those around me that hurts the most. I hate feeling like I’m ruining everything for them. Like their perfect life was derailed because i decided to get a disease that statistically I shouldn’t even have!!! I worry that, if I die, this will affect them in ways I can’t imagine. Maybe I’m just being vain, but I really just wanted to vent 

Let me know if any of you have been through something like this, and if anyone else here has experience with Intra-Hepatic Bile Duct cancer I could sure use some pointers because I’m new at this!

The cancer did not go into remission, he was not NED at all, but they made a huge thing about his last round. 

He had to go for an emergency operation as his tumor grew and blocked his colon. He could not pass anything, not gas not solids, nothing.
Now he is on a machine that keeps him breathing as his lungs are shot. The oncologist told him not to stop smoking as his body won’t be able to take the stress.

Last night was the first time he woke up as he was in a coma. His daughter said that he can’t understand what is going on. Why he has tubes in every hole in his body. AFAIK the doctor did a colostomy for him.

But still, after ringing the bell and making a huge fuss. The false hope it gave him that he was done with cancer and then few days later cancer almost took him out?

I wanted to share a few details about the procedure for anyone who may be interested in signing up as well. 

https://m.imgur.com/HVtcohk

I wanted to share my story of donating bone marrow so that anyone else who is considering it or has questions about it may be a bit more informed.

In Feb of 2017 I was scrolling social media and saw an add to join the Be The Match registry. I thought to myself, “I have no reason not to do this. I’m going to sign up.” However, life distracted me and I never did. 2 weeks later I began the next book in the series of my favorite author, Harlan Coben (amazing thriller/murder mystery novelist), and it was about a boy who needed a bone marrow donation and the donor ghosted. I immediately signed up on the registry this time.

Exactly one year later, I received a phone call and an email stating that I was a potential match for a 13 year old girl with Sever Aplastic Anemia, a life threatening immune system disease. I immediately agreed to go through with the procedure.

The process involves an over the phone health surgery, an additional blood screen and a physical exam. Afterwards, the wait began. However, the patient experience multiple setbacks that delayed the donation twice. Finally, in late March 2019, the procedure was a go.

I must say that Be The Match is amazing. Not one dime out of pocket between the hospital visits, the procedure, or anything. They even flew my mom in to watch our 4 month old daughter.

The procedure went really smoothly. There are two ways to donate. One is surgical and one is through a process more like giving blood. My patient’s doctor requested the surgical procedure. Anyway, they used general anesthesia to put me under and used. Hollow needle to penetrate my hip bones from the back in two small incisions. From there they extracted  liters of bone marrow. I was in and out of the hospital within 5 hours. 

The procedure was painless obviously because I was under, but the recovery has a few pains and aches with it. Honestly, it is not horrible. I was super exhausted for 2 days due to the anesthesia and the amount of marrow extracted. The site of the procedure cause some aching in my lower back. It’s more discomfort than pain. They provide adequate medication to help with this. Honestly, the hardest part is just taking it easy for me. I’m a “always on the move” guy. Anyways I’m 3 days post-op and can move with very little limitation or discomfort. It’s still sore and achey, but nothing serious. I would donate again tomorrow if I needed to.

I hope this provides insight into the process and please feel free to ask any questions. Also, please let me know if you decide to sign up. It really is an opportunity to give someone else another shot at life.

635,My Son is recovering from a tumor which was removed from his head,85,b3tixn,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/b3tixn/my_son_is_recovering_from_a_tumor_which_was/,30,1553219007.0,"Last Tuesday, I took my 16-year-old son, Josh, to see his doctor about an issue he had been having with his right leg. He would constantly feel like his knee was going to ""give out"" on him when he walked. I had noticed more and more that his gait had changed, and he had trouble getting around.

His doctor asked some questions, observed him walking around in the examination room, tested his strength, etc., and suggested that we take him to see a neurologist. Not even an hour later, she called my wife to say that she felt like he should be seen ASAP and if an appointment couldn't be made with neurology, then we should take  him into the ER for a CT scan.

The next day (Wednesday) my wife took him into the ER for a scan. The scan detected a mass in his brain, and some swelling. He was transferred via ambulance to the Betsy Devos Children's hospital. A MRI confirmed that he had a tumor in his head.

Thursday, he had lost all feeling/movement in his right arm, and had trouble moving his right leg. By Saturday, the right side of his mouth was drooping a bit as he lost muscle tone in his face. I left the hospital with plans to return on Monday for a meeting with Josh's surgeon, and the word from doctors was that his operation to remove the tumor would be on Thursday.

However, on Sunday Josh's surgeon decided that he had deteriorated enough that they needed to operate on Monday. The operation was a success; 100% of the tumor was removed. On Tuesday night, he was returned to the operating table for a suspected blood clot. As it turned out, fluid had gotten trapped inside the space left behind by the removed tumor, and pressure was building in his head.

He is currently recovering in ICU. Between Monday and Tuesday, he was constantly sleeping. When awokened, he was able to communicate with hand motions. He has not spoken since Monday morning prior to his surgery.

I am grateful that his surgery was scheduled earlier than expected, and also that the tumor was entirely removed. I just wish that he was able to talk, and that we could focus on working with him to get the use of his right arm and leg back. We are also waiting for the results of the biopsy to come back, so that we have a better idea of what kind of tumor it was.",2019-03-22 01:43:27

I’m not a mom but forever a daughter. I bought my mom’s favorite flowers, and they’re sitting by a picture of her.  I’m going on a walk to a place she loved ... and will probably have a good cry. I’m avoiding brunch places and such and will spend much of the rest of the day at home.  I’m still not ready to see people with their moms on this day.  It doesn’t get *easier* but eventually you get used to the new world without mom and the pain becomes less raw and less overpowering.

Against all odds she had a really good 2019 despite the illness and even went to work (she was a teacher). But this year everything went downhill, her body stopped receiving food and went really skinny. Due to the pandemic all travels were restricted and I live in another city so it was impossible for me to visit her until two weeks ago. Her last days were awful she barely could manage to breathe and I cannot forgive myself for not spending more time with her. The images of it's last days are haunting me and I don't know how to deal with it.

I had had my craniotomy 6 days prior, and had been home from the hospital for 2 days.  Before my surgery they told me, ""Next Friday, you'll come back to get your biopsy results"".  It didn't quite go that way.

Before surgery, they told me if ""*X* bad thing happens during surgery, you'll be moved to the ICU instead of this room"".  I don't remember what it was, but it happened, and that next morning, I woke up in the ICU.  

A doctor who I had never seen face-to-face, but was involved with my surgery, came into my room, said ""It looks like cancer"", then turned around and walked away.

I was released from the hospital that Monday, with the plan for me to return to the hospital to meet my oncologist and get my biopsy results on Friday.  That Wednesday, my wife was at work, and my kids were at school.  I was home alone all day.

I got a phone call from the hospital.  I figured they were just calling to remind me of my appointment.  NOPE.  They verified it was me on the line, and told me ""Biopsy results are back early.  You have Glioblastoma.  Get your affairs in order, you have a few months"".

Being home alone, I broke down.  Then I spent the next 2 days reading about this monster in my brain.  Friday finally rolls around, and my wife and I go to my appointment.  I knew about all there is to know about this beast, I knew my prognosis, I knew it all.  I told my oncologist, who I was meeting for the first time, ""I'm gonna kick this thing"".  He replied, ""No, you're not"".

Well, I'm still here.  My tumor stayed stable for about 6 months.  Then it steadily shrank for another 6 months.  A year ago, my doc stopped chemo, my only 'treatment' now is cannabis oil and a few vitamins and supplements, it's still not growing.  I started out with a lemon sized tumor, and now it's a marble.

In order to get this drug I have to pay two grand per injection and would need an injection every few weeks.

Part of it had collapsed and investigative surgery found his ribcage lined with cancer. He was 58 years old and the strongest, healthiest, fittest man the doctors had ever met for his age. 
He outright refused chemo and ended up qualifying for Keytruda, so we went that route instead. A few months in and it just wasn't working. My dad opted to try a pseudoscientific treatment that insurance wouldn't cover... that obviously didn't work either. 

We took a big family trip while he was still walking. He was in pain for most of it. Now he is bed ridden, won't eat anything but jello, and is usually delirious. He's so tiny and frail. He weighed 200 lbs at 6'1 last year. Now he probably weighs 140. 

It's so hard for me to see him waste away. I don't understand my emotions. Instinctively, I'm trying to distance myself, like I'm cushioning for the blow. But that is so selfish. I force myself to stay close, help when he needs it, and tell him I love him as often as I can. Sometimes my own strength scares me. Sometimes I can talk as openly about what is happening as if I'm telling the weather. Other times I just break at random moments and sob until my throat is raw. But I only let him see the strong in me; the rock on the outside; the brave little warrior I've always been for him.

The hardest part for me was admitting to myself that I first felt relief rather than sadness when she passed. 

I was told that hearing was one of the last senses to go, I whispered to her to let go and be at peace that we would be okay. She passed a few hours later.
Tonight, just thinking about that moment broke me. 
The fact that I won’t be able to hug and kiss her again, hurts so much. 

Cancer is fucking horrible, it took my mum before she got to see me graduate, hold my future kids, see me get married and most of all - it took her away before I had a chance to repay her for all she’s done for me.

650,This shit sucks,83,9iooj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/9iooj6/this_shit_sucks/,51,1537874534.0,"I'm 18 years old, I graduated from high school this past June, and I had one of the best summers of my life. Senior week down at the beach; a full week of nonstop partying with some of my closest friends. Immediately after, I went a week-long cruise down to the Caribbean - my first time travelling outside the United States. My mom, aunt, uncle, and I traveled to Grand Turk, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic, where I saw water that I never thought could be so brilliantly blue (it was tough returning back north and seeing the familiar murky gray of Delaware beaches haha). I worked outside all summer long as a lifeguard and recently got promoted to head guard. After summer ended, I was going to take some gen eds at a community college for the first semester and then transfer into the University of Pittsburgh (my dream school) in January where I planned to do Army ROTC and major in Criminal Justice for the next 4 years of my life.

About a month ago I started to notice that my lymph nodes on my neck were swelling up. I had one of them do this before a few years ago and it eventually went back down so I didn't really think much of it at first. A couple weeks later, I began noticing that I had similar swollen glands in my armpits and around my groin, so I went to the doctor, figuring that I had some weird sickness and that they could throw me some antibiotics and clear it right up. They ran some blood tests and couldn't figure out what was wrong with me. A couple appointments later, I had an awful headache and a sore throat; my tonsils looked like shit. My parents figured that I had Mono or something, which honestly made sense. All summer, partying with friends, sharing drinks, I could definitely see it happening. The doctors office did swabs for both Mono and Strep, both of which came back negative. My physician ad no idea what I had, so she recommended that I go over to the emergency room and have an infectious disease doc look at me there. Went to the ER where I had a *grand* ol time that night. They poked and prodded me until about 3 am and told me to get a biopsy done on my nodes to see what the deal was. They said that it might just be some strange virus, but that it might be something more sinister like Lymphoma. They couldn't be sure until I got the biopsy done though, so that was the next step.

Went to go see an ear, nose, and throat doctor about the lumps and the biopsy and got the biopsy done on one of the nodes under my chin a couple days later. The results came back as positive for Lymphoma. Went to the cancer center a couple days ago where the doc there effectively told me that my entire life was going to be turned upside down for the next few months. The doc I visited in the cancer center also took a bone marrow sample from my tailbone and I swear to god that has to  be the most humiliating procedure of all time.

My lymphoma is aggressive and malignant, and because it's aggressive, it needs to be met with an equally aggressive treatment. The initial chemo is going to be at least a week long and I'm getting admitted to the cancer center this Wednesday (9/26) to start it. The treatment is going to last for several months, which may mean that I might not be able to go to Pitt in January and even if I do, I probably wouldn't be able to start ROTC this year, which I was *really* looking forward to. I'm probably going to lose my hair, too yay!

Maybe it's just me, but I can't fucking *stand* sympathy. I absolutely despise it. I don't want people to feel sorry for me. I don't want people to go *aww poor guy* and feel bad for me. That's bullshit. I don't want to be looked down on and pitied, yet that's all that I can see around me at this point. The only person who's made me feel better about it was my best best friend Sam (if you're reading this, I love you buddy). When I told him I had cancer, he just laughed and said, ""Ha! That sucks! At least you can go on a rampage like Archer now!""

That was beautiful and perfect. I just want to be treated the same as I was before I had cancer. I don't want to be the hushed conversation topic at everyone's house, I just want to feel normal damn it. I really hate that ""warrior"" stuff, too. I don't feel like a warrior at all, I feel like some unlucky asshat who got cancer. Like it sucks and the treatments are going to be tough, but I just don't see the victims of cruel circumstances as ""warriors"". Sure, they can be tough and resilient, but calling someone stuck in a hospital bed a ""warrior"" just seems demeaning to me. Just my own opinion on the subject.

Gonna be going in this Wednesday to be admitted to the cancer center. They're gonna pull out the sutures in my chin from my biopsy and shove some big tube into my chest and heart to mainline this chemo shit. Sounds like a good time.

Sorry for the short novel, just kinda needed to get this off my chest because the past couple weeks has kinda been a massive slap in the dick. Feels bad, but I don't want people to pity me and I've already made my peace with it for the most part.

I bonded with some of the people on the unit, I felt great for some & my heart broke for others who’s day didn’t go great and their plans have to change.

I am grateful that the drugs didn’t give me any adverse reactions or bad side effects, so far, touch wood.

I’m thankful for the Chemotherapy nurses and the Sisters who have worked short staffed and tirelessly. They broke their backs to make sure all the patients were happy & comfortable & seen to as quickly as possible when needed. They are true hero’s, even working hours and hours overtime so that we patients didn’t suffer as they were understaffed to begin with!


Things I will carry forward to next time are:

Wear comfier clothes, leggings just aren’t comfy enough and not warm enough.

Take some slippers or at the very least some very warm, cozy slipper socks.

Take a blankey, it’s a little something extra to feel more at home & warm in a very clinical setting.

More snacks, the steroids made me ravenous, I would of liked to have had a few of my favourites.

I would like to get to know some of the other patients a bit better next time, everyone seems to be so friendly and lovely!!

I am happy to report today that my dog's cancer did not spread! They think they got all of the malignant tumor with the surgery and now we just have to keep an eye out for future bumps.

&#x200B;

My mom is on the mend after having a PICC line installed and being on heavy antibiotics this month. My parents have bought their new house and have moved in!

&#x200B;

As for my brother's baby - they are still doing testing, but we are confident we can handle whatever the outcome is.

&#x200B;

And last, but not least, my baby boy with Leukemia. This kid is such a trooper. His strength truly inspires me every day. He is doing so well with treatment. We are close to the end of front-line (\~1 year) and we are slated move into Long Term Maintenance in November (\~2 additional years).

&#x200B;

**I wanted to give a special thanks to this community for letting me vent without judgement and keeping me grounded in a difficult situation. I'm sending love to you all and hoping we all get a little bit of good news to report.**",2019-08-31 00:46:48

The CT scan that was supposed to be a post operative, cancer free baseline for the five years of followup appointments I'm supposed to be starting now.

The doctors were so confident they got everything. The main tumour, in my rectum, and the solitary spot on my liver. 

But it's spread to my lungs. ""Innumerable spots"". It's back on my liver in two spots. 

I'm going to die from cancer and I can't bring myself to tell anyone anything yet, because I don't know what to even say, and I can't handle their fear and sadness on top of my own.",2019-07-27 08:06:39

More recently there was the mosque shooting and now they have me.

The professionalism, compassion and understanding from everyone has softened the blow to knowing I have terminal cancer. I start palliative chemo on Friday, PICC line was inserted today and the education from all was phenomenal.  They have made us feel welcome and go out of their way to help. I no longer see the hospital as a place of pain and sorrow but if love and compassion from amazing people.

It's made all the better as I see doctors and nurses genuinely enjoying working with each other and putting myself and my wife at ease.  Dare I say it's almost fun, and I love sharing jokes with them.

663,I’m tired.,83,b0ovul,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/b0ovul/im_tired/,6,1552527862.0,"Hi. I’ve posted here before several times. My tumor’s been growing since November and I’ve been an even worse nervous wreck than usual ever since. 

Life updates (in stream of consciousness [?] form):

- I just had another MRI on Monday that I don’t know the results of. 
- I’ll likely be able to do another 10-15 doses of radiation, according to Dr. Gardner.
- I’ve had nightmares about my tumor spreading to my brain stem. I start to dissociate and/or feel sick every time I walk into a hospital, see/hear anything associated with an MRI machine, or think about calling my doctors/getting a phone call from them. I very recently started using CBD oil and that helps with the anxiety some. I think I might have PTSD.
- My New York visits are now every six weeks. 
- I desperately want to have surgery at some point. I want more time. I NEED more time.
- I’ve got a new therapist. I see him again tomorrow.
- My mom’s looking for a better job. 
- I applied for and got SSI in less than 2 weeks. 
- I received a dream from my local Dream Factory chapter that just got fulfilled. I’m turning 19 later this month (March), so it had to happen before now. I got a shopping spree to redo my bedroom because I’ve never had a nice, beautiful bedroom w/new furniture. We could never afford it. My stepdad is helping me put the furniture together now. 

I’m in hell, but I’m lucky enough to still be here, so that counts for something. Thank you, r/cancer, and good afternoon.",2019-03-14 01:44:22
664,I have Lynch syndrome (HNPCC) and terminal cancer. I'm 35.,82,aedbrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/aedbrq/i_have_lynch_syndrome_hnpcc_and_terminal_cancer/,26,1547108614.0,"Don't really know why I'm posting this, I suppose it's cathartic to talk about it!

Just over 2 years ago I was diagnosed with bowel cancer, had a subtotal colectomy and now live with an ileostomy. I originally had my small intestine rejoined to my remaining bowel so I didn't have to have the ileostomy but the rejoin failed which led to me getting sepsis and nearly dying a couple of times. Found out a year ago that the cancer had spread to my peritoneum and that it was incurable. I've been having chemo for a year and start my 4th cycle tomorrow. The chemo is doing a fairly good job of controlling the cancer right now so I can't complain too much.

Having lynch syndrome gives me an 80% chance of getting certain cancers, just a shame I was the first in my family to be tested for it! My mother and aunty have recently tested positive for lynch syndrome too.

Anyways, life can be shit but I'll try and make the most of whatever time I have left. Hope this wasn't too long and depressing!",2019-01-10 08:23:34

I cannot begin to express how terrified I am. If/when my tumor starts growing, I’m most likely going to die. I have a few more options before I have to call it quits, but I am literally going to be clawing for every month until they come up with a cure/more effective treatment or I die. I’m so fucking scared. Like, I already had an anxiety disorder before I was diagnosed, but it’s been so much worse the past few weeks. I really don’t know what I’m going to do if it’s done anything. Have a full mental breakdown in the doctor’s office? Most likely. I cry almost every day because I’m just not ready to go. I’m not ready to leave my family and my best friend (she’s at Princeton for college). I’m just not ready. I’m 18, for fuck’s sake. Did I really deserve this?

I still can't believe it. He just came back from his chemo and I went to check up on him and he was unresponsive. My life is a complete and utter mess. I'm trying to keep it together and balance school/work and my mom is just so broken. 

I miss him a lot and I had no idea this would happen to him. There weren't any signs. Just one minute he was fine and the next he was gone. He was very stubborn and refused to get treated until we forced him to get checked out. We only found out he had cancer six weeks ago and now he's dead. 

Sure, him and I had our differences, but I just can't believe it. I've been putting in my all these past six weeks and I barely get any sleep cause I was constantly taking care of him. I just turned 19 a few days ago and I can't help but be sad about not having him with me for the rest of my life. I just had a normal conversation with him and the next thing I know he's dead. I don't know what to do

For those who experienced something similar... how do you cope? Does it actually get easier? And i also just feel a little alone. I want to talk to people other than my family but I can't in conscience just text people I haven't talked to in awhile that my Dad is dead, it just feels selfish and I'd be putting a massive burden on whom I tell it to.

I guess I just couldn‘t bring myself to write it all out until we were through the woods... nonetheless you've all been a great help & comfort to me these past months.

My mum, my best friend, made it into remission again and I‘m so happy!

On 1st Aug she was diagnosed with T3N2M0 NSCLC Adenocarinoma in her right lung. They weren’t sure she’d make it as the the tumours were already 3.5cm and one was very close to her heart. Cue 6 weeks of radio & chemo to see if they could shrink the tumours away from her heart & ribs, to make it operable.

7th Jan she had 8 hours of surgery; a Lobectomy to remove 2/3 of her right lung & the affected lymph nodes. A complete success. She‘s been home a week now, and just got the great news from her chief surgeon & oncologist. They don’t want to see her for 3 months (unless something bad happens with her recovery). The pathology/histology results were all clear.

She‘s been so brave, and fought so hard, stayed positive & determined through the whole ordeal. She‘s been a champion.

This cancer was caused by the treatment from her last dance with the devil, 25 years ago (in 1993) she had stage 3 breast cancer, which, given the time, was treated with a radical mastectomy of her right breast followed by chemo & extreme radiotherapy. The radiotherapy they used back then was too strong, and her lung cancer was directly below the treatment point of her breast cancer. I was just a child when she had breast cancer, so I wasn’t privy to the details until I got copies of her old files for the doctors this time ‘round.

I‘m so happy that tears are rolling down my face, and for the first time in 6 months I feel like I can breathe again. This all started 2 days after my husband & I returned from our honeymoon, so the last year has been a crazy rollercoaster... he has been such a great support through all of this, I don’t know what I would have done without him by my side.

We still have a long road to go recovering from the surgery, and training up her lungs to get the oxygen she needs to live a normal life again, plus strength & appetite as she’s down to 43kg, but I know we‘ll make it. Mum: 2, Cancer: 0.

I‘m sending all of you warriors & caregivers all my strength, fight on - fight strong.

I can’t even be angry or sad, since she was in a lot of pain these last few weeks. I’m only glad that it all happened around the holidays since otherwise I wouldn’t have been able to take care of her like I did.

She was a fighter until the very end and although the doctors said it would be a miracle if she survives until Christmas, she did it on her own terms and went away after it passed. She was so strong in fact that she waited for me and my sister to go see her in the morning. Once we were there, she left us in about 2-3 minutes. I don’t know anyone who is as strong as she is.

To everyone fighting - stay strong, keep moving, eat healthily and bring in as much joy in your life as you can.

To everyone caring for a loved one - stay strong, don’t get too mad at them and don’t forget to treat yourself.

Peace and love to you all!

I love you, mom! You’ll finally get the rest you deserved! I hope I was a good son.

My husband was diagnosed stage IIIc colon cancer on August 5, 2010 at the age of 38. We thought (and were told) he had it beat after surgery and 6 months of chemotherapy. However, on April 30, 2012, we learned that his cancer had metastasized to his liver and, due to its location, was inoperable. He was on several different chemotherapies and had radiation. He had every possible, miserable side effect. In January of this year he started a promising clinical trial. By May, it was clear that this treatment was not having any effect on his tumors, which were now also in his lungs. My husband decided he had had enough treatment. He felt he no longer had a quality of life that made additional treatments worth it. He held his own for a couple months, but in August, he started declining very quickly. He started in-home hospice care on August 14th. The nurse told us at that time that she thought he might have another month. She hit the nail on the head. Along with his brother, I watched my husband take his last breath at 2:17pm on September 14th; exactly one month after starting hospice care. He was 42 years old.

We had only a short 9 years together, 3 of those years as a married couple.

I (26f) just got diagnosed with (at least stage 3, possibly stage 4 depending on my bone marrow biopsy this Wednesday) diffuse large B cell non Hodgkin’s lymphoma. It’s been almost 2 months from my initial appointment to my pcp to my official diagnosis and honestly things have gone down hill quick. My cancer is a very aggressive type, which I suppose is a double edge sword, because with this blood cancer the more aggressive kind respond better to chemo then slow progressing ones. When my diagnosis journey first started, I went running 3 miles the morning of my first ultrasound. Now I feel like I can hardly function doing day to day chores without feeling completely sick and run down. It’s so scary to feel yourself go down hill, especially so fast. I was never the one to be sick, I’ve always been active and taken care of myself, so both physically and mentally this downfall has been difficult. That being said I am tentatively planned to start chemo this Friday! I know chemo is no cakewalk but neither is this. Chemo is pain with purpose. I just want to start feeling better soon.

Sorry for the long post

Like the title says he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer on January 29th after experiencing a series of symptoms starting around new year. Early symptoms were vomiting, struggling to eat, he described a feeling of a blockage and pain to the back and abdominal area. Over the first few weeks of the year they tried enemas, laxatives and managing the vomiting. That was until they finally got round to doing scans and saw a growth on the pancreas. 

We went to the hospital on the 29th not knowing what they would say. My dad was in alot of pain that day. The meeting with the doctor still feels like yesterday. I remember my dad asking if it was terminal but the doctor just replied with how he doesn't like that word and how something can be done for everyone. Anyway my dad was admitted to the hospital for a couple of weeks so they could get him stable and eating again. 

He seemed close to normal in the hospital after a day or so and was like that until he came home. This is where I started to look after him. What I got to see at this point is how bad he would get throughout the night. The medication he was on only seemed to work until around 2 in the morning. Then the pain seemed to go upto 11. He would cry out in pain and want a hot water bottle. One at first but we had to get a second as it wasn't enough. Now a quick warning. I dont know if it was the cancer or the pain killers but my dad would put them under his back and they would burn him without us knowing. That was until one day i checked his back and it was brown and patterned. 

Over the time i looked after him the pain became worse and so did his symptoms. I would say the key changes were becoming less interested in food again, sleeping throughout most of the day, easily confused, nodding off during doing tasks and becoming weaker and weaker. That was until he took bad one night and was sick bile for the first time. The day after he was admitted into hospital again as he was very confused and in pain. He had too much calcium in the blood and a stomach blockage. 

He was in hospital for around a week as they levelled out his blood levels and sorted out the blockage. He was alright enough to discharge again on the Wednesday but that day would be the last day he would eat. 

He was home for 3 days before he started to vomit bile and he was screaming in pain. So on the Sunday morning an ambulance came and he wad admitted into hospital for the last time. This time the doctors just thought it was a gallbladder infection. Talked about getting my dad better and discharge him. Oh yeah he still had months left they told us. So the doctors got my dad stable again but he wasnt eating and pain was still a problem.

Over the next few weeks the weight just fell off my dad and he couldn't even be awake some days when I visited. Other days he would be very angry and grumpy. Then one day he fell in the shower and the next he was in the hospice. 

First couple of days he seemed okay. We chatted when he could. Then again on Wednesday he took ill and was sick more bile. It was the first time he looked like he was dying. He was stick thin and i could see his heart beat through his t shirt moving. 

The hospice thought it was a blockage in the stomach or gallbladder and tried to fix it. They also tried to put a tube down my dads nose into his stomach but since he had a broken nose a few years ago, they couldn't. That was the last day my dad was fully aware. They put him on a morphine drip and that was it until the Sunday. 

He was responsive until the weekend. Even if you could only get a few words of conversation for the entire visit. I got the dreaded phone call last Monday morning, the 2nd of April. By the time i got there he had just gone. 

I know going through cancer is not easy for anyone. I did all i could but i still regret getting frustrated at my dad when he was grumpy. I felt bad on the days where i needed to get out for a bit for my own sake and leaving him. But remember that cancer changes all that it touches, even if we are just the ones left caring or picking up the pieces. Do whatever you need to do to get through it. There is no textbook on how so dont be afraid to ask for help like i may have been. Trust your gut, doctors can be wrong about how long is left so just take each day as it comes. Lastly, if your loved ones personality does change, remember that they still love you and that the cancer is just causing them alot of pain, confusion and is a massive hit to mental health anyway. This is evident as even though my dad was grumpy or sleeping when I saw him, when others visited he told them to look after me after hes gone. Remember that it will pass. It felt like forever going through it but now this year has flown over. 

Thank you for reading this. It was alot longer than I thought it would be. But it feels good to get it off my chest. ",2018-04-10 19:40:41

Had surgery, chemo, all the stuff . She was mostly fine until June 2020 where it was detected that the cancer had quickly progressed to Stage IV. She's on palliative care now and honestly I feel the end is near. She's on morphine, has lost 25 kg in three months, is basically skin and bones and her legs are extremely swollen and she can't stand well. Mostly is sedated all day because she has panic attacks when awake. I know she is probably going to go soon but I don't want to see her in such distress. She's on antidepressants but they help little. She's also having tremors and has difficulty breathing despite having good oxygen saturation (98%). I think most of it is anxiety related but don't know how to help at all. She likes games so when she's lucid we talk about games and about our cat (who she adores) and also pray (she's turned back religious and despite being an atheist, I do believe it brings her comfort so I don't mind) but don't know how to help her more. Any suggestion would be appreciated. 

PD: I also worry for my mom, she's a doctor and she has been her main caretaker and today she looked so broken. Of course I feel extremely sad too but I worry it would be too much for my mom to bear. She already lost her mom and her older sis to cancer (her sis even had same type of cancer).",2020-10-09 05:01:51

Diagnosed last May with triple-negative metaplastic breast cancer (57f). Went through 4 months of infusion chemotherapy, a mastectomy, six weeks of daily radiation treatments, and now I’m halfway through the final treatment, a 6-month regimen of chemo in pill form. Radiation burns healed, hair grown back and really starting to plan for and think in terms of my imminent return to normal life. And then ... 

Found out this week that the cancer has probably metastasized to my lung. PET scan and biopsy next week to verify, but my oncologist is fairly certain. And so the whole hateful circus begins again, only this time with much lower expectations, as this type of cancer has proven to be aggressive and chemo-resistant, and for a variety of reasons, surgery is not an option this time around. My doctor is already talking about clinical trials and “innovative” therapies, which I take as a bad sign.

Trying to stay positive and not feel sorry for myself, but I’m just so sad and disappointed and so PISSED! I knew there was a fairly high likelihood of recurrence, but I just thought I would have more time, some time to be normal again. It was so close...

I know I’m only one of thousands, probably millions, of people hearing the same news and facing the same prospects right at this very moment. I know I will have to re-evaluate and redefine and redirect attitudes and energies in order to live my best life through whatever comes next. For the most part, I think I’ll be able to do that.

At first we were all upbeat and confident that he was going to beat it. But about 2 months ago that all changed.

Forgive me for not knowing the technical term, but he developed a blood clot of some sort due to his chemo port. That’s when the Dr’s all conferred and told us there was really nothing they could do at this point, besides pain management. 

We prayed and prayed, and hoped for a miracle. But that miracle didn’t come. It’s been almost 2 years of slowly losing hope, and realizing that we were all powerless in a hopeless situation. 

So this week I flew home and am spending my days by his bed side, having normal conversations with him about sports, trucks, even plumbing... and he’s all there. He’s a bit loopy from the meds, but he’s there. 

It sucks. Because I know he won’t be there soon. Like at all. And I don’t know how to process the pain. It’s painful to wait. It’s painful to know what’s coming. And it’s painful to think of what it’s going to be like when he’s gone. What am I going to tell my kids when their grandpa isn’t here anymore? I’m lost in my emotions.",2020-02-29 13:51:44

I have been fighting this for three years but for the last year treatment has just been palliative.  Even when I'm not on chemo I feel myself fading slowly. And there is absolutely no one that I can talk to about it.  

I have been the cheerful cancer warrior all this time but I just can't keep it up.  When I am sad, or frustrated or anything less than merry sunshine my family avoids me.  I know that it isn't malicious, they just aren't coping.  But what it means is I get the silent treatment from my husband and kids when I'm unhappy.  And I have talked to him about this *repeatedly*, but only after I cheer up again because that's what it takes to get him to speak to me.  

My closest friend can be good for some dark humor but a few weeks ago when my husband was avoiding me I texted her and she said she didn't want to get caught in the middle of us.  The two of them were already texting about me but neither would speak to me.  So I've had to revise my expectations from ""best friend"" to ""mutual friend"". 

My extended family has distanced themself since the terminal diagnosis. 

I am depressed, obviously and understandably.  I am on an antidepressant for nerve pain and it helps a little.  Cannabis oil (legal stuff) has really become a crutch because it's the only thing that keeps me smiling (and relieves other symptoms).  Yes I have had therapy, for me personally in my situation it just made me feel worse.

So here I am, on a tropical Christmas holiday that will certainly be my last, with 6 genuinely miserable humans that I love more than anything and no access to the medication that makes life bearable. And today was a bad day.  It should have been a good day, I had more strength and stamina than I have in quite a while.  But it was a bad day and I'm just really sad.  And I did not fly halfway around the world just to eat Costco pizza.

I've been on chemo until last week when I finished (yay), and I've just started on tamoxifen. My daughter (26) lives 90 mins drive from me. I drove to see her to break the news to her. I feel sad since then she hasn't been to visit once. She has a car, and disposable income, and she doesnt work weekends. I have a guest room all ready for her. 

I feel envious when  I read posts from people whose parents have cancer, and they've quit jobs or school to move back to be close to them.

I have felt very alone throughout chemo. Im divorced, and I only moved here a few months before diagnosis so I hadn't yet made friends, and I haven't been able to get work because of being sick. I have had no one to help: no helpful casseroles, no one to run  a vacuum around the place. I focus on the positives, and seeing a therapist helped a lot. But I have felt very alone and unsupported.

I drove down to visit my daughter three times this year, but driving the distance was hard with the nausea and aches and pains from my medications, and with no income I feel apprehensive about the gas costs for the trip. I couldn't afford to get a motel/hotel overnight so I had to drive there and back in one day, which wasn't ideal.

 I wish so much my daughter would have come up to visit me. No,  I wish she'd *wanted* to visit me. Until now I thought we had a normal, close, loving, functional relationship. We text every couple of days, about shit on reddit, or what's in the news, or something cool she saw in a store. Now I feel I have to reevaluate everything. She's just starting her adult life, so it's normal her focus is on her boyfriend and her career. But when I read posts from other redditors I feel sad we don't have the closeness I thought we did. I'm not sure how I could have been a better mom to have made my daughter want to see me, and I dont feel like I have the physical or emotional energy right now to address this with her.

(I have worked for this small business so I know the owner personally. And when I say small business, I mean small. The town we live in has a population of over a little of 500 people)

He then went on to say what had happened. She couldn’t remember anything. Their names, how to work the till, computer, etc. After our phone call ended I immediately left to drive where she worked. -I only lived about 20 minutes from here-
After I left I called the nurse hotline and told the gal her symptoms. She told me that I should call 911, because the symptoms I gave her basically said that she had a stroke/seizure. 

When I arrived at my moms work place she snapped out of what she called an “episode”

My boss and I asked her if she would, please, go to the hospital and get checked out. She reluctantly agreed.

We made our way to a Mayo Clinic. I’ll spare some boring details, but I left, came back and saw my mom in tears with the nurse beside her.

I can’t think well. Just need some support 


About a month ago, my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. He also has diabetes, his kidneys are working only 20-30 percent, and has heart problems. 

Because of the corona situation, dad was discharged from the hospital without any warning. We received no help, no medical assistance, no help to transport him to doctor visits absolutely nothing. Dad is the only financial breadwinner of family so we are running out of money too. 

But it didn’t matter. I was happy to see dad again, but everytime I saw him in pain, every time I saw him struggling to breathe, I felt like a part of me was dying too. When I was sick, when I was scared, I ran to my dad for comfort. Every night before I went to sleep, I always hugged and kissed my parents even if others made fun of me. I’m 26 and I have no shame showing my parents love. Because they are my greatest blessings in life. Now, the person I love the most is in so much pain, and there’s nothing I, a useless daughter can do. 

Dad went back to the emergency room on Friday night as his sugar level was extremely low and it wasn’t going back up. He needed blood which we also didn’t realize. And every day his condition is getting worse. Every night I am so scared to sleep because I’m so afraid to wake up the night day and hear dad isn’t there anymore

My happiest memory, my happiest moment was being my dad’s daughter. If I were to be reborn, I want to be his daughter again. I can’t explain how much I love my dad. Even when he was sick, he was trying to pay off my student loan, even at his most painful moment, he was thinking of me

It would have been better if it was me who was sick. I would gladly give my life if it meant that my dad could live 20 more years. They say that a parent should never have to bury their child but their kids shouldn’t also have to bury their parents even if it’s a natural process of life.

The time I have left with my dad is short and the pain in my heart feels like it will burst my heart open. 

I can’t even see my dad because my immune system is compromised and my dad doesn’t want me to be sick. I’m such a useless daughter, I couldn’t even graduate on time

I wanted my dad to see my get my diploma, I wanted him to be the first person to know I got my first job, I wanted to hug and kiss him before going to sleep even at the age of 30, I wanted him to walk me down the aisle when I get married

My dad is dying and so is a part of me.",2020-03-23 07:24:19

It is becoming very apparent that my Dad is nearing the end of his short battle with cancer. I don’t know how much time he has left, weeks maybe at the most. It hurts my heart to know that he won’t be around much longer.  

His health has been in decline for awhile. Decreased mobility, incontinence issues, muscle weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss. He started needing to use a catheter to go to the bathroom in October 2019. Two days after this past Christmas he was admitted to the hospital with the flu. He spent a week in the hospital then came home for a couple days, but it was very clear he wasn’t getting better. He was admitted back to the hospital for infection and they did a CT scan and found the tumor. It was a 7cm tumor in his bladder. This was early January, just over a month ago. 

He was released to a rehab facility to get himself stronger to be eligible for surgery and chemo. We had such hope that he could build up some strength. His doctors and oncologist kept giving us hope that he would get better if he could just eat more, or just do a little more PT. But week after week, he keeps declining. 

He’s lost over 30 lbs since Christmas. He barely eats anymore, maybe a couple bites of each meal. He says that he’s simply not hungry. For awhile we tried to force him, but we have come to realize it’s no use. His body is shutting down.  

He is pretty much bedridden. He can still get himself out of bed, into a wheelchair and into a recliner, so he has some bit of strength left. But I have to remind myself that less than two months ago he was able to walk himself into the hospital. He’s also started sleeping more this past week. 

My mom is his main caregiver and she is absolutely devastated and overwhelmed and full of grief. It is so hard watching them both go through this. I’m also struggling myself because I am 7 months pregnant and really sad that my Dad will probably not be around to meet his granddaughter. The thought of death and birth occurring around the same time is so incredibly bittersweet. My emotions are all over the place.

739,PSA: Cancer has a mental health toll and you should treat that too,81,e9udpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/e9udpj/psa_cancer_has_a_mental_health_toll_and_you/,21,1576216873.0,"**tl;dr -** *cancer has a mental health and emotional toll, no matter where you are in treatment.  And it also can have a physical (brain chemistry) toll.  All of these factors can lead to, among other issues, depression.  And you should do something about that too.*

I finally went to see my PCP about some depression issues and I'm just really glad I did.  I already feel a weight lifted off my shoulders.  

**For background:**  It's been just about 5 years since I was DXed with stage 4 melanoma.  At the time, immunotherapy was (quite literally) reaching breakthrough status and would be approved for use in stage 4 patients.  When I was first diagnosed and knowing all those stats, I really felt I was going to die.  But, even after a year of unclean scans and then a recurrence 2 years ago, I have been very fortunate to be NED for just about 2 years now.  And rest assured, I am very happy and thankful.

But for the past almost year, I've just been feeling down.  Somewhere between blue and just really, really low.  Easily irritable.  Just so incredibly guilty (for a number of things, but including survival).  Unhappy and sometimes numb.  I didn't have any self-harm thoughts (I'm really happy to survive).  And finally, my wife spent the last 3 months or so urging me to do something about it.  

So finally, I called my PCP yesterday (yesterday!) after a particularly rough week and asked for an appointment and honestly, it was easy.  I spent the rest of yesterday just writing down all the things I was feeling and what they felt like and then explained them to him.  No judgment from him, just honesty. 

He stated that, among other things, it was possible that the possibly years of cancer-induced stress and crisis might have negatively impacted my brain chemistry.  And never mind the fact that it could be other physiological factors but also the pretty significant trauma of cancer itself (and probably confronting my own mortality).  

We discussed options and decided on both drug and therapist treatments as a means to figure it out.  I'm working through all that stuff now.  I should have done this way earlier.

And if it's not the same cancer, then all the radiation causes some new cancer 10 years down the line. There is no Hallmark movie going on here. 

And people, they ask, ""are you in remission?"" And I think: maybe; maybe not. How would I know today? I'm not willing to commit to anything because things can change... just like that and I'm just trying to get through today, thank you very much. 

But, you know, what people want to hear is: you're in remission!, God loved you best! Your life is *better*, that's right, even *better* than it was before and cancer has made you a better, *stronger* person! You're a warrior! And a survivor! You inspire them! 

I ran into my former veterinarian while trying to quickly shop at Wally World last week. He said I looked great! Asked if I was in remission. When I said I wasn't ready to commit to this (*because I had literally just left the oncologists office where he gave me a long speech about how yearly PET scans don't change the outcome they just make you go on chemo regimens sooner and you still die anyway in the end, so why not have a nicer quality of life for 5 years?*) he informed me I would outlive him and argued with me about why I was surely in remission.

745,The worst experience since diagnosis wasn’t from the cancer; it was the medicine,83,b4t8w5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/b4t8w5/the_worst_experience_since_diagnosis_wasnt_from/,40,1553436986.0,"Last year, while taking chemo, I had some constipation issues with an anti-nausea drug called ondansetron. The doctor gave me another anti-nausea called compazine. 

I started to experience the worst feeling I have ever had. I couldn’t sit still enough to get sleep at night. I would walk around my room late into the night debating whether or not to wake my mom from the couch in my apartment. I would spend hours crying to her telling her how awful I felt. But I could never pinpoint what was wrong. The anxiety and restlessness came to a degree that I had never experienced. Existing felt torturous. I wish I was exaggerating. 

I remember once when I went out to dinner with my mom and sister. The sun was shining and we were sitting outside. I was excited to get out of the house because of this feeling of restlessness. But the second we sat down I felt trapped and restricted and cried to my family that we needed to leave. 

I was seeing a counselor already for an issue related to my anxiety, so I feared that this was an amplification of my preexisting anxiety. I went to my counselor to discuss anxiety medication, so she referred me to her colleague, a psychiatrist. While she was checking the drugs that I was taking she came across a side effect from compazine: akathisia. The second that I stopped taking compazine, the symptoms were gone. 

So I thought I’d pass on some of my chemo wisdom: Trust yourself! You know when something is really wrong. Tell your doctor about any abnormal feeling or side effect.
I felt like the restlessness was too trivial of a thing to mention to my oncologist because it was mental health, and seemingly unrelated to my treatment of cancer. I also am very grateful that that psychiatrist was able to diagnose the issue so quickly. It felt like she was an angel. If you are going through chemo, consider seeing a counselor. Mental health is just as important as physical health.

746,"Difficult situation, would appreciate help from those also with incurable cancers",79,apat9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/apat9v/difficult_situation_would_appreciate_help_from/,47,1549876156.0,"Hey. So I've posted here a few times before. General gist is I got diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer a couple months ago, aged 23. It's in my lungs and it's pretty bad. Right from the start they said that it was incurable and that I'd be getting treatment for the rest of my life. I started on a round of chemo (which was light and thus did not impact my life much at all) but a recent CT scan shows that this chemo has had little effect. There is an option of massive surgery but my surgeon only wants to do that if my life suddenly becomes at risk, it wouldn't be healing me, it'd be keeping me alive and since it'd be so intense they only want to do it if its absolutely necessary. 

So. My difficult situation. My doctors said that I could try a further round of chemo, but this would be the intense, hair-removing, highly destructive stuff that would impact my quality of life a lot. My doctor also said that this last-ditch chemo option had a less than 10% chance of actually working. It might just make my last few months extremely horrible with no reward. My other option is to do nothing and simply enjoy what time I have left, with my doctors working to alleviate pressure from symptoms. I'm currently doing pretty good so far, you wouldn't even think I'd caught a cold this past year.

I am aware that this is the sort of situation where this is no right answer. There's simply picking the option that is best for you. But I really don't know. I want to live more than anything. But chemo is terrifying, and I hate being sick, I just want to be unconscious when I don't feel good, and I wouldn't ever finish chemo and go back to my old life. It'd just be accepting being very ill as a stage of life before I die. And that's if it works. It's more likely that it won't work and I'll just add more misery onto my life before I die. But I say that and I still want to do it because I don't want to die even though I'm gonna hate life the whole time. The option of doing nothing is something I am considering, because I know I can't cheat an early death, but I find the thought of just sitting there and not doing anything to combat the illness inside me extremely difficult. I genuinely would try doing essential oils or something just as a little sanity-restoring thing if I went with that option. So far with my treatment I've been... holidaying, essentially, I've been seeing friends and watching a lot of tv and spending time with my family. I've really enjoyed this break from adult life in a weird way. I don't want to give that freedom up for chemo. I read a blog from a woman in her thirties who was diagnosed with incurable cancer, fought it with chemo a bit and got a few more years that way but eventually called it quits. The fact that she tried makes me feel like I have to try. I feel like there's this pressure on me to fight (everyone everywhere tells you to fight cancer and that's great and all but I already lost my fight guys) and it goes against a lot to just say, no, I'm not doing that. 

My one vague compromise is to do nothing, enjoy what time I have left, and when I get hospitalised or ill enough that I can't enjoy my life as I did before, then I try the chemo. Because at that point I won't be getting better no matter what I do. I kind of feel like I'm just being a coward though. Too scared to consent to the chemo that realistically will not work. But truthfully, the kind of life that a cancer patient lives - going through chemo with limited strength and no hair and a hundred horrible side-effects from treatment - I don't want to live like that. Idk. I know there isn't really a question here but it's just a bit sad. I would really appreciate hearing from others in my position or from those who are familiar with this sort of situation. The classic cancer story is ""I had this disease and I fought it and I won/lost"" there isn't really any discussion around people who have already lost. 

Edit: I guess, and this is me just being vaguely curious, what would you do if you were in my position? ",2019-02-11 09:09:16

Actually, more than a year ago. May 4, 2017. 

In September 2015, she was diagnosed with Stage IV adenocarcinoma, a 7-centimeter tumor in her left lung and small specks of cancer in her right. She was only given eight months to live. 

By God’s grace, genetically she was a candidate for a clinical trial drug called Tarceva that stabilized the cancer for many months. We had all hoped the drug would shrink the tumor, but it only stopped it for a while. “Stable is a positive in our world,” the oncologist had said. 

In summer 2016, Tarceva stopped working and she began traditional chemotherapy. We were back on our eight-month timeline. I was at many of her infusions.

But there is no cure for Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Treatments only give you more time.

Mom had time to go on one last trip with each of her kids. My two sisters went to Mexico with her. My brother to Colorado. And I, at the final hour, in February 2017, went with her to San Francisco and Yosemite.

I was there with mom at the hospital for many of the downturns. When she had her needle biopsy and they staged the cancer and mom found out it was going to kill her. When Tarceva didn’t shrink but only stabilized the tumor. When the oncologist said all the treatment options had failed and the best chance for quality of life in the time she had left was to go home into hospice care and let cancer go.

I asked him how much time she had. He said, “Weeks to months.” If you’re counting, that’s two to eight weeks.

Mom lasted six.

I remember the first day she was home in hospice. One of her girl friends come over to visit. Mom talked with her for an hour, going on about this and that. I sat in a room off to the side listening to her talk, not the words, just the sound of her talking, and it was so pleasant remembering all the times as a kid growing up and listening to her talk on the phone with her friends.

She lost a lot of weight. She made it to her sixtieth birthday. In the end, she was a breathing skeleton. She started hallucinating. And in the last two weeks, she became less and less responsive. She spent her last three days sitting in a padded recliner with her arms folded on a desk in front of her and her head down. I think it was the only position that opened up her chest cavity to allow her to get enough Oxygen. 

An hour before her death, her breathing changed to a series of brief sniffs.

A minute before she died, I heard the sniffs catching in the back of her throat, and I knew the air wasn’t getting to her lungs. I told the rest of the family, “This is it.”

The five of us were there. I held her two hands in front. My brother was on her right. My sister was on her left. My dad and my other sister huddled over her further to the left. It was hard to tell when she took her last breath, but at some point, one of my sisters said, “I think she’s gone.”

When she died, everyone cried out loud; I remember specifically my dad and my brother, though.

But I didn’t. I went for a walk around the lake and my legs buckled beneath me every few steps.

I loved my mom.

All the people who knew and loved my family, some knew better than others, that there’s a sadness among our family that’s deeper than death and cancer. And the hurt is this: Decades of not-talked-about hurt and coldness and distance and missed conversations and lost time between my dad and mom. Loss of husband-wife warmth and relationship, all lived out under one roof but never reconciled. It was the bigger tragedy.

I was sitting beside my mom, just us two, when the oncologist told her it was time to go home into hospice. Dad came in and mom told him. I remember he audibly choked back a sob, then he kissed her on the forehead, choked back another sob, and kissed her on the forehead again.

After all the years of him keeping his emotions inside a fortress, I was shocked, *shocked* to see him cry.

I wish none of this had ever happened. I wish mom and dad had loved each other and been truly happy. I wish mom had never gotten cancer. I wish she hadn’t died. It never had to end this way.",2018-05-23 20:25:48

She was in hospice for a month, choosing to have care at home and discontinue the Avastin regimen, along with the new addition of Opdivo.  

The former was no longer effective against the grade iv glioblastoma, based on renewed growth from two mri scans.  As for the Opdivo, she couldn't tolerate the side effects.

The last week marked noticeable change in her physical & mental states.  On Sunday, she stopped her maintenance medications (comfort drugs excepted).  Wednesday, she stopped eating and drinking.  Thursday was the last time she spoke.  Friday, she stared off into space, still aware by virtue of squeezing my hand on command.

Saturday was a continuation of Friday until mid-afternoon, when she was breathing rapidly and had a pulse of 145.  That ceased at 7:04, when she gave shallow gasps, and eventually stopped. 

She is finally at peace.  Me?  I'm working on it.  Reading about the progression of the disease is no match for seeing first hand with a loved one.

&nbsp;

I believe that when he was diagnosed it was already too late, his cancer had gone untreated for very long and the tumor had actually burst, which is why he had a fever. But we didn't know this back then. 

&nbsp;

He had surgery immediately after the diagnosis in April, but they couldn't get everything out. He went back home with my mom 3 weeks later and wasn't really careful enough and ate whatever he wanted, he had a bowel obstruction a couple of weeks later. 

&nbsp;

He was taken to a bigger hospital in June and had emergency surgery for the bowel obstruction. The main surgeon told us how bad it actually was and that he really thought he wasn't going to make it through the surgery. He was given 6 months to live in June. 

&nbsp;

This was awful to process, I don't live with my parents, I live and work in a different country so I couldn't just go see them whenever. But I was able to take two weeks off work from July 20 until July 31. HR was understanding. 

&nbsp;

He was put on a lot of painkillers after the second surgery, the recovery process was delicate but he was discharged and allowed to go into hospice at home on July 9 which was the only thing he wanted.

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, the painkillers he was prescribed for the home hospice weren't nearly as strong as the ones he was administered inside the hospital unit, nor was the administration as effective.

&nbsp;

He developed an infection during his home stay and his health declined very quickly. He was taken back to the first clinic in order to receive palliative/end-of-life care on July 14.

&nbsp;

It was finally time for me to take time off work and travel to go see him on Monday July 20. It was a long trip and I went to the clinic directly.

&nbsp;

My mom walked me to his room, I'll never forget the number N°206. When she opened the door I entered the room but my first reaction was to turn back because I thought my mom had made a mistake and I had walked into the wrong room.

&nbsp;

She looked at me wondering what I was doing, I looked back at her and all I could whisper was ""Is that him?"", ""Yes dear, that's him"", she said.

&nbsp;

I broke down like a literal child, I couldn't breathe, talk or even cry properly for a whole minute. He was barely conscious, his eyes were closed, he was pale and full of bruises, he was extremely skinny but the tumors had taken over his abdominal area. He could barely breathe through his wide open mouth. His face looked nothing like him, he was malnourished because he couldn't eat. I did not recognize my dad. He had no life left in him.

&nbsp;

But, somehow, when I called his name and said it was me he mustered up enough strength to open his eyes and lightly smile as if he was telling me that he heard me and that he was happy to see me. I told him I loved him, I thanked him for everything he has done for me and I promised him I was going to be strong for myself and for my mom.

&nbsp;

I told him it was okay if he wanted to rest, I told him it was okay to let go. He was heavily sedated on both a strong benzodiapezine and morphine, so I don't know if he actually processed or remembered anything. But I like to believe so.

&nbsp;

Me and my mom went back home and I cried my eyes out until I went to bed. My mother has surprisingly been handling the whole thing very well. I was the one who was a mess.

&nbsp;

The next morning, on Tuesday, my mom got a call at 11:45am. My dad passed away peacefully and without pain on Tuesday, July 21 2020 at 11:40am. The doctors say he waited until I got there to let go. I hope it's true. I am still very sad.

I’m breaking down, I am 19 years old and I have metastatic Ewing sarcoma, which is an awful cancer to deal with. In front of my family I have remained strong for so long but today I woke up and broke down. The idea of death scares me, not dying, but seeing all my friends and family before I go. Seeing the faces of all them not knowing what to say to me to possibly comfort me, I love them all so much. That’s my biggest fear, knowing my two sisters and brother are losing their youngest sibling. It’s not supposed to work like that. I pray that if I go my mother, father, and all my siblings find the strength to keep going, I do not know if I believe in the cliche of “I will always be with you” because what if I’m not allowed to be. I hate the pain, I hate the words that come from the doctors, I hate this horrific disease, and I hate feeling like nothing. Today I’m in a lot of pain, and the pain turns my mind into a dark place. Recently I started talking to a girl, the worst part is, this girl matches my personality to a T. Sometimes it’s like I’m talking to myself, I may be young, but I have talked to a lot of different girls (I don’t mean for that to come off sounding like a prick).
We’ve spent nights with eachother and it has only been a month, I wasn’t ever expecting this while going through treatment, and it just pulls at my heart strings even more. Everyday, I hope and pray that treatment works and one day I’ll live cancer free. As a reminder on days like this, I always tell myself of the times I have died during this two year journey, and how many times I picked myself right back up and did not let it defeat me.

It’s been ... not great for the past weeks. Biopsy came back and my oncologist was spot on: myxoid liposarcoma, stage IV, already tiny bits in the spinal connectivity tissue (not the proper spine?).

It’s been a few days. Diagnosis was delayed because trying to get the radiation mapping done took forever because it hurt the absolute living shit out of me. Finally, I had to refuse treatment again, and the radiologist said we should focus on other avenues of treatment.

Only thing that makes me mad is that we had a clear plan on breaking out the pain meds to get me to the end, like planned to the minute, and none of the radiology team followed through. This was Friday evening, so haven’t had a chance to talk to them about it, but do you all think it’s something to pursue?

Also now have a really big cavity in the back of my thigh, near to where my tumor was/is, oozing lots of blood, not bleeding out, just oozing. They’re keeping it stuffed with gauze right now. Needs to be changed at least twice a day; doesn’t *hurt*, but is rather unpleasant. And also prevents me from continuing my chemo. So now that’s sitting in the back of my head and pit of my stomach.

Emotionally, I think I’m doing OK. Need to make some plans, want to visit with extended family and old friends, but stupid dumb virus is screwing that up. One thing I want to do is setup something for my two nieces, no idea what it would look like, but a couple of presents or something in the mail every year, birthday and Christmas? Don’t know if there’s something like that on the Internet.

By the time my doctors could find out what as going on, it had already exited my thigh and ""landed"" in my spinal column. One part in particular, the L5, was enlarged enough to seem to block at least some of the treatment, so my doctors tried to focus on shrinking that tumor in particular to alleviate the massive amount of pain I have experienced. My doctors' have determined that shrinking the L5 via radiation is not the best path to go on, and will be meeting on Monday to determine a better way.

Also I have already done two rounds of chemo, one on ATM, the latest on trabectedine. Three more I think? Latest plan was to continue on with the trabectedine, but that might have changed.

At the same time, in the back upper part of my thigh, a cavity developed that won’t embolize. So far, the only way to stop the bleed has been to wipe out the cavity, then stuff it with kerlix gauze and the put in a few sutures or tape to hold it together.

I know that I probably don’t have a lot of time, and I need to start making plans for visiting family and friends for the last time, right? But I can’t do that with this thigh thing hanging over me. So, what can I do?

I appreciate i have never posted in here, however reading a lot of posts helped me deal with what my Mum went through before she passed away.

My Mum passed away last night, after having lung cancer for 4 years. She was given 2 years by the doctors so she fought it pretty damn hard. Every moment with her was treasured, and even though we knew it was coming, it's still a bit of a shock.

  My cousin, who like I said in the title was like a brother to me. He was 42. Hodgkins disease gripped him at 10. He fought it and beat it into a remission. 28 years later he developed esophageal cancer directly related to the radiation treatments from years earlier. After having his esophagus removed he rebounded and went into remission. Flash forward to middle of last year and doctors found tumors on his spine. Tumors were removed and a new round of treatments were prescribed. After 8 months the cancer spread throughout his body. 2 weeks ago he was hospitalized with 1.5 pints of fluid around his heart. Emergency surgery removed the fluid but the damage was done. Last Sunday his heart failed and he lost his 3rd and final battle with the beast.
  Not 5 days later my best friend who is battling stage 4 liver and colon cancer sits in intensive care in the same exact bed my cousin died in less than a week before. Today I tried to go up and see him. As the doors opened to the ICU wing I saw his room with the isolation protocol sign on the door. Everything hit me at once like a freight train and I lost control of my emotions. I turned around and walked out of the hospital a broken man. I did not want him to see me upset at all because I didnt want to darken any cloud of hope he still clings to.
  About 3 hours after I couldnt take myself into my buddies room I received a call from his father. He was gone.
  6 days and my loved ones lives and my life have been torn apart from the motherfucker known as cancer. I hate you! You are a selfish prick who does not care whose life it damages and takes.
  I am completely broken right now, but you wont beat me. I have the best memories of both individuals that I will take to my grave. Finally to my friends, I miss you both.

It was soul crushing but she fought. 
 Chemo was every other week for a year and half, then surgery to remove the right lobe of her liver, still she fought it. After the surgery we finally got good news, it seemed that the main tumor had shrunk away and the lung biopsy had come back as a negative, we celebrated. 

The week before our 3 year anniversary she said she didn't feel good, so more tests. We got the call on our 3rd anniversary that it had come back and spread, it was larger in her lungs and now had spread into her lymph nodes. That was 6 months ago. For the better part of 3 years she has had chemos, surgery's, and scans, almost every week. 

Today she wants to give up. I hate it, I hate that through all of this where she has fought so hard that her resolve had broken. I hate that nothing we do seems to work. I hate that I have said so many things and we have talked about so much of our future and now it may not happen. I hate that I didn't do things sooner, we were together for 8 years before we got married. I hate that I didn't see the signs of all of this sooner, I hate that I'm not helping anymore. But over everything else, I hate myself the most. All I can think about is how this is effecting me, how will I deal with it and I yelled at her today because of it, in over 10 years of dating and marriage have never raised my voice at her in anger until today, until she gave io and I hate myself for it and now she hates me and there is nothing I can do to take it back.

I guess I'll start with a [few pics](https://imgur.com/a/U67Aw)

And some now that I'm [looking almost normal!](https://imgur.com/a/RloXM)

Ok so I'm a bit new here! And I've been lurking reddit hard for years. I'll start off with a brief synopsis of my story. 

About 6 months ago I was having severe ""migraines"" (read orange sized tumor pushing on my brain). I was in and out of the doctor, no CT or MRI. I also started exhibiting vertigo, nausea and vomiting. My neurosurgeon informed me these were basic identifiers for brain cancer. But doctors are people too and stuff gets missed, life goes on. 

On Tuesday the 26th around 7 p.m. I was walking my dog, got severe ""vertigo"" and fell to my left side. A guy helped me up onto a tree and I was able to text my girlfriend for help. We went to the ER immediately. Within about an hour (after a quick CT scan! Then MRI) I was being shown the MRI and told I most likely had a Stage IV Glioblastoma and needed to have brain surgery. As you can see in the MRI it is located in the left hemisphere and was actually pushing on my left side which is why I fell that way.

On Friday September 29th I was in surgery for about 5 hours. The resection went very well, there is no ""curing"" this cancer, it is created by the glue in my brain. Hopefully they can learn something from me. They put in 8 chemotherapy wafers in the newly created hole in my brain that will hopefully help kill off some of the leftover ""nasty bits"" as we call them.

Post-Op is going well. I'm gaming, cubing, working a little (programming), moving around more, and trying to find projects to take on to keep busy. Overall I feel very positive that I'll get through this first year and we will go from there. I am very lucky to have a very strong family and support system, they have truly made this bearable. 

Anyways, just wanted to introduce myself! I'm sure I'll need all the support I can get! I wonder if there's a Glioblastoma/Brain Cancer group or club out there?

(I do have 2 brain surgery pics if you guys want to see them)

Last Christmas my mom was complaining of pain in her midsection that kept growing worse. An ER visit said it was probably muscle pain, gave her a lidocaine patch, and referred her to her GP. He ran some bloodwork and concurred he thought it was muscle pain. 

It came back in January. Another ER trip. Some scans showed something in the liver, so she was referred to my dad's oncologist (dad is as close to being in remission from esophageal cancer as possible) who began to run tests. Nothing conclusive. More scans. More bloodwork. DNA testing on the biopsy. They found a mass in her liver, spots on her lungs and stomach. 

DNA tests inconclusive. Eventually she was diagnosed with stage 4 neuroendocrine cancer that had spread to her liver, lungs, and stomach. She got started on chemo, but didn't react to it well. Exhausted all the time, not just the few days after treatment. Couldn't eat anything, no appetite, constant coughing and vomiting up what little she managed to eat. Her doctor suggested immunotherapy instead, and after a long battle with the insurance company she was able to begin receiving that.

She also received brachytherapy to reduce the size of the liver mass. It did, a bit, but didn't really relieve her symptoms at all. 

I live in a different country from my parents, so last week my husband and I went for a long-planned visit. My mom landed in hospital the day before we got there, so we spent much of the visit in hospital hanging out with her. She was in extreme pain due to a tumour in her spine pressing on the nerves and bone, and the oncology team suggested radiation therapy to reduce the size of it and give her some relief. But she didn't want to do that because it hurt too much to be on the rad table. She was on IV morphine and hydrocodone, but when they offered to up her medication she refused--part of it is that her brother died of a self-induced opioid overdose about 15 years ago, and the other part is that she's growing increasingly paranoid.

She's afraid the nurses are trying to ""get rid of her,"" she's afraid the doctors are trying to off her, even when the Eucharistic minister from church visited it was ""he makes me feel like I'm on my way out."" She won't talk to me or my dad, and only briefly to a social worker--saying she's afraid, basically. 

But the thing is, she's declining so quickly that it feels like she is ""on her way out,"" in her phrasing. My dad thinks there's a distinct possibility she won't see Christmas/New Year's. She had to be catheterized the other day because she is having trouble passing urine. My dad desperately wants her to be home, but my mom is almost reluctant to come home. She'll need a hospital bed at home, and my mom is afraid she'll be a burden. 

My husband and I are back at home in our country, and it's killing me each day. I'm just waiting for the call that say she doesn't have much time left, and to come quick. My dad spoke to my husband about it, but not to me, because our family is definitely a This Is Hard, Let's Not Talk About It family. I'm genuinely running distracted, my mind is totally elsewhere, and this is just crushing. 

Thanks for reading. I don't have any friends who have gone through this before, or who have even lost a parent, so they don't really understand. My husband is right here in the thick of it with me, and we're all struggling together.",2019-10-21 21:06:20

It doesn't help that people my age are usually busy with their lives (career/socialising) , I can't join them for the usual outings anymore (eating out, bars, physical activities, normal 25 yo stuff etc) because I'm still having treatment. Its been months since I've seen anyone in person. 

They use to check in and hang out with me after the first few sessions but as time went on I notice they didnt even bother asking anymore, maybe because I always told them I was fine after the first few chemo sessions so they kinda assumed Im still fine now?

But it still kinda hurts that nobody bothers to drop by/check in anymore, worst thing is I know everyone still hangs out with each other occasionally just without me (they're open about it so its not behind my back). I'd have mixed feelings if they threw me a party for completing my treatments because I can't shake this feeling of abandonment. 

Am I just overthinking this, can't help feeling Im being selfish :/

Just to have him tell me that one of my Oncology Surgeons phoned him the night before to say I didn't need Radiation on my ass as I am fully resectable now at 4 rounds of chemo. 

I was to do one more chemo (5 in total skipping the 6th) and then get ready to be ridden by a stallion on the operating table. I don't even begrudge them the 400-mile round trip and the tourist priced hotel room I had to get. At least we found free parking.

I keep telling myself my butt will stretch 8 inches and a raccoon only needs 4 inches to get up there (thanks for that knowledge Reddit). So if I have any ass raccoons they can get them too.

Then I went and saw my Case Manager today and they are going to pass on the 5th chemo and get me ready for surgery. The chemo drug that starts with the letter ""O"" that everyone hates has raised some of my liver levels. So they are not doing the 5th chemo and I am getting ready for surgery in two weeks.

I am bullshit my Iceland trip has to be canceled. But on the plus side, my odds of living has improved substantially from 3 months ago.

Of course there could still be a couple cells or whatever but nothing big enough to see. That means I still have to finish the 4 planned chemo cycles and my radiotherapy but it's encouraging to know that cause if there's nothing visible right now so there probably won't be even a single cell left after all the chemo and radio so it probably won't come back. 

37 days ago I had a mass big enough to block my brain ventricle and now I have nothing, pretty cool how far medicine as come.

To anyone that is going thru or will go thru chemo and/or radio just remember that it's worth it even if it's not fun and you could be healthy in less time than you may think !

Overall I am happy that it's gone but I already kinda knew since my mass was giving me double vision and the double vision was gone for a couple weeks so I figured it was working but it's still nice to know for sure !

They are reducing the dosage on my chemo because of the side effects.  I said no I don't want to but they ""have to"" because it's protocol.  So I'm fucking dying but managing diarrhea is more important?

I am planning some travel and need to coordinate with my treatment but my doctor doesn't really want me to because something might happen.  Something WORSE than fucking dying?

My mom passed away today after a long, painful fight with cervical cancer. I was with her this fall quarter as I had taken this quarter off from college to become her caretaker. After she passed, I cried a little when I saw my relatives were also crying. I was also crying because I regretted not being at the hospital by her side when she was passing. I regretted not telling her I loved her when she was still conscious and able to think. I said goodbye to her when she was unconscious but it pained me because I wanted to know that she knew what I said. Like I know hearing is the last senses to go, but did she really know that I really, really loved her? I wanted to go after work (night) and stay by her side overnight but she was gone so fast. But now, I can't really cry. The drive home, no tears came. When I was working, no tears came. I think I just feel numb but I don't know why. I feel like my brain hasn't really processed it but rather it is trying to not thinking about it.

Because my mom passed, I'll resume college this winter quarter. However, I'm scared about how I will ""react"" or ""feel"". Would i be crying all of a sudden? Would my focus be totally diminished because of this event?

I've never experienced a loss of a loved one and of the most important person. She was a single mother who raised my siblings and I, so she was the only person that had supported and loved me my whole entire life. It hurts me when she was alive and asked the doctor to do whatever they can so she can at least see me graduate. Now she can't, and she won't be able to see my future children or watch me get married.  I'm also afraid of losing the sound of her voice. What should I expect after her death? What can I do to take care of myself? I don't know if I'm allowed to ask those questions, but I'm totally lost right now. Thanks",2018-12-10 18:01:03

795,Update on my wife who had advanced bowel cancer at 34 years old,79,5ssd91,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/5ssd91/update_on_my_wife_who_had_advanced_bowel_cancer/,12,1486585082.0,"Hi all,

It has been a while since I was last on here. I think I posted at the beginning of my wifes diagnosis which was in June or just into July (2015). We have been through a massive journey and one which everything will probably now stay with me until the day I die.

My late wife was first diagnosed with secondary bowel cancer after being misdiagnosed for three months and by the time the tests were done, it was too late. It was terminal (stage 4) and uncurable.

In the end she had cancer in her bowel, three quarters of her liver, light particles in her abdomen, both lungs and in her bones. She had pains in her hip for 2 to 3 months towards the end and our Dr said it was extremely rare that bowel cancer spreads to the bones and kept refusing to do any form of scan at the time. Well turns out it was the cancer and was on the brink of fracturing her hip as it had indeed spread through her bone structures (and even through chemo) that she had to rushed into hospital and have a hip replacement....at the age of 34!

A day and half later she was discharged from hospital and allowed to come home. No physio, just crutches to take home. Oh they did get bed heighteners installed in our home as well as toilet heighteners and a tall backed chair. And that's when it all just sped up. She had fluid fast growing in her stomach and legs and she was ballooned up so badly she looked like she was pregnant. I was told she had Ascites in her liver so that was no longer functioning. Every 2 to 3 days, in and out of hospital, drained, back at home to rest, then do it all again a few days later. In between was blood transfusions and it completely took it's toll in the end. The night before she passed away, they put a drain in to allow us to drain the fluid ourselves.

Well the next morning after the drain was put in, she started having chest pains and breathlessness and slowly started forgetting things and becoming more and more agitated. I phoned 911 to ask for help and eventually demanded an ambulance due to her condition worsening. When the paramedics arrived she closed her eyes and started screaming for people to help her and was like this throughout the rest of the day. I can still hear her screaming out. Almost haunting in a way. It was almost like my wife had dementia within 24 hours as she didn't know who anyone was, not even me, which is the most upsetting thing about it all.

I contacted as many people and allowed all of my wife's friends to come and pay their respects before she passed and think they all appreciated that and am sure she would have also.

She sadly died at around 11.14pm that night. She took her final few breaths of life and then...nothing. I was slumped over the hospital bed like a broken man and still am to an extent. I am now a widowed father of two children, both 8 and 10 years old at the age of 36. People say 'time is a great healer', 'it will get easier', 'I know how you are feeling'. Do you really? Honestly? This coming just 2 months after I was made redundant from my job after 8 and half years. How does someone pick themselves up after so much devastation and in such a small time frame?

It is now just over four months since the funeral and feels like it was just yesterday. I have good'ish days and some bad days. I walk out and about sometimes staring into the distance like i'm not even on this planet. I'm somewhere else. Sometimes I will just sit and look at where she used to sit or imagine she is just about to come in from work.

The day of the funeral for me was probably the hardest day I will ever encounter. Seeing the hearse pull up outside our family home with 'mummy' in the window made up of her favourite flowers and the very slow drive towards the crematorium.

I am now going through counseling after deciding enough is enough as my health was getting worse and worse from the stress and anxiety as I had pretty much gone from being her husband to just her carer. So much so, I thought I had bowel and stomach cancer as I became symptomatic but this has now all been cleared with tests etc. A massive weight from my mind but still on anxiety medication to help me get through the days ahead. Now my two young children, 8 and 10 years old are now going to go to counseling to get them through the pain. Although they appear to be fine, I'm sure they are holding it back for my sake.

I'm just so grateful I have such amazing family and friends who have all been so supportive and can't ever thank them enough.

I made a promise to my wife that I would continue and do the best for our children. The hardest thing was it being so close to Christmas and I had no interest at all which is unlike me as I usually love that time of the year, especially for the children. I did my up most to make it as special as I could for my two children. It was their first Christmas without their mummy. It was very difficult but being around our family really helped the three of us through the pain.

We have since scattered her ashes across a few of her favourite places including Paphos Harbour where we got married just over 12 years ago and was lovely to finish our journey together as that is where our journey together began.

If there is any good out of all of this, my wife is no longer suffering and in pain and is now resting in peace wherever that is. Sleep tight sweetheart.

For every person and their loved ones who are going through a cancer related illness...stay strong, think positively and make each day truly count. Thanks for listening.",2017-02-08 20:18:02

They did a scan last night and they said no tumor growth, and that she was looking good.  Now her body is failing.  Jesus Christ, I didn't think it would happen so fast.  Why was I at work.  I should have been home.  I just started the job two months ago, I should have just stayed home.  I'm only 22 why do I have to lose my mom so quick.  I can't believe this is happening.  I'm sorry this is incoherent.  I need to just yell into the wind on the internet.  I joined this sub a year and a half ago when she was diagnosed.  I thought I'd have more time.  I can't believe this.

Edit: Thank you all for your kind words.  When I got here at the hospital, she was and still is totally out of it.  She has been for the past day.  Sometimes she opens her eyes and has the horrible look on her face.  I don't know if it's just all the pain killers, but it looks like utter fear.  It hurts so much.  I was hoping she'd be somewhat of mind, but she's out of it.  Doctors say this is the end.  It's just time now.  I can't believe this is happening.  I wish I saw her more.  I wish I never took the job.  I wish there was more time.  I want to cry so hard but I'm so tired of crying.  I could just pass out.  Again, thank you for your kind words, I would try to respond to all of you individually, but I'm just so tired and want to be with mom even if she doesn't know I'm here.  I would kill to know that she knows it.  Like I said she's opened her eyes, but I don't know if there's anyone behind those eyes.  I just want to hear her say ""I love you"" once more.  Jesus why is this happening

Edit 2:  It's 10:30pm local time, 11:30 my body's time.  Mom is still with us for now, but she's pretty much all gone mentally.  There's no room in the hospital for the whole family, so me and my brother are going home to my parents house to sleep while my dad and my mom's sister stay the night.  There was a moment where she had her eyes open and I told her I love her, and she kinda sighed out two ""syllables"" which kinda sounded like ""I love..."" before closing her eyes (she hasn't opened them since).  I don't know if she actually was trying to say ""I love you too,"" but telling myself she did helps me a lot.  I will be back tomorrow morning.  I really hope she doesn't pass while everyone is asleep.  I don't know if anyone is reading this anymore, but thank you if you are.  I'm basically using this Reddit post as a diary at this point.  I'll continue updating tomorrow.  For now I need to try to sleep.

Edit 3:  5:55 AM, May 24, 2019, my mother passed away.  I wasn't at the hospital.  I was asleep.  My dad was there though, and so was my mom's sister.  Dad said she went very peacefully.  I'm not ready for this.  My dad just came back and he's just in a whole different state right now.  No one knew that when they left to take her to the hospital for some minor pain that she'd never come home again.  Jesus Christ.  I think I'll probably keep updating this over the next few days.  It's helpful for me.  Hopefully someone reads all this.  I just can't believe it's over.  Just can't believe this.  I can't.  My god, she's gone.",2019-05-24 02:28:41

At first, we cling to one another in the desperate hope that being around those whose footsteps we blindly stumble in might somehow lessen the gravity of the burden we each carry so confusedly.

Lucy was a beacon.

No one was prepared for the journey, and all we can do is look to those travelling with us for some guidance, clinging to those rare and remarkable individuals who somehow illuminate the darkness with their own light.

But, like a lotus from the mud, something new and beautiful can grow; weaving its way unwaveringly and unapologetically skywards.  With love, patience and perseverance, our collective trauma (whilst still awful) can give life to the truly extrordianary.

Lucy was a gardener.

She planted the seed on October 16th 2018, bringing together a handful of people, myself included, in a Whatsapp group. Carving out a space online, she created somewhere within which we could be entirely vulnerable and upfront about the challenges we were facing as young cancer patients.

She tended to our seedling with a determination and commitment rarely witnessed in this vast and confusing thing we call existence, and it not only survived; it flourished.

More and more names were added to our circle, each bringing with them new insights and new struggles. Our daily conversations traversed the fathomless lows and mountainous highs of our individual lives; from the heartbreaking to the hilarious. Some even met in person, sharing these moments with the rest of us who looked longingly and lovingly on from behind our screens. Our lotus bloomed.

Lucy was a fighter.

I don’t mean just for animal rights nor conservation – about which she was fiercely passionate. I mean that, despite battling her own lymphoma cancer, which had first reared its ugly head in March 2018 and continued to bewilder and enrage us all with its reoccurrence, Lucy never faltered in her support for others.

Whether from a hospital bed, hooked up to any number of medications in that moment, or from her own home, curled up in her PJs and in beloved canine company, you always knew she would be there with words of encouragement, a sassy meme or simply to listen as you cried.

Lucy passed away last night.

Lucy,  you touched all of our lives in more ways than I can count. You brought light to the darkest of times. You made us smile when we feared we would never smile again. You shared your deepest truths with us, and in turn gave us the courage to share our own. You showed us love, and it was returned ten fold by each of us who were so glad that we had met you. We love you.

Lucy was a badass babe.

My love for you is a life force, driving my every motivation, my every move. Our souls forever bound to one another. If we could recreate this life as different people, I am still convinced you and I would end up together. I didn’t know a love as deep as this was possible. Its as if the only way we can truly know love is by knowing suffering; deep immeasurable suffering. I wouldn’t change anything about our lives. You are my destiny. I want you to be happy. Honor my memory in the best way you know how, by doing unto others and carrying on the message of love, hope and courage, but do not sacrifice your happiness. If you can help *nephew* and *niece* to have a chance at a good life, invest in them. Their success would be the best way to honor my memory. Never give up the fight for social justice and never become complacent with the way things are. Vigilance is the price we pay for freedom and we should never take that for granted. I love you so very, very much.
 

Your wife,

I miss the feeling of being able sing more than the sound of it. I used to be able to stand on a stage and sing so loud that I didn't need a mic in performances. I could feel it in every fiber of my being. Every nerve ending would wake up and sing with me. 

Ever since my first surgery, it was never the same as I went 8 months with no voice at all. Now, I can barely raise my voice in a crowded room. I can feel the stir sometimes, in my gut, that wishes I could still sing. However, I have tried...and it just doesn't work. When I ask my doctors, we scope my vocal cords, they look the same.... and the docs just kind of laugh and say ""well lets just be thankful you can still talk!"". Of course this is now 6 surgeries later from the first one.

I am very thankful to talk, but I would love to be able to sing to you instead. <3

I'm okay. Just a moment of mourning. <3 to all, I'm here with you!

&#x200B;

So, a few weeks ago my now 36 year old wife was diagnosed with stage 4 uterine cancer. It’s been a hard fight. We were already in the hospital when the diagnosed finally came through. We started off in a losing position and just didn’t know it yet. I am still her by her side, but we can’t even talk anymore other than a groggy eye blink here and there.

Our story starts long before this though. We’ve come to this realization during the long thoughts of why. April of last year she was hospitalized for anemia. She experienced heavy bleeding for a month, maybe more. She was given two units of blood as they thought that would stop the bleeding. And it did. She liked the doctor so much she continued to see her as her OYBG after the hospital stay. My wife ended up on birth control to control her hormones. And that was it.

And that was it. After talking about it over and over with friends, family, and friends of family, the best I’ve heard was that was a missed opportunity. She was very young, only 33 at the time, but had a couple of risk factors. Other than the heavy bleeding, though that alone maybe should have prompted a cancer screening. But it didn’t. It wasn’t even in our heads to force this issue or even bring it up.

Earlier this year she began complaining about back pain. Nothing too major. Around of April it began to hurt so much it was debilitating and she had pain in her front as well. It seemed like a UTI to her, she tried to self-treat a few days, but was quickly at her doctor’s office. They listed to her UTI concerns and gave her meds and sent her way. We ended up in the ER that weekend. Saw a nurse practitioner and tried to explain the past month of pain. My wife mentioned out the UTI symptoms seemed to be better maybe but her pain was getting worse. The NP focused on that asked her why was she in the ER if she was feeling better. Her conclusion was my wife fell or hurt herself without knowing. Even after she insisted that something felt wrong and was wondering if they could just scan something. They sent her home with muscle relaxers and ordered physical therapy. They did a culture for the UTI though, came back negative because there wasn’t one. I like to think of this as another missed opportunity.

She followed up the ER visit with her regular doctor, still seeking a scan or something, because this was wrong. He had no problem sending her to get one. Week later we were going over the results and she had an enlarged uterus. A follow up appointment was made with her OYBG. She was also sent for a CT scan, which at first she skipped because she at this time felt too weak. The pain was hard for her to deal with; everything they gave her did nothing. She also began experiencing extreme nausea and no longer had any appetite. She couldn’t get comfortable enough to sleep either and spent the nights pacing hoping the paid would subside enough so she could sit back down. Her OYBG took a biopsy and told her to go ahead and do the CT scan just in case. The follow up, no results. The biopsy had to be sent to another clinic for further testing. She had done the CT scan though and compared to the one they did when she was hospitalized in April. It looked bad. Her uterus was 10cm last year, now sitting at 24cm. She was referred to an Oncologist. April 24th was the first time Caner was said. She wasn’t diagnosed with it, but was seeing an Oncologist next.

We never made it to the Oncologist appointment. April 28th, just before midnight we went to the ER again. Pain, nausea, sleeplessness always getting worse. She was quickly admitted with acute kidney failure. They were barely working at all. It is possible the contrast they used for the CT scan compromised already struggling kidneys. Not great, but we were in the hospital now and dialysis was going to help.

The hospital was aware of all the other issues going on and added all the doctors who were already working on her case, including the Oncologist who stopped by the next day. He went over everything and referred to the growth or the mass frequently. In the end he said it had spread a little bit and the outcome did not look very good. We were still not full grasping what these words meant. This could have been the first time they could for given the heads up for stage 4 cancer. No he wanted to do a lymph node biopsy first. The first biopsy results still haven’t come back, I’m not sure it ever did. After three days they said the new biopsy was hard to diagnose. They said this could indicate it was rare. It? You could tell they wanted the results before the called it Cancer. They brought on another Oncologist who really wanted to start Chemo. The tumor was too large to operate and would put all of the surrounding organs at risk. But they need to know what to treat.

May 3rd, still awaiting results, she was having trouble breathing her blood pressure was getting low. They were adjusted medications trying to get a handle on it. Nothing worked awhile her blood pressure kept dropping. In the afternoon it got so bad she got moved to intensive care. Her breathing was very labored by now. They found a large blood clot in her lungs. The clot was pressing on her heart. They had found some in her legs earlier so she was already on blood thinners. She needed aggressive treatment now. They wanted to give her TPA. They problem was of course if her tumors were bleeding the treatment could cause her to bleed out. The doctor suggested a half dose and cross our figures. Bleeding risk was still there but also it might not work well enough. We gave her the medicine and crossed our figures. Doctor said it would be quick, and in 15 minutes my wife was able to breathe again and heart rate came down.  A day later she was out of the danger zone of bleeding out. Clots just don’t go away. Thank take time.

She was weak after that day. We were focused on getting her to eat, exercises to get her out of bed, and working her lungs so they don’t fail. We got our diagnosis. Endometrial adenocarcinoma. It wasn’t rare at all. It was hard to diagnose because it was aggressive and non-differentiating. So good news, we know what it was. Couldn’t start chemo with the way her vitals were. They wanted her out of the ICU. It took a week, but we were finally out May 10th. They still wanted to wait on Chemo; her hemoglobin levels were too low. Good news was they were going up every day. We had a goal and knew what was next. May 14th the day before her birthday she was told we could start Chemotherapy the next day. It had its risks and side effects. Did not help her kidneys still have not made a comeback. But the doctors could work around that. We were ready.

May 15th 4am she becomes non responsive. Over the next hour her heart stops five times. They have to put her on a respirator. Her mom got there quick. During the 5th cardiac arrest the doctor was telling this this was really bad and she was going to come back. We agreed that if she had another we would let her go. And like that she stabilized. The CPR team did great work they got the medicine in her that she needed. And she was stable, sedated with a breathing tube. They had her rest for the day. The blood clot in her lungs was making it hard for her to breathe deeply. There was concern over this, but she had treatments, exercises, and was on Oxygen. But the CO2 levels in her built up and turned her blood acidic, resulting in heart failure.

She has been critical, but stable ever sense. The day after they lowered her sedation to make sure she was still responsive. She was quick to look around, recognize voices, and give some hand squeezes if she wasn’t too tired. So I know she is still there. The doctors say that is good and bad. She is aware of what’s going on as we have to make decisions for her. And these decisions are hard. The oncologist doesn’t think she will recover enough to get chemo. The Pulmonary doctor says the breathing tube can’t come out because she can’t breathe deeply. Some doctors give us a little hope here and there. But they might just be being nice. Other doctors telling us that there is no chance and the sooner we stop treatment the better it is for her. And every day we wait gets worse and worse. That cancer is still in there destroying what it can.

Finally today we meet with the doctor that helped us get through the first blood clot. She was the best then and explaining everything. We had been hoping to hear from her again. She gathered us all up and sat down with us to explain the whole picture to us. Give us every bit of information and stitch it into place. So we can see just how sick she has become. What kind of life she could expect if we followed various paths. She spent a lot of time with us answering all our questions about why we couldn’t hope on one thing or another. She related with us on a personal level. She did point out that things happen and they could be proven wrong, but with all the information she saw and gave us. We won’t be moving passed where we are now. She was very good at explaining what happens if we want to focus on quality of life as well. We have a very good understanding on what next. She left us to talk and figure it out without any rush or hurry. It’s our decision to make when we are ready.

Part of this story I left out are all the people. Her mother, sister, father, step-mother, aunts and uncles.  An amazing amount of friends and coworkers. Each one of them remind me of how well loved she is.

815,Well... that was unexpected (from Austria to the hospital),74,9d805b,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/9d805b/well_that_was_unexpected_from_austria_to_the/,10,1536192474.0,"Hey everyone. So I was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma 5 months ago and I kinda feel like telling the story of how I found out I had cancer.

So, I’m in my senior year of high school, and HEAVILY involved in my school’s music program. I was a participant in the 3 choirs offered there, as a vocalist, arranger, and accompanist. In the past, I was in band and jazz band, both of which I had quit by the beginning of 12th grade in order to prepare for my auditions for a university music program.

Every 2 years, my high school music program goes to Europe. When I was in 10th grade, they went to Italy. I had planned to go, but I couldn’t due to the fact that my spinal surgery was scheduled to be RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE of the trip.

Flash forward 2 years, and we’re going to Austria for our music trip. There is NO WAY I’m not going on this. Austria is probably one of the most musically rich countries in the world.

About a week before I left for Austria, I got a bit sick with a cough and I noticed a pain in my side. The cough went away before the trip and the pain was manageable with Advil. My mom, who is a nurse, decided to let me go to Austria. We thought that, at worst, I had a costal condritis.

As much as I loved my trip in Europe (Munich in Germany, Salzburg and Vienna in Austria, and Prague in The Czech Republic - we performed, saw locations where The Sound Of Music was filmed, visited Mozart’s house, went to the salt mines in Salzburg, bought sheet music in Prague, and went to several musical performances), as it progressed, the pain in my side began to worsen. My side was swelling up and little spider veins began to trace my body. Once the pain became so unbearable that I was unable to sleep, I called my mom back in Canada. This was two days before the end of the trip. We decided that if the pain persisted, I would see a doctor in Prague. My mom also set up an appointment with my doctor back home for the day after I returned from Europe.

The next morning, I felt better, so I decided to wait to visit a doctor when I got home. But as the day progressed, my pain worsened.

The day we flew back was the worst day.  I was in excruciating pain the entire time and when I finally got home, I took a shower and went to bed.

The next day, my mom checked me out and noticed a painless lump on my back. A tumour. I didn’t know it at the time, but my mom did.

I went to see the doctor, who then sent me to get an xray. The xray revealed that I had fluid in my lungs (3.5 litres to be exact) and I was sent to the hospital.

A week later I was diagnosed with stage 4 rhabdo, an unusual cancer for someone my age (it usually appears in young children, more rarely it occurs in the oldest ages, being 18/19).

One day I was in Europe, walking around, singing, taking in the beautiful architecture, the next, I was in the hospital.

My friends called this “reverse WebMD”, since I thought what I had was a LOT milder than what I actually had.

And here I am 5 months later. I’m doing really well. My tumours have shrunk to the point where if someone who didn’t know my situation looked at my scans, they’d think they were normal.

Anyways, that’s my story. Feel free to leave yours below. :)",2018-09-06 00:07:54

Look, I don't know what lies ahead for me. I was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer at the end of February this year after a bout of nightmarish stomach pain. I'm 28 years old. Asian. Gay. Male. 

Just let me whine, please. I'll be ok after. I'm not even the type to complain, really. Life gave me lemons from the very beginning--not just recently. I can ask why me over and over, but, in the end, who am I compared to everyone else? I'm not special. Just another ant delivering food to its colony. The better question is, why not me?

Sometimes I wonder if I'm being tested. That some omnipotent being is looking down on me, placing obstacles in my path, and just waiting with bated breath for me to crack. I won't crack though. The cancer will have to fight me until my very last breath. Until my body becomes etched with reminders of my condition. Until my breath becomes labored with exhaustion. Until my eyes become too heavy to open. I will not surrender. 

My life has tempered me like a sword. It wasn't easy being gay growing up. In fact, I tried to kill myself at the ripe age of 11 after a period of despondency from feeling rejected at school and at home. There was no way out at the time, it seemed, and euphoric fantasies of death lingered in my head. It felt less like jumping into something scary, and more like stepping into something warm and welcoming. 

Nothing happened, of course, and I never attempted again. Although passive thoughts have crossed my mind, I've made no plans though, so don't worry. Like I said, I'm a fighter now. 

There's a good chance I won't be around in five years. I know that statistic well because I think about it almost everyday. I suppose I'm supposed to be fine with ambiguity and uncertainty. Don't you know? It says so in the cancer handbook that we all get. I'm relying on my oncologist to know what he's doing. So far so good. The latest scan shows improvement. But. What about the next scan? And the next? They don't tell you about the uncertainty and the ambiguity when they diagnose you. 

Until then, I'll pretend like everything's fine when people ask me how I'm doing. I don't want them to carry any burden as they go back to their cancer-free lives.

When I say 'cancer' people think about a disease so vile, sneaky, unpredictable and persistent that it can only be killed, if at all, by poisoning yourself to the brink of death and somehow managing to survive. But luckily that is not what cancer is like for many of us. Not meeting this severe image of cancer can cause us to feel like a fraud. We are relieved, but may find our issues dismissed (e.g. from surgery or ""easy"" treatment or living without an organ or facing the idea of death when all our peers are at top health). And those around us are also relieved, but do not have a frame for understanding what we are going through. This can lead to harmful stereotypes. A lot of us may be abandoned by friends who cannot face us even though our situation is not that bad. Or we cannot get a mortgage even though we are much more likely to die of a traffic accident than of our cancer. This all may also impact how we relate to our own disease. We internalize the steteotype and have trouble letting the facts of our disease sink in. We may insist on getting more intense treatment and monitoring than our situation actually warrants. We worry about scans more than is is perhaps necessary. We expect treatment to be more difficult than it is and ""nocebo"" (bad placebo) ourselves into experiencing negative side effects.

i suffer from depression. i’ve been off my meds for almost two months. obviously not helpful. i’m angry all the time and when i’m not angry, i’m crying. i’m angry she smoked for decades. i’m angry she still smokes. i’m angry i’ve been her main caretaker for over a year. i quit my job. i failed two semesters of college (one due to a hurricane/breakup/taking care of my mom combo, and the other from just taking care of her). my brothers are kept in the dark about her state because one is doing “so well” at his college that if he finds out, he’ll “fuck it up.” the other keeps fucking up and if he finds out, “he’ll spiral and do something stupid. again.” according to my mom.

so i get saddled with all the information. the caretaking. i’m angry about it. what about my mental health? i’m angry nobody helps. i’m angry my mom won’t let anybody else help. i’m angry that i feel so selfish. she won’t be here to see me or my brothers graduate college, get married, or have kids. she won’t be here for me to ask for advice. i won’t be able to take her on trips like i envisioned, once i had a career and the money for it. i’m saving all her texts, voicemails. i’m scared of her dying. she’s been the only constant in my life and now she’ll be gone.

she isn’t dead, but i feel like she died a while ago. she can’t remember anything. it’s hard to hold a conversation because she can’t connect her brain to her mouth. i translate what she means when we go places and she has to talk to a doctor or anybody else. sometimes she has good days. but lately it’s all been bad. i’ve barely seen her leave her room, much less the bed. i want my mom back. i want to stop being angry and sad.

its hard to find a place to cry. i cry alone in the car or when i’m working at the barn. i’m mad my boyfriend’s cousin has cancer, but all he has to do is take a pill once a day because of some genetic mutation? it’s not fair. i’m fucking distraught. i feel so alone. i need a giant field where i can just scream until my throat bleeds and nobody will hear.

i’ll probably delete this. i’m sorry. its almost midnight and i cant sleep from crying so much. i just needed to put this somewhere where i might be understood",2019-11-04 13:44:04
824,Life after cancer? How do YOU deal?,74,bzdudh,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/bzdudh/life_after_cancer_how_do_you_deal/,43,1560295447.0,"After all the chemo, radiation, surgery, and appointment after appointment, when they finally say “All is clear, you’re good to go!”

I was so happy to hear that. Excited to get my life back, to make it even better.  

I’m gonna be completely honest, there are times I miss it. My family was nicer to me, and even complete strangers.  Now that I have hair and I don’t look like I’m about to die of malnourishment, things are different. No more phone calls checking on me, no more strangers calling me a warrior, no one is running a race in my honor, no more pink ribbons. 

This is a different kind hard. I’m wondering how other survivors cope with life after cancer?

Edit: thanks to everyone that has shared their stories.  It’s been so helpful to peer into the lives of others.  You all have reminded me to never give up, to be more vocal about what I need from others, and that I’m not alone. ❤️",2019-06-11 23:24:07
825,A list of questions for an end of life interview.,75,bo9wzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/bo9wzt/a_list_of_questions_for_an_end_of_life_interview/,2,1557813565.0,"My 15 year old daughter planned and ran a video of me reading and answering questions about my life.  There were so many wonderful moments to this so I asked if I could post them here to help others and she's really pleased to help.

&#x200B;

These questions are personal to me, and as you read through them, the immature pop culture obsessed person I am.  I play drums in a band so I love my music.  I love monster movies and science fiction, cooking and eating.  Therefore, use these as a start then modify to make them more personal as not everyone will want to decide whether Godzilla is better or worse than Super 8, Alien, etc!  (I will not say what my pick is!)

&#x200B;

**The way this ran was as follows:**

1. Print the questions onto paper and then slice them up
2. Place them, folded into a hat, bowl or whatever else makes sense on a table next to where you feel comfortable making the video
3. Put the camera on a tripod, we used a phone as the camera is really good but that's up to personal choice.  Just make sure the lighting is OK!
4. Have the family there as you read and answer the questions.  Their responses are as much a part of this as your own
5. Take breaks if you need to as it can always be edited together later
6. Press the record button!
7. Start with asking what you are doing and in this case, my daughter said we are asking questions about my life so they have something permanent to remember me by.
8. Start by taking a question out of the hat, unfolding it, read the question and give your best answer.  Keep going until they are all gone
9. You will need tissues and a glass of water as at times it got very emotional - and that is wonderful.
10. Most importantly, enjoy it.  We did.

829,Coming up on the average life expectancy post-diagnosis and feeling terrified,73,97bexw,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/97bexw/coming_up_on_the_average_life_expectancy/,27,1534304103.0,"I found out I had an infiltrating brain tumor in my left thalamus in November 2017. When I had a biopsy, we found out it had the H3 K27M mutation. That puts it in the same class as DIPG— they’re all called “diffuse midline glioma” now. 

Average survival time for kids with DIPG is ~9 months. That’s the most common type of cancer in this class. They usually have very large tumors in the pons that respond well to radiation, shrink and lay dormant for a few months, then grow exponentially and uncontrollably. I’m five months post-radiation and two months off of maintenance chemo (clinical trial!)

I am so fucking scared. I know I already have a better shot because mine is theoretically resectable and has no blood vessel growth/mitotic features under a microscope, and it responded to treatment, I just... I’m 18. I haven’t seen ANYTHING or done half the things I want to do. Nobody wants to admit that I could die. I feel really fucking frustrated that very few people understand how serious this is. 

Also, I’m paranoid. Headache? Tumor grew and pressed against my third ventricle, causing hydrocephalus. Backache? Spread to my spinal cord. Nauseated? Also something wrong. 

I don’t feel like it’s fair to hold out hope for beating the odds when they are so firmly stacked against me. Goddamnit, I don’t want to hope and get it crushed and watch my mom suffer through losing a child. She’s my best friend and my biggest cheerleader. I don’t know if I would survive losing her. I don’t want her to have to lose me to cancer when that was a fear she had all throughout my childhood. I’m just so tired of being scared and of imagining the future.",2018-08-15 03:35:03
830,We lost him,75,8x275w,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/8x275w/we_lost_him/,32,1531092627.0,"On the 6th, my father passed away because of cancer. He showed absolutely no symptoms when he was diagnosed with Stage IV Colon and Liver cancer a few months ago. It was terrible watching him suffer, but I guess it is over now. I am having a really hard time accepting his fate. He was 49 when he died. I am his only son, and I am 20. My sister is a little younger than me. The first two days, I didn't feel upset at all. I felt fine. I was relieved that he wasn't in pain anymore, and felt that the end of his life was for the better since he wouldn't be suffering anymore. I am not sure why, but last night I fell apart. 

I miss him so much already. It really is the little things that get to you. I miss saying hello and goodbye to him. I miss hearing his voice, seeing him in his spot on the couch, just having him around. I thought I was at peace with his passing when I was in the hospital with him. He held off medication when he was admitted a few days before his death just to have one final conversation with me, and that conversation means more to me than I can explain. I am very fortunate to have had that real goodbye to him, and I know that. 

I am having a lot of trouble coping with it. I understand his death, but I don't like the uncertainty of the future. I'm not sure what the next month will be like, and that is really hard for me. I love him and am happy he is no longer suffering. It's what he wanted. No one should go through the pain he was in at the end. I wonder how long it will be before I fully adjust to the new reality. 

I am trying to make things as normal as possible. I can adapt to the changes like him not being around, as long as that is the only element that changed. If I take it as one challenge at a time, it is much easier for me to adjust. One problem is that family keeps visiting. They are not normally around, so adapting to my new home life is harder with all of these outside elements involved. I get that they are there because they care and all that, but it makes the grieving process more complicated when my house is full of people who don't usually go there. 

It's a hard time. However, it is my reality, and i have no choice but to overcome this. ",2018-07-08 23:30:27

My name is Jenny and I'm 18, I was a carer for my father though his 9 month cancer struggles. I pushed him into the doctors office and cried with him everyday. I held his hand as feel asleep and kissed his forehead for the last time. 

When you sign up to be a carer for a family member they tell you it won't be easy and they are right. Nothing is going to prepare you for what is about to unfold. 

At first I thought it wasn't to hard and I could handle it. Helping him move from his bed to wheelchair, pushing him around the house and to the doctor's them few times. 
Cutting up his food and using different plates incase he dropped them. It was a breeze, but it got harder. Before I knew it he couldn't walk and than he needed paper and pen to talk, I had to brush his teeth, whip him down for showers. 
But yet it was still nothing, I was become exhausted so fast form stuff so simple and I wish I reached out and I wish I wasn't afraid to say I needed more help. 

Dad being sick didn't just make me the carer for him, I now cooked, cleaned, shopped and did everything around the house for my brother's and I got frustrated with them for not helping but it wasn't right of me, they did what they could just like I should have been doing. 

One day was all it took for dad to stop being able to walk, one day and he could no longer stand, one day and he could no longer talk, one day and he could no longer use the toilet. 

Always be prepared. Always be a step ahead. 

My dad like many was stubborn and I had to push, I pushed him into that first doctors appointment and I pushed him to every meeting and every check up for as long as I could. But there was a time to stop where he begged to just stop.

As much as we want to help them we need to take a step back at times and listen, my dad never went to chemo and I'm glad I didn't push him into something he didn't want.  My dad stopped seeing a doctor and for a while it was okay. 

Know when to push and when to stay back. Don't always be at 100% because sometimes it's just not wroth it. 

My dad died at home, he died happy. 

Make the most of your time with them and always remember you are a daughter, son, child, partner, mother, father, ect before you are a career and they would always want to be your loved one. 


Take it slow, be prepared and always ask for help. There are people out there. 


Thank you for reading and please take care.",2020-08-26 14:38:20

In public, I would make jokes, laugh, anything to not show the vulnerability. If you’re not laughing, you’re crying. That’s what he taught me. He laughed a lot.

He was clever, quick, great at strategy games, and a little – lot – goofy. In our nearly half a decade together, he cried 3 times. That last time, it hurt me, the way he accepted his brain cancer. But he started laughing more after that, and I loved that. He would ask for lots of foods, to make me feel useful, I think.

He would ask how we were doing. He never complained. Never. He had a subtle charisma, charming. I couldn’t have asked for a better partner. Don’t think I’ll ever find one again.

At any rate, we need to take this time to be the best version of ourselves. I’m sorry for what you’re all going through, and I would give anything to stop it or take it myself. We’re in this together. And if we’re not laughing, we’re crying.

845,A question for those with incurable disease,74,dd3voc,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/dd3voc/a_question_for_those_with_incurable_disease/,29,1570201565.0,"Sorry to be blunt but how do you feel about the fact you’re going to die? 

So many groups I’m a part of on the internet desperately scramble to avoid the elephant in the room. I suffer from low grade ovarian cancer and am currently stable after surgery and six months of chemotherapy, but will almost definitely never be cancer free. I am likely to die within the next 2 to 8 years.  

When I was in the midst of treatment, I felt so close to death and was scared, but also very weak. My sickness felt like a stroke of fate. I was abandoned by my mother as a young child and consequently had severe anxiety and depression growing up. An illness that rendered me infertile didn’t really come as any surprise. As a teenager I used to pray for death as I didn’t have the resolve to kill myself. I felt like everything made sense in this perverse logic I had constructed to make sense of how messed up everything is.

Now I am healthy again, the knowledge of my impending death feels so complicated. I’m going to return to school next year to finish my degree and hopefully travel. I have no desire to work ever again. To me working was something I had to do in order to save for my future family, something I will never have.

In some ways I try to reason with myself that this is just the narrative of my life, tricking myself that I’m important - to make my early, sad death more meaningful. All these ways I try to conceptualise death to make it less daunting, so I can accept it beyond an unfair sickness taking my life before I even really got to live it.

I feel like there’s rarely space for these stories. Maybe it is rare that someone gets the experience of being healthy with the knowledge of their death. Before I got sick I didn’t realise you could be weeks away from dying for cancer whilst being completely fine in every other way. I would love to hear some of your stories and feelings about knowing your death will come way sooner than you ever expected.

Fast forward to 2019 and my hair had grown back with the chemo curls and while I wasn't happy it was curly, I'm just glad I could grow my hair again.

 I wasn't especially excited at first but after getting out the chair and seeing my reflection in the mirror I felt a kind of joy I haven't had in a long time. As soon as he held up the mirror to show the back of my head a big smile came across my face. I'd always been especially fond of my hair so to see it come back curly and a mess was interesting for sure. But 6 months later and I'm finally starting to look like my old self again and it's truly amazing. You never realise how much you take for granted and how much the little things really help you.

I hope any of you can find even the smallest amount of joy in the little things like I did today! Even through these trying times. Anyone else have little things that have made them happy?",2019-05-29 02:15:46

Was circling in front of me like she was going to go the bathroom on my mom's rug. As I'm watching her she poops out a ham! Like a legit quarter ham, wrapped in plastic, with a price sticker on it. I'm not sure who was more shocked, her or me. I thought this has to be a trick and I woke myself up without shitting the bed and went downstairs (but no luck.

About a year ago, I was diagnosed with stage 4 Hodgkins Lymphoma, and immediately, being a redditor, I looked for a cancer related subreddit. Somewhere I could ask questions, get support, and just talk to someone. 

Being a gamer (WoW addict unfortunately), and knowing how universal Discord is, I brought up the suggestion, and not soon after, a Discord server was made. Immediately joined, and we started our own server journey.

From that we've built a community of approximately 200 users currently, more or less. Over 1 year and counting. Some more talkative than others, myself being almost always on. Since day 1, I've been able to make some great friendships, got questions answered by people, and able to get through one of, if not the hardest time in my life. Now I want to offer (well, make more visible) our servers to every one reading this subreddit, since the new layouts and mobile apps don't offer the visibility to see the link.


**https://discord.gg/zGA3b4m**

Any and all are welcome in the server. We just ask you mind a few rules (just about same as in the subreddit) and respect others. We have people going through treatment, people in remission, caretakers, and everything in between.

While it may require an account, it's worth the few seconds. We have people almost constantly on, and willing to talk or even just listen. Don't be shy. Just say hey and feel free to jump into whatever we're talking about. We would love to talk with you.

In 2013 my Mom died a sudden death due to pancreatic cancer. She was absolutely our foundation and walls of our family. We were all lost without her. 

Then, a few years later, my Dad was diagnosed with Esophagus cancer. Our rug had been pulled out of my feet again. I’ve cared for both parents extensively during their illness. I moved into their home with my child to care for them. 

Last Thanksgiving and Christmas, we honestly thought my Dad wouldn’t be around for any other holiday. But yesterday, not only was he here, he was pain free and able to play with the grandkids, joke and kid around, and eat. It reminded me of a time before cancer invaded our little home. And for the briefest of moments, we were all happy. 

Even though my dad has lost over 60lbs, had to rely on tube feeding to survive and has been considered terminal for over a year, here he is. 

I just want to let others know that miracles can happen. Remind your loved ones why you love them. The little things matter just as much as the big moments. 

I hope everyone is able to spend some time with your loved ones during the holidays. Make them a dish they can eat. Give them something to enjoy if they are in the hospital. Offer to go to their house instead of having them come to you, or wherever they feel comfortable. Don’t be upset if they don’t feel like going out to your house or event. ",2018-11-24 15:02:11

January mastectomy and recovery. 

February another surgery for my fucking chemo port which still hasn't been taken out.

Feb-April was 4 sessions of chemo

May - June fucking radiation 5 times a week... Seriously I just want to go home after fucking work, I don't want to go to another fucking place for a fucking hour after work. Yes the procedure itself is 20 minutes but holy fuck it's 40-60 mins total daily. I can't wait for the pain to show up /s. 

June-5 years from now estrogen blocking pill and occasional checkups. Honestly that's the best part a pill a day... Done!!! Go on with life, once every so often see oncologist.... Great make it on a Monday after work the shittiest day of the week...then fuck off doc!!

The docs say 6 months if I do nothing, 2 years if chemo does well for me. Mayyyyyybe 5 years if I'm super lucky. 

My roommate and my boyfriend just... don't get it. I'm trying to tell them, ""Guys, since chemo makes me feel great half the time, and like total hammered cr\*p the other half of the time... if I live 5 years, I have about 900 ""good days"" that I get to enjoy. If I live 2 years I have about 300+ good days I can enjoy, probably. I DO NOT want to spend those days in a messy, dirty, disorganized house, so HELP ME!""

They don't. Chemo is helping me feel and act as if I am getting back to being ""normal me."" My cancer is an intestinal one that is relatively asymptomatic to someone just looking at me. They're all sunshine, rainbows, and ""you're gonna beat this!!"" positive attitude. Which I would appreciate more if it didn't seem like an excuse to be in total denial and change nothing about how they act day to day.

I'm \*this close\* to just flipping out and telling them both to move out. It's dark sounding, I know but... I'd rather be alone and face the end alone, than live in the kind of mess two ""adult"" man-babies can make of a house, y'know?

Just needed to vent about denial masquerading as positive vibes, in a forum where people will probably ""get it."" And IDK... can anyone give advice about how to make the most of the time you have, on a strict poverty budget? Anyone who's kinda been there who can relate?

I have, like 5 close people in my life, total. And 4 of them just... they just are not equipped to handle this. My BFF of 20 years is amazing, but I can't dump all this on one friend, y'know? The local support group seems to meet just once a month. 

I kinda think... therapy, maybe? I don't even know how that would help, though. I feel like I'm dealing with things calmly and practically, and the people around me are just pretending everything's gonna be ok. Why do \*they\* need to believe that, but I can be okay with trying to make the most of the time I have? Why do they \*get\* to believe that, when I can't afford to act that way? I'm not angry about the darn cancer at this point, it's just a mindless force of nature. An accident of genetics. I'm angry at the people who I need to depend on, but I in many ways can't. 

I'm OK, I really have made my peace. I've always tried to live my life with no reasons for regret or missed adventures. I could go today and I'd be sad, but not scared or angry. I'm taking the diagnosis better than everyone around me, TBH, both emotionally and in the sense of being hopeful but not denying the medical facts either.

I wanted a place to go to speak to other people who are going through cancer treatment and the stand alone forums and all the websites like American cancer society just had too scary of statistics to manage 

The internet is a very scary place, you never know who you will encounter and how they will react to you asking for emotional support. People on the internet aren’t as nice as your friends and families who know you. But sometimes you get lucky. 

My first post here was to ask anyone else if they had the same cancer as me. I have a very rare cancer and a very subset of that cancer. This women who was 12 years older than me responded and told me to message her anytime. 

From May to August through the up and downs of treatments, deciding which chemo to pick, waiting for scan results, etc she helped me. We were complete opposites she was married with kids living in the a small city in the south and I am younger single living in New York. She Always spoke about how we effect others when we go through treatment and how our job is not only to change our outlook on life but also theirs. She’s been fighting for 3 years and she taught me to normalize it. She went to part time work when she can if even she was tired and tried to travel. She cared for her son deeply. Even after chemos and radiation’s she would be so tired she made it a daily effort to go outside and play with her son. 

In July I received terrible news that my disease has spread to my lung. At this point I been sick since 21 and I have been in treatment so long I couldn’t battle anymore. I couldn’t find a way to live. If living required another a year of treatment I couldn’t physically do it. I was highly suicidal, not listening to my family or friends and completely babbling psychosis. She was the only person that was able to stop me and talk me from a ledge. She reached out to me after reading one of my posts and was extremely worried about my state of mind. She told me how important I am to my family and to her and how we must continue forward because it is the only way to go, there is no suicidal option. 

This Redditor recently passed away. I’m not sure from what or when but I saw she was posting less I was concerned and checked her last posts and messaged her and she had told me she was in the hospital for the last 8 weeks for an infection. 

Out of respect to her and her family I am not putting her name here but she was a special Person of this subreddit. She answered a lot of questions and offered a lot of advice. She was always willing to lend a helping hand, especially when it came to patients who are fighting while raising young kids. 

This is my memorial to her, I thank her for every wisdom she’s given me and I thank this forum for allowing me to meet her. 

Even if you just answer a comment, or answer a dm from a newly diagnosed person who is scared and doesn’t know where to go, you are helping someone. You mean more than you think. 

We are all fighting this disease together, in our own way but there are rarities in the connections that we make where we can make it a little easier to mood forward. 

May this Redditor rest easy and may you all be healthy in the new year

This year my 10 year niece was diagnosed with cancer. Its been tough but we feel so incredibly blessed to be around people who care so much. 

We also spent Christmas in the hospital and she was quite upset intially. However the entire week was filled with nurses, doctors, volunteers from various organisations and even fellow patients and thier families all organising activities and handing out presents. 
 People are so incredibly generous not only with money but just with the time and effort they spend in making other people happy.

On Christmas Eve we also handed out presents to all the nurses and the patients and just seeing the smile on their faces was worth it. There were children from 17 weeks old to 13+ years and they were all fighting this tough battle against cancer.

We often live life unaware of the struggle others face and this year has just made us realise how important it is to help others in whatever way we possibly can. We should always count the blessings we have, and take inspiration from others to keep our hope alive and strong.

Cancer is tough on everyone involved and just want to say that Stay Strong Everyone.

To the patients - You all are incredibly brave and wish everyone that is fighting this battle lots of strength and hope and a speedy recovery. 
For the caregivers who are so incredibly selfless you guys are awesome! Often we underappreciate the ones who put in the most effort so thank you for everything you do.
For those that have passed away, our thoughts will always be with you and for those who are missing them during this time, warm hugs to you.

My name is Ali, and I'm 20 years old. I'm also just like many - if not all - of you, I have cancer, and to be exact: chondroblastic osteosarcoma.

I did the surgery two years ago in October 2018, followed by 12 sessions of chemotherapy in about 4-5 months. I was clear ever since then, with no signs of metastasis shown in the extracted part of the left-tibia after the surgery. That is, well... until now.

Today, Oct. 12, 2020, I attended the follow-up appointments with the orthopedist and the oncologist, where I also had taken Computed Tomography scan of my left-leg and my thorax firstly. During the first one, I talked to the orthopedist's assistant about my medical situation (how I feel, pains, how much I can walk without a crutch). She went to discuss the images with the specialist and both entered the room. He checked how well my left lower leg is recovering, and seemed satisfied with how well it does.

He assured the CT images of the tibia looks perfectly fine. As for the lungs however, he told me that I have three spots which seemed to produce calcium and bone matrix, indicating that I have some mets from the sarcoma. The largest one has a diameter of 15 mm, while the others 13 and 7 mm.

I was very speechless about the situation, as I was really excited for hearing good news, considering I have had my titanium plate broken and my stubborn wound that didn't want to close properly until a gastrocnemius flap surgery. Devastated, however, isn't strong enough to describe my feeling.

The orthopedist has reassured me that his patients who undergo such situations more than two years after the surgery, don't have any metastasis anymore when they underwent the lung surger(ies) and/or the adjacent chemotherapy.

The oncologist has shown me the lung images and shown me where they're exactly located: two on the right lung and one in the left. He has told me a chemo won't help, so he explained the two types of lung surgery. The first one is to open the cage and touch the area and sense where the lesion is located. He told me that you would have to stay longer in the hospital and that it's very big surgery. The other one is to use small cameras inserted from the sides of the body and more specifically find the lesions and extract them. It seemed people with such situations undergo this one, not only should I stay in the hospital for like three days, it's a relatively smaller surgery, and the oncologist seems more confident that I would choose for this one. He attempted to make an urgent appointment with the thoracic - which he seemed to trust him very much - so that I discuss with him the best procedure and plan a surgery ASAP.

The moment I came back home, I shed so many tears and I can't stop. I'm not afraid of the surgery, or if necessary, the chemo as well, heck I even told the doctors loudly that I want to get rid of them. I fear what's unknown, I question myself what will happen after that with me, my family, my friends, and anyone who I know and who knows me. I've always believed that once it's gone, it's going to be normal again, but little did I know. I'm starting to think this is like movies which have many sequels, such as Batman or I don't know. Is it, just... wrong to have a definitive happy ending, where it's gone once and for all?

Wednesday, I'll have to undergo a nuclear magnetic resonance imaging where they're going to check the bones for something suspicious, which I definitely hope not there is.

And here I am, sitting in my room, having no clue what's next, who am I going to tell, or what am I going to do with my life. I've been optimistic and to this very moment, I still am. But my clueless, coward self is very triggered because of this slap to the face. What must I do?",2020-10-13 01:16:15

Chemo worked. She was operated. They gave radiation to decrease the chance of recurrence, but before the treatment was over the cancer had spread to her lungs. We found this out in October 2019. They gave another trearment. In February this year we found out it spread to her liver. She got an experimental treatment that didn't work for her during which the cancer spread to her eyes and brain. Her liver had worsened as well. She got the same chemotreatment as the one she was on first. It seemed to help a little but they stopped it for some time so they could give radiation treatment for her brain. Today the chemo was supposed to start again. My mom has been having a lot of pain from her liver this weekend and she has been feeling very tired. So she expected her bloodcount would be too low for chemo and she expected to get a blood transfusion. To our surprise, we get the news that they're stopping treatment and they're starting up morfine to reduce the pain (palliative care).

This feels like such a whirlwind. Up until when she was getting the radiation for her brain (which ended a week ago) the doctors kept telling us not to give up hope and not to panick. I knew she couldn't be cured, but with the message they were giving I assumed she still had months (at least), especially since the chemo seemed to be working somewhat. I don't really know what to expect. The doctor said she would slip into a coma at some point, but he said he couldn't really indicate how long she still has. I know they're giving her medication to keep the pain under control, but I just keep asking myself whether the body might not give some kind of stress reaction in the end making her feel anxious or something. I just hope she is comfortable...

I'm still sitting with her in the hospital atm while she's sleeping. She hasn't said a lot since she got the news. My dad was very worried this morning, but due to corona only one person could come with her. I don't live with my parents anymore, so I was unaware of how much it had worsened in a few days. If I knew what was up and how worried my dad was, I would have given my spot to him. We haven't informed him yet since I don't want to tell him over the phone.

Regression we beat it - then 40 days later, over a July 4th weekend barbecue, she said she felt some discomfort in the same area as before. The cancer was back and growing at twice the rate. Highly aggressive. Like it knew we tried to kill it and wanted revenge. 

We tried three rounds of immunotherapy. No response. Fuck it, we knew that was a longshot anyway. She didn’t have the right genetic marker that showed the best clinical success with that particular drug. In a few weeks time the mass on the back of her tongue grew so large it was robbing her of the ability to swallow or even talk. 
She had to have a gastric feeding tube put in. 
The dietician set her caloric requirements target to 2,500 cal/day + 100 grams of protein. 
This is what an athlete fueling up for a game day probably consumes - but this was a daily target. 

What solid food she could ingest had to be blended down into a purée. Have you ever seen someone attempt to enjoy puréed steak or chicken?  Astronaut food paste. It sucks.  

In late November we moved on to a new dual compound drug. Five rounds of a more aggressive chemotherapy. The compound began to work effectively and quite noticeably by the third session. The tumor shrank. Her CT scans came back with increasingly positive news. 

Her liveliness and desire to go out and do activities, although limited, returned. We went to the movies - Knives Out. Her appetite returned. Things were on the upswing. 

I was getting my mother back and not this hollow shell of an entity that used to represent my mother  occupying the spare bedroom in my house ... the one that now doubled as a medical center.


It’s like the cancer knew we were winning again and so it decided to employ a new trick to fuck us over - it waited for a blood infection to strike. She felt a little wheezy on Friday. They gave her a strong dose of antibiotic drip during the chemo session. 

Saturday she felt a little better. Sunday, not so well. Sunday night diarrhea. Monday, wouldn’t leave the room but largely responsive. By Tuesday she was deep in the throws of septic shock. Unable to fight off the illness, she died early this morning. 

I was with her in her waning hours. She looked at me and called me “Mom” although I’m her son. Her speech was garbled and unintelligible. I gave her a pad and pen so she could hopefully communicate with me - all she wrote was “Home”. Over and over and over. Each letter deteriorating in repetition.

She was Lifeflighted to a pre-eminent medical facility. The medical staff did everything they could for her but the level of toxicity in her blood was simply too great. Seven hours later her soul joined the ever after.

I just am really sad and need to talk to strangers anonymously if that’s okay.

My dad was my best friend and my other half pretty much. And my best friend went to the hospital in February for a stomach ache- he had been acting funny for the past few months but kept saying “just stressed out with work”. And a week later, he was diagnosed with stage four liver cancer, and died a week after that.

I didn’t know a lot about cancer before this. I always thought you had a fighting chance, treatments, surgeries, hope. I didn’t know what stage four meant. I didn’t know what metastatic meant. When I got the diagnosis, I thought I would be running charity races to raise money for him.

I didn’t think it could be, “we found cancer, and he is not a candidate for chemo or surgery. Plan your finances. You might have a couple of months with him.” 

I didn’t think it would be as quick as two weeks. 

I didn’t think I wouldn’t get a father daughter dance, he wouldn’t see me run the Boston marathon someday, or help me raise an Australian Shepherd. I know those things seem so silly and of course there are way bigger issues in the world, but those were my dreams and I never pictured my dreams maybe coming true without him being a part of them. I’m gonna be 28 and I’m crying like a child about not being able to call my dad during work breaks. I feel like the biggest loser for how sad I’ve been in the past three months. I’m scared I’m never going to be normal again, and that’s because my dad was the person that always made everything better.

I feel guilty for not knowing how to help him. I’m not a doctor, I’m just a photographer. But I researched everything and was with him for 14 days straight in the hospital. I sometimes wonder if I just missed something. We had great doctors, and I know it was terminal. I guess I still haven’t come to terms with what terminal illness is, and I am just sad about this too because I’m normally a rational person. 

I am just so heartbroken and lost. And I’m sorry for everyone that’s going through this too. I hope you guys find peace.

Surprised to learn I would not have chemo or surgery. The slow-growing, estrogen-sensitive tumor would be treated with hormone blockers and a fairly new medication (Imbrance). Side effects have been minimal. I have not had to give up any activities.

I'm a Christian and believe that I have received the ""peace that passes understanding."" I could tell you more about that aspect if anyone is interested.

 It helps that I am older (76), so that may be why the treatment is less aggressive , but it appears to be working as the tumor has shrunk a bit. My oncologist says I should think of it as a chronic illness for which I will need continued treatment. At my age, I take it one day at a time. I have already had a long life so think of any future as a bonus.

I feel like the last week has been an absolute blur. My 10 year old daughter has something, not sure what at this point, in her brain. Tumor, mass, whatever they're calling it until we can get some kind of biopsy done. 

It began July 21 with a doctor's visit because of persistent migraine type headaches. No vomiting or any other symptoms, just a headache that has persisted for the past week almost. Doctor noticed that her pupils were of different sizes and sent her for a full blood panel, x-ray, and then to an optometrist. Nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary on anything, even the optometrist didn't see any weird pressure in her eye although her left eye was 1.5-2 whatevers off from her right eye. 

I am very thankful for her pediatrician. She persisted and got us an MRI scheduled July 22. She called us at 2:30 the same day, it's a mass and we're to be admitted into the hospital the next morning. The tumor didn't want to wait and her headaches started to cause pain spikes later that night and we ended up in the ER. The powerlessness you feel as a father with your daughter crying out in pain nearly has you physically hurting with her. They got a pain cocktail in her and she finally was able to sleep.

This thing is sitting in her 3rd ventricle of the brain blocking flow of spinal fluid, causing pressure build up. We feel blessed at the moment since it's not spread down her spine and all panels are coming back clear, so it's not spreading. There is a calcification around the tumor, so a biopsy could release things into the system and allow a spread, but we don't have any options. We don't know what we're fighting.

We've been in the hospital since. Her right eye is starting to get blurry, like the left, and she's developed some tinnitus. She is being so strong. She's seen the pictures, knows what's going to happen, and the only concern she shows is ""Are they going to stick me with a needle again?"" 

I know there isn't much here, just our story thus far. It feels good to get it out there into the void. Covid has changed how hospitals operate, so it just the parents in the room. Everyone else has to be outside and we meet them in the parking lot. Skype has become a friend just to see people. 

We've setup a [CaringBridge](https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/kaleyhall) site. It's not much, but it's nice to know people are walking with us. The worst part of this is feeling like you're walking alone. We ask nothing of anyone, but to just read the story. If it end here or we continue on, thank you for walking this with us.

Edit: She had her first surgery for an endoscopic third ventriculostomy and biopsy. We now know we're dealing with small round blue cell tumor and my daughter is finally without headaches. We'll know in the next couple of days the pathology. Thank you all for your stories and well wishes.

It drives me fucking crazy that I barely made it outside the hospital from my (literally) 2 minute consult and the hospital went into lockdown, cause it will now serve as a coronavirus center. They couldn't book me for another procedure, cause the room that has all the books and calendars is being renovated now -.- asked me to call next week, but I don't see a point now that the hospital only deals with coronavirus. That's the only place I can get my procedure done. Fuck. I may have to have my bladder, uterus and ovaries removed, but won't know until I get that second procedure and the histopathology results come back.

How the fuck did we let this shit spread so widely. It's not going to be only the elderly that the coronavirus may kill. Medicine doesn't end with coronavirus.

She had been diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer about a year before being diagnosed with the unrelated gallbladder cancer. The awful excuse for a doctor called her oncologist missed the gallbladder cancer diagnosis and thought it was a gallstone. She was diagnosed in 5 minutes by a surgeon who were were seeing for the gallstone removal.  From there she was in and out of hospitals and received cancer treatments at City of Hope but unfortunately nothing was effective. 

She was free and happy and positive.  She was SO selfless.  She was so good down to her core. That's one of the things people from all walks of life have been saying about her. She was my mom and my absolute best friend.  She was my everything. I still can't believe she's gone.  Sometimes it hits me like a ton of bricks and knocks the breath out of me. She passed away at 12:37 am on Feb 27 just as we got to the hospital after the nurse called to tell me to come back because her heart rate was rapidly falling. Immediate and extended family had been with her for hours (my dad and I had been with her the entire day but left for an hour to come back and stay the rest of the night) but it was like her to pass just after everyone else had left so we wouldn't be upset or sad to see her pass in front of us. She wanted to protect us even through the end. Through all of her suffering she never once complained or lamented why me. She is the strongest person I will ever know. I am so incredibly lucky to have had her as my mom and my best friend.

903,Today my dad (Glioblastoma stage 4) and I just saw an MRI with no new growth!,73,em00m9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/em00m9/today_my_dad_glioblastoma_stage_4_and_i_just_saw/,12,1578551058.0,"My dad (67) was diagnosed in late August, and it’s been a whirlwind. He fell down around Labor Day, and showed a lot of cognitive signs relatively suddenly, so we went in and he basically had an MRI immediately and surgery right away that night. Although the diagnosis was devastating (given how young he is and previous experience losing a family friend in 8mos to glio) his surgeon did an amazing job with the resection and managed to remove basically the entire tumor. We were told he could have anywhere from 18-24mos initially, with a possible chance of more time if testament went well. 

Dad started Temodar orally about a month after surgery/rehab, and then radiation five days a week for six weeks. The radiation was really well targeted using a mask, and he didn’t really have any side effects aside from constipation and the standard hair loss in that area. He was a bit tired and a little fuzzy on details, but that was all relatively fine. I moved him in with me, became his primary caretaker, and was prepared to go in for a second session of higher rad this month. We were pretty much dreading it, in fact, but figured what the hell, we gotta do it to give him a chance. He had a prep MRI and we readied for another session. 

But! Today we saw no new growth!!! He’s doing AMAZING and his surgeon really did a fantastic job. Now, instead of having to go IV or higher rad, he will be on oral Temodar again for five days a month for six months, which will likely have a little nausea, but is significantly easier since he can take it at home, and we’re going to try a relatively new FDA-approved device that could bump his chances to make it past 5yrs from 5% to 30%. 

Obviously we can’t always predict how treatment goes and I know that, but the knowledge that I may have more time with him? Just a bit more? That’s huge. Any extra time is a huge thing for me. I’ve been living in a fog for the last months, totally sure my dad would die in a year or less, and now it feels like a fog has lifted. I could have more years with him! Making bad jokes and driving me crazy! More years of my dad is something I didn’t want to hope I could have. 

I just needed to post this and tell someone other than family. DON’T GIVE UP. Life surprises us all. Cancer fucking sucks but humans are resilient and science is advancing every day. I hope all of you get similarly hopeful news in 2020. ❤️",2020-01-09 06:24:18

I got diagnosed with it at 14 but with the size of the tumor attached to my liver you could tell it had been growing for years I barely had any symptoms and it took me going into foster care and my foster mom thinking I had an eating disorder to get seen and diagnosed . Originally there were no treatments and only surgery was an option but 2 years later when I was 16 I started on a treatment called keytruda which basically ramps up your immune system to attack your cancer cells . That worked for me for another 2 years or so but soon they noticed tumors were actually continuing to grow . I then switched to another treatment I forget the name which did work for a while but then all of a sudden it gave me severe inflammation to the point I ended up in the hospital for a week with pretty significant pain . At this point my doctor is saying she doesn’t believe that there are any other treatment options that would be helpful for me and so we are kinda at the end of the road here according to her . I’ve never met anyone with my kind of cancer . Any comments and advice would be so appreciated I honestly am not sure what to do at this point.,2019-12-22 00:32:47

He was really secretive with the whole thing (specific type, stage, if he was getting treatment etc) and it was really hard to get answers from him. Every time I asked how he was doing he would nod and say, ""I'm okay, you know, just trying to get better"" and I'll always remember his voice when he gave that answer, it sounded very defeated yet you can tell he wanted to be strong for my family and I. He lived with my parents the last couple of months because he started to feel a little weaker as time went on. I still hoped that he would get better and had dreams where he looked ""non sick"" and I would tell him how much better he looked. By Thanksgiving he started to get more reclusive and looked incredibly weak and pale. Still I thought ""He'll get through this, it has to get worse before it could get better"".

A week in a half before he passed, he had fallen and bruised his eye pretty bad, and I went to see him and he looked worse and worse, started talking less, and could barely hear him, would stand with his walker in the house when he got tired just to catch his breathe. The last Sunday I saw him I had taken the whole family out to lunch because I wanted to spend some family time with all of us. He barely ate, and would put his head down because he was so weak and looked incredibly pale and his mouth..he kept his bottom shriveled and it would tremble from time to time. Yet when he saw his niece (my baby daughter) he would light up and it made me smile. He always asked about her and told my wife and I to come visit so he could see her. When we left the restaurant I gave him a hug and said ""Alright, bro love you man, see you later"". Those were the last words that I spoke to him and I will never ever forget those words.

He wasn't perfect, but he was my older brother and the oldest of us siblings. We laughed together, cried together, and got into fights, all the things that brothers do.

She was diagnosed with a rare uterine cancer (MMMT/ Carcinosarcoma) in July. The doctor said it was “very treatable” the plan was 3 rounds of chemo and then surgery. The third chemo was the turning point. They had to switch chemos because she developed an allergic reaction to the first one. The second one only made her sick and did nothing to the tumor. 

Now it has spread to her intestines and she can’t eat or drink anything because of the tumors blocking several points in her digestive tract. Yet she is throwing up several times a day. How is that even possible?! 

Now they are saying that the only thing that can heal her is if this new chemo she got 3 days ago works. They can’t operate on her and didn’t offer radiation. This is our Hail Mary. I’m trying to be as hopeful as I can but seeing her frail body (she lost so much weight) with bones showing all over, Its getting harder and harder not to come unhinged.

Part of this is that I come from a family and community of very faith focused people, while my wife and I fall into more of an agnostic belief system. Everyone I've told wants to make it a conversation about capital G god, and that is not cathartic for me in any way. 

Last week my son had a high fever and some lethargy, but was otherwise his normal 19 month old tornado of a person. Thursday I took him to a pediatrician for an abdominal inspection due to bloating, and was told he was gassy. Saturday while I was at a fantasy football draft my wife noticed a lump in his abdomen. She took him to urgent care, who referred us to the ER. Five hours later we are told we need to drive 8 hours to the children's hospital. 24 hours later we are being told that our baby boy has Hepatoblastoma. Currently his liver is massive, and the cancerous mass will not be able to be resected until he has completed several rounds of chemo. We are awaiting full biopsy results to determine a more specific diagnosis. We are being told nothing specific regarding stage or prognosis other than, ""most likely very treatable,"" which makes me angry. We have no hard data, which makes me angry. He has been an amazing, sweet, talkative, loving baby his whole life, and that being stolen from him makes me angry. 

More than anything I'm angry that there's nothing to blame. I am so scared, sad, and furious, and there's not a fucking thing we can do other than love him and try to be strong. I don't know what to do.

I have gained immense respect for all of the other people out there who have experienced this bullshit disease first hand or as parents. Fuck this stupid sickness.

Things are incredibly upside down in the world, but if you can, take the time to do the things you really want to do. Go to the beach! Drink that glass of wine (my mom wouldn’t drink because of her liver metastasis). 

I understand that doing what you want to do is a privilege not many have, but if you can, please, enjoy the things you like without guilt.

926,Teen (13F) embarrassed of my cancer (33F).,73,gbocmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/gbocmn/teen_13f_embarrassed_of_my_cancer_33f/,26,1588389224.0,"I was diagnosed with leukemia Aug 2019 and had a BMT Dec 2019.  Spend a good 4 1/2 months in the hospital due to complications. 

During that time, my daughter refused to let any of her friends know what was happening at home, and when they found out, she was extremely embarrassed. She said she ‘didn’t want to be known as the girl who’s mom has cancer’. It was quite upsetting to her when the news circulated her school, even though the feedback was sympathetic and supportive.  

Now I’m home and doing well. My hair is just now growing back, and I have dar circles under my eyes, but i no longer scream’CANCER PATIENT!!’ When you look at me.   However, my daughter refuses to participate in any outside activities with me if it’s close to home (walking, riding bikes, etc).  She states it’s because she doesn’t want people to know the sad story of her mom having cancer and she’s embarrassed .  I’ve tried to reason with her by offering to wear a headscarf or a wig, but no luck. She doesn’t want to be seen in public with me. At home, indoors, she’s fine. If I drive 20/30 minutes away to go hiking or whatever with her, she’s fine as now one knows her’. 

She has been in therapy this whole time and her therapist just said to ‘give it time’, as she’s young. 

I know this whole thing has been hard on her and she’s only 13, but Jesus, it absolutely kills me my child feels this way. I don’t really know how to resolve the situation and now that it is getting nicer out, I’d like to be able to go do stuff with her without driving 30 minutes away.

Six months ago my ankle was hurting and i noticed a soft bump so i went to my doctor and she told me that i might have soft tissue damage and just to elevate and use heat come back in if it hurts. I had off and on pain but nothing really painful. On my birthday on the 7th my ankle really hurt and i noticed a lot of swelling. I also noticed my lymph nodes in my groin swelled which alarmed me so i made a appointment with my doctor. She was concerned about my lymph nodes so made a referral to a hematologist. The hematilogist thought there was a connection between my ankle and lymph nodes. Last Tuesday I got a ultrasound my hematologist was concerned about a sarcoma in my ankle so last thursday i got a biopsy. They took two samples of my ankle and a needle biopsy in my lymph node. Since last Thursday ive been on edge and had every emotion possible still trying to be optimistic. Today i found out the results that from my lymph nodes there is metastatic cancer but they dont know what kind of cancer I have in my ankle. They have to send the biopsy to another clinic for further analysis. Monday I have a appointment to figure out a plan. If anyone has any advice I'm here for it all.",2019-12-27 08:49:22

It’s about time things take a turn for the worse again, seeing as how everything been so great lately (up for a promotion at work, been seeing a great girl). It’s just like when I was diagnosed. Everything was going SUSPICIOUSLY amazing, before it came crashing down. It was just like a movie. 

I know it may be nothing to worry about. Lymph nodes can swell up for a number of things. It’s just a little concerning and it’s tough not to be alarmed by every little thing happening in my body, as I’m sure you all know.

2nd time on 2010.  Now it is in some lymph nodes around the kidneys.  3 rounds BEP(?) and we are done.  

3rd times is a charm.......Flash forward to 2 months ago.  Head and neck pain take me to Kaiser ED.  Head and neck CT leads to Head and Neck MRI which gives us a diagnosis of lesion on right shoulder affecting hypoglossal nerve.  

Given history of cancer, my Dr orders a PET scan.  I light up like a Christmas tree.  Bone lesions on right clavicle, left humerus, T-12 vertebra, the top bone of my neck, and the retro peritoneal lymph nodes that surround my aorta and vena cava.

Now we are off to the races.  Is this a recurrence of my original cancer or is this a new one?  If it is a recurrence then it is easier to treat and more responsive to chemo.  If it is an all new type, then we have a new set of rules.


I just had a biopsy this past Thursday and am awaiting results.

She had been fighting cancer and the repercussions of it for the past 10 years. First she was diagnosed with breast cancer, had a double mastectomy, diagnosed with diabetes, then was recently diagnosed with metastatic bone cancer that was ‘innumerable’ and found everywhere in her body.

She was the kindest, sweetest, most compassionate woman I’d ever known. She was simple in tastes and joys and needed only a day at the beach or a walk in the park to be happy. Fresh fruit and warm soups were always her favorites.

Cancer took all of that away from her. She suffered, mightily I’ll add, for the last 10 years. In some ways I’m happy she no longer needs to exist in this plane of existence. In others. I’m devastated beyond all degrees of sadness.

The summary is Choroid Plexus Carcinoma (brain tumor) at 11 months, 7 rounds of chemo. Stopped in late February.

The doctors knew he had leptomeningeal disease but said it has been stable. Said it had actually progressed but his carefree oncologist said “he can take the summer off, or we can try this?” Her reasoning behind trying something did little to instill confidence in us. Just seemed like she was in over her head. We would bring up other Dr and she seemed to scoff (yeah I’ve heard of them, why). His April scans were exactly the same as before.

I feel as though I’ve failed him. I’ve failed my son. I shouldn’t have stopped for those 2 months.

He started randomly vomiting a few times a day. His oncologist said something along the lines ‘if it worries you enough take him to the ER.’

We did. They maybe thought he had some hemorrhaging, according to a CT. 

It wasn’t hemorrhaging. It’s his leptomeningeal advancing over the top of his brain and down the sides, very, very quickly. As it does. In less than 8 weeks.

So.. it seems our options are really what they were before.. give him a break,.. or maybe ruin what time he has left with attempts to give him more time (which may end up being horrible from more treatment).

I don’t understand. We knew we felt like we weren’t getting everything from our doctors.. and now.. I just don’t understand.

I know a lot of cancer “survivors”—it’s a cringe term *to me*—have stated that they hate being told they’re brave. Or that they’re so strong. Or that they’re a fighter. I know this isn’t a unique thought of my own. I just hate when friends leave comments on social media saying those things, or when my sister posts a photo of us, and I happen to be bald, the whole comment section turns into tagging me and saying how beautiful I am and I have such a nice shaped head for chemo. Thanks? 

I couldn’t figure out why it pissed me off so much to see those comments. And then I realized today when I posted a collage showing hair growth what upset me. I thought how fast my hair suddenly started growing was interesting, and there are a lot of people I know who haven’t seen me in a while, so I thought I’d update. I regret it now. My whole comment section is full of the same thing: you’re so brave, you’re so positive!, way to look at things positively in such a scary fight!, etc etc. Just a million ways of saying the same thing, and all of it saying nothing. 

I just went to show my sister the ONE funny comment a high school friend left on the post, and I told her the rest of the comments pissed me off. 

I don’t feel brave now and I didn’t during chemo. I didn’t feel like I was battling anything. I didn’t feel like I had the heart of a lion, full of courage. I didn’t feel strong. I was at the weakest I have ever been during chemo. And I’m still pretty weak. I have to ask people to help me open jars now and lift boxes at work. I’m the youngest in my department and now I have to ask everyone else to grab heavy equipment for me. 

I **was** a strong and independent woman before chemo. I still feel that deep down, in character I guess, but physically, I am weak and dependent. In all honesty, going through chemo wasn’t brave. __*I felt like a rat. A lab rat that was trapped, and the only way out was to let the doctors experiment on me.*__ That’s not noble or courageous. That’s just allowing things to happen to you. What was my other choice? Literally: just hope that the cancer wouldn’t come back. And surprise! I’m still there now, 3 months out of chemo. Hoping and praying that the cancer doesn’t show up in my lungs or brain. 

What bravery is there when I cry into my pillow, asking God to just take away the pain, the anxiety, to lift the chemo fog? What battle am I fighting when I agreed to have these chemicals put in my body and I’m crumpled on my bed, screaming and begging for the bone pains to go away? What courage is there in going back to work and trying to pretend that I’m okay and everything is fine and I haven’t been absolutely ravaged physically and mentally?",2019-05-31 13:24:55

We just lost my mother in law who was practically my mother. I married into a middle Eastern family and being a guy from a small town in rural Eastern Texas was definitely an eye opening experience coming into a family like this. We've let my MIL live with us for the last 15 years.

6 years ago she started having problems going to the bathroom and started cramping. She went to the doctor and asked repeatedly for a CT or a colonoscopy but was rejected each time for a year because the doctor said it was just internal hemorrhoids. A year goes by and she's still having issues. Finally gets the CT and they find a mass the size of a grapefruit in her intestines and multiple tumors in her uterus. The doctor immediately signs her up for radiation and to start chemo.

A few months go by and they think there's a chance they can do surgery to remove it. The doctor goes in to remove it and opens her up and is horrified to find that because of the radiation, the tumor has fused itself to a bunch of arteries in her colon and also burned fistulas in her colon which in turn started to leak fecal matter into her body. More on that later. After the surgery we are told that her insurance will no longer support her because she and my FiL make too much money. She makes 600 a month from SSI and he makes 900 and it's their only source of income. They have to lie and tell the insurance company and the hospital that they are separated after 49 years of marriage so that way she can get state provided health care coverage. The hospital then puts in a few stents, a colostomy bag.

A year goes by and we find out about MD Anderson so we find out they'll cover her and start treatment. They were fantastic and started treating her right away. We tried multiple chemos and experimental treatments where she was like patient number 2 in the world to get these immunotherapy drugs. Everything failed. During all this time she's on antibiotics the entire time due to the fistulas leaking fecal matter into her body which they can't operate on because her intestines are like tissue paper. She's in and out of the hospital for a few years dealing with these infections.

So queue up October 15th. She is admitted to the hospital at 2am in the morning for abdominal cramping and she's unable to keep anything down. They CT her and find that she has an infection in her abdomen the size of a football that has compartmentalized itself so she didn't have chilling or fevers. It pushed her intestines and colon to the upper right side of her abdomen. They tried for 4 days to get the infection under control by using 5 different of the most powerful antibiotics they could use on her. On Thursday the 18th we got to the hospital and we're met with two docs in the room. The one standing in back said Palliative care on her jacket. I knew before she said a word how this was gonna go. She told us there's nothing more we can do and that we have to look into end of life care. We chose hospice and my MiL was coherent and made the decision to go to hospice. We were expecting her to live for 3 maybe 4 days and so were the doctors.

The first 3 days in hospice she was on heavy heavy morphine but she was still coherent and we said our goodbyes and cried and cried. It was very hard because she begged for food and water for 3 days but we couldn't give it to her because he stomach and intestines were already destroyed by the infection After 3 days she closed her eyes and didn't open them again. Because of her infection she had to be left cut open with just gauze over the open section. Day 6 the smells started setting in and filling the entire facility. It was the most traumatic thing I've ever experienced and she lasted a full 20 days with no food and water.

I didn't write this and I'm not sure who did, it popped up on my Facebook feed. I wish I was told this when I was diagnosed:

Your relationships are about to change. All of them. Some will get stronger. They will probably not be with the people you would expect. The people you want to handle this well might not be able to for a variety of reasons. Some of the reasons will be selfish. Some of them will be entirely innocent and circumstantial. All of them will be forgivable because no one plans for cancer. Carrying bitterness or anger won't help your recovery. Fighting for anyone to stick with you won't cure you. Those who can, will.

You will be determined to have more energy than you do. You will convince yourself that you are thinking straight, are able to handle all of this and do not need anyone. You will run out of fuel. Your body will change first and your mind will follow. You won't lose your mind, memories or sensibility. It will all come back. But, you will be different. You will never have the same sense of self. You should embrace this. Your old self was probably really great. Your transformed self will be even better. Give in to what is happening and trust it.

You are going to feel fear. Even if you are normally stubborn, confident and seemingly invincible you will finally find yourself admitting that you are scared of something. Cancer is scary and incredibly confusing. The unknowing will eat at you worse than the disease itself. You'll need distractions. Music and sleep will probably be the ones you resort to most. Reading will become difficult. So will watching TV or movies, having conversations, writing and basically everything else. They call it ""chemo brain"" for a reason. You will feel normal eventually. Just a new kind of normal. When you feel afraid let yourself lean on those around you. Cry. Be vulnerable. You are vulnerable. There will be time for strength, but never admitting weakness will cause anxiety to mount and your condition to worsen. Let it all out. Yell if you need to. Sing when you feel up to it. Sob uncontrollably. Apologize for your mood swings. Treatments and prescriptions will often be the cause of them. The people that love you will understand.

The people that love you will be just as scared as you are. Probably more. They will be worrying even when they are smiling. They will assume you are in more pain than you are. They will be thinking about you dying and preparing for life without you. They will go through a process that you will never understand just like they will never understand the process you are going through. Let them process. Forgive them when they don't understand. Exercise patience when you can. Know that those that were built for this will be there when you get to the other side and you will all be able to laugh together again. You'll cry together too. Then you'll get to a place where you will just live in the world again together and that is when you know that you have beaten this.

The sooner you recognize that you are mortal, the sooner you can create the mentality for survival. There is a chance you might not make it. Just like there is a chance that you will. Don't look at statistics. You are unique and what is happening inside you is unique. Your fight is yours alone and there are too many factors to compare yourself to others that have had your condition. No one will want you to think about death, but you won't have a choice. You will think about it from the moment you are given your diagnosis. Come to terms with it. Calmly accept it. Then, shift every thought you have into believing that you won't die. You are going to beat this. Your mental focus on that fact will be more powerful than any treatment you receive.

Your doctors and nurses will become your source of comfort. You will feel safe with them. If you do not feel safe with them you need to change your care provider immediately. There is no time to waste. This shouldn't be a game played on anyone's terms but yours. When you find the right caretakers you will know immediately. Do not let insurance, money or red tape prevent you from getting the treatment you deserve. This is your only shot. There is always a way. Find those hands that you trust your life in and willingly give it to them. They will quickly bring you a sense of calm. They will spend time answering your questions. There will be no stupid questions to them. They won't do anything besides make you feel like you are the most important life that exists. They will never make you feel like they don't have things in control. They will be honest and accessible at all times. They might even become your friends. They deserve your gratitude, respect and appreciation daily. If you get upset at them during treatment know that they'll forgive you. They get that you're going through something they can't imagine - but they understand better than anyone. They see it every day and they choose to be there because they want to make the worst experience of your life more tolerable.

You will need to find balance after treatment. Start by seeking balance during treatment. Eat well. Sleep well. Listen to your body. Experiment with new forms of exercise that aren't so demanding. Do not be too proud to speak to someone. You cannot afford to store up the intensity of the emotion that comes with fighting a life-threatening illness. Let it out for yourself. You will begin to hear your voice changing. That voice is who you are becoming in the face of mortality. Listen to that voice. It will be the purest, most authentic version of you that you have ever known. Bring that person into the world -- strengths and vulnerabilities and everything between. Be that person forever.

You will inspire others. It will feel weird. People you haven't spoken to since grade school will be in touch. Ex-boyfriends, former colleagues... even people you felt never wanted to talk to you again. The influx of interest in your seemingly fading life will be greater than any living moment you have ever experienced. That support is what will shift a fading life into a surviving one. Be grateful for every message. Be appreciative of each gift and each visit. There will be moments where all of this attention will make you feel lonelier than you have ever felt in your life. In a hospital room full of people with messages stuffing your inbox, voicemail and mailbox you will find yourself feeling completely alone. This is when you will realize that you could afford to have a stronger relationship with yourself. That only you walk this earth with 100% investment in you. Make the investment and use this as an opportunity to reexamine your self-worth. Love yourself more than ever and recognize how much love there is for you in the world. Then start sharing that love. You will come to see that even when you are the neediest person you know you can still be giving. Giving will make you feel better than taking.

When you get to the other side you won't believe it. They will tell you the disease is gone. Everyone you know will rejoice and return to their lives. You'll constantly wonder if it is coming back. Slowly this feeling will fade, but cancer will always be a part of you. It will define how you see the world moving forward. You're going to feel like the future is a funny thing to think about because the present is going to suddenly seem incredibly important. Keep moving. You'll be more productive. You'll understand who truly loves you because they will still be there. You'll want to meet new people that connect to the newly evolved version of your old self. You'll want to let go of those that don't ""get"" who you are now. You'll feel a little guilty doing it. Then, you'll move on. You don't have time to waste. The greatest gift you've been given is that you now understand that and you're going to make the most of every second. You're going to be the most passionate person you know going forward. Translate that passion to a greater purpose. Be fearless again.""",2014-10-11 02:44:22

      All of you don’t know me but we are here for the same reason, we have all been affected by cancer one way or another. My name is Jacob R. and I am 14 years old . In 2018 my family moved up to where we live now in central California and we’re living a pretty good life up here until around late April of 2019. My mom started seeing complications in her health, we went to the hospital and she was diagnosed with pneumonia and blood clots she was then treated for those things. We saw the hospitals out two more time and it was all going uphill. We were at my 8th grade promotion and she was off of oxogen the entire time and after we had fun, we barbecued, we told stories, etc. Summer started and 4 days in, she had a stroke and was airlifted to west hills hospital. We were there for 31 days. While there we learned that the “pneumonia and blood clots” was a non-small cancer ALK1+. With this news we looked at all of the treatments and saw that there were so many advances in this field and I was so happy that hopefully in a few month life would be normal again. We got out of the hospital and the road to recovery began. We had a few bumps in the road but we were making more progress. Eventually we had learned that the cancer had spread to the brain from the lungs. With this, we started chemotherapy. This was all looking good and it was really kicking cancers ass. Life was looking normal again. We made it all the way through 2019 with December being one of the best months since diagnosis. She was out with friends and family almost everyday and was beginning to act like herself again. Then the new year hit, we saw a weird decline and some pain, we went to the hospital and they said it was nothing but a pulled muscle. We went on with everything and then around the 22 of January,  it was too much pain to bear. She went back to the hospital with my dad leaving me to run the household and take care of my brother(age 12) we got through the week and went to see her everyday after school. January 30th I went to school and about 30 minutes in I was pulled out and checked my phone with a text from my dad saying “Love you all so much” I knew something had gone wrong at this point. We got to the hospital and we talked about how the cancer had spread beyond the lung and brain and now was in the lower spine, liver, and ribs. She was in unbearable pain and my dad told me she only had a few days left. With this knowledge I had no idea how to react as I am only 14 and the thought of that scared me. That day, I only left her bedside to go use the restroom or eat and the rest of the time I was right there, with her and my dad. We had numerous people come and go and the nurses told us that they had never seen so much love and support for one person. She was heavily sedated but completely out of pain. Earlier that day was the last time I got to talk to her and her last words to me were “hi, love you”, around 9pm, we took her off of her bigger oxogen mask and put her on a regular O2 tube. We knew once we did this, she would only have 4-5 hours left. We did this and those were the last few hours I got with her. At 2:38 in the morning I watched her take her last breath and pass over to the next world. I couldn’t bear the fact I had just lost my mom, someone who has been in my life since the beginning. I was so sad and so was everyone else. I don’t really know how to end this because I can’t think straight and I can’t stop crying so sorry. But I do want to say, don’t take anything for granted. If your friends or family, or whoever has cancer, spend as much time with them as you can. You will be so happy about that in the end. I spent as much time as I could with her and I am happy to be left with those memories I shared with her. I am sorry to anyone who has lost someone and I wish the best of luck to anyone fighting the battle.",2020-02-02 14:55:54

He hid a lot from me to protect me from the bad news. I don’t blame him. I remember he would go days without talking to me because he didn’t want me to see him going bald from the chemo. He didn’t want me to watch him die. He loved me so much. 

I left for California for a few weeks and came back to him in the hospital. I never would have went to California if I knew that was going to be the last time I saw my father outside of a hospital. I didn’t see him for weeks. When I came back, I got the news that he was jaundice. I ran to the hospital and he was so yellow, so skinny, throwing up, and just angry at the world. 

The damn doctors came in and started talking about hospice right in front of him. I was the only one who had faith he’d get better. 

My family tried to talk some sense into me, but I refused to believe he was dying. He’s my father, he raised me, he’s not dying. 

I remember trying to let loose at the club, but was just always constantly looking at my phone. I started crying in the club and just lost it. 

The morning before he died, I gave him a speech, he was so high off drugs but I knew he could hear me. I told him how much I loved him and how I promised to take care of things. My nose started to bleed from crying so hard. I told him to wait for me for when I got out of work. He did. I held his hand and watched him take his last breath. 

Everyone was crying, but I just couldn’t. I cried in my car and screamed on my way back home. I didn’t want to cry in front of anyone. Even at his funeral, I just refused to cry. 

But I just always want to cry. The pain is still there and I miss him more than anything in the world. He made sure I was well taken care of before he left. And I will always be thankful for that. 

I wish I could cry about him to someone, but I just can’t. I want to cry in someone’s lap and just have my head rubbed. But I just can’t.

He was always so proud of me. When everyone doubted me, or thought I wasn’t capable of doing something, he was the one to support my every decision. He knew I could reach the stars. 

And now that I am, he’s not here to see it. I finally got a job that he would be so freakin proud of. I left my toxic relationship which he knew I deserved better. He always knew I deserved better. He would talk about me to his friends as if he was my biggest fan. 

My life is changing and I’m happy, but he’s not here to say “I knew you could do it”. 

Why did it have to be him? I hold no anger towards people who successfully beat cancer, but I get envious of hearing those stories. My father tried, until he just couldn’t. The chemo killed him. 

I know many people feel the pain I’m feeling - which comforts me. I’m not alone. 

I want to see him again, I want to hear his voice again, I want to hear him sneeze again, I want to feel his facial stubble again, I want to smell him again.",2020-01-22 00:46:20

I had to tell my son (8yo) this past weekend that my Dad's situation wasn't good and that he was going to Heaven soon.  My son asked why the medications don't work, because when he takes cough medicine, it works.  I explained that we're doing our best in this world to make better medicines and better ideas for people with cancer.  He told me that he wants to help beat cancer, says he wants to solve it.  God speed little man.

As a family unit we are in a way relieved that he no longer has to suffer, but at the same time extremely sad that he is no longer here.  I don't really know how to react.  Sometimes I'm crying, sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I don't believe it's real.

This is a long story.

I've been hemorrhaging lately, but it always seems to stop itself. Until recently. Earlier this week I got my first transfusion and thought ""whoo boy this was bad"". I was wrong. That wasn't even close.

This time... this hemorrhage... it was different. I've never called 911 before yesterday but I knew I couldn't wait. I couldn't stand and the world was disappearing before my eyes.

I got very scared, and the emts repeatedly asked if I could walk, and if my hubs could drive me. That made my hubs very angry as I was seriously ill. ""But your vitals are fine!"" they said. Not for long assholes.

They walked me down our large flight of steps, one on each side carrying me. I reach the landing, lose consciousness and vomit on myself before regaining consciousness. I have never fainted before. 

By the time I made it into the rig, my vitals had already begun to drop. They told me I was so pale my skin was transparent. For reasons unbeknownst to me, mr ball leg decided to begin hurting more than I've ever experienced. Great timing asshole. 

I have never been closer to death than during that ambulance ride. I could barely stay awake and couldn't even lift my damn arms or head. I honestly thought ""This is it. I'm gonna die next to an asshole emt that didn't even believe me."" Luckily that was not the case. 

I received emergency blood (2 units) and dilaudid. I finally started to feel human again. But of course the hemorrhage was still occurring. 

After staying in this er for 7-9 hours I got transferred to the better equipped hospital and received an emergency cauterization surgery as well as some sort of liquid adhesive. The bleeding is finally under control for now and I'm receiving 3 more units of blood. My veins are all shot and have only 2 good ivs in all the attempts. My arms look like bruised pin cushions. One had to be given under general during surgery. 

I just want to reach a point in my radiation where the bleeding is finally under control. I fear I'll never get there. I apologize, I'm in a dark place today.

I posted about this a couple days ago but I’m back with a request from the community here. My friends' 2 year old son Thomas has been diagnosed with an extremely rare and aggressive form of brain cancer (AT/RT). His prognosis is grim to say the least. His moms are staying with me while he's getting treatment and the whole ordeal just gets more awful and heartbreaking everyday. Over the past week, he’s had 2 neurosurgeries and he’s getting his 3rd surgery tomorrow to remove part of the tumor that’s in his face. Because of COVID, only his 2 parents are allowed in the hospital which is causing them to feel isolated, lonely, and more anxious.

It would be so so so appreciated if you could send him a SmileGram to their hospital room: Here's the link: [https://give.choa.org/site/SSurvey?ACTION\_REQUIRED=URI\_ACTION\_USER\_REQUESTS&SURVEY\_ID=2860](https://give.choa.org/site/SSurvey?ACTION_REQUIRED=URI_ACTION_USER_REQUESTS&SURVEY_ID=2860). His name is Thomas (not posting last name for privacy, the form should accept it without the last name). They are in Room #48 in the PICU. In your message, please include the country/state/city you are writing from. It makes them feel happy to know that people from all over the world are thinking about Thomas and sending them love. They are getting a large world map to put up in his hospital room and pin the locations people have sent him messages from. Reddit community, please help them feel the love and kindness and goodness left in the world! Feel free to share the link with others! Thank you!

This post is for some insight, I lived alone with my mum, she was then moved to a hospice where she peacefully passed.

The NHS and the hospice were amazing, they even sent me a card after she passed, I still can't believe it. We were told 3 months she had left to live, after we were told she passed 2 weeks later. It's no one's fault but just struggling to cope, I still feel in shock but I still live in her house.

I had gamma knife surgery few months ago due to 13 mets found in my brain. My next scan is at the weekend(MRI) and I’m keeping my fingers crossed that it will come back clear. 

Far as I know all the melanoma has gone from the rest of my body ie lungs, liver and groin.

My mom was perfectly healthy. She never got sick, and if she got a cold or something she'd drink some tea and be okay again. I was finishing up school and my Mom was so excited for my summer vacation, and my Dad was the only sick person of the family, with glaucoma and diabetes. Mom always took care of him. 

My Mom's urine started turning yellow, and she'd never had yellow urine. Her entire life it'd been clear, she was always hydrated. She went to the doctor, after not having gone for maybe 6 years. Her eyes started turning yellow, and she got extreme, extreme itching. I was so scared seeing her in pain. 

If any of my classmates saw this they'd make fun of me, but I've always slept in the same bed with my Mom. I know it's weird. When I was 6 I slept in the same bed as my Dad and my Mom, but then Dad got glaucoma and we were scared of hitting his eyes or something. And then I never really grew out of it, no matter how many times I said I would. The comfort of having my Mom near me, especially when I was scared of my Dad going blind, was so nice. She'd tell me stories from her kindergarten days to her college days and we'd just laugh until we fell asleep. I'm so close to my Mom, so when she was itching, it hurt me to see her in pain. 

That's also left me with adjustment issues because once she started having extreme itching, she couldn't be in the same bed as me and I could never sleep on my own. 

Maybe around June 10th she went to the doctor with my Dad, and they immediately sent her to the ER. I was terrified. They sent her to a hospital and she liked it there! I would stay with her in the day, while my Dad had work. Mom didn't work though, she's always been a housewife, so it was easy for her to take a break, but not for me and my Dad. Hell, we didn't know how to use our dishwashing for a little while. 

Then she got diagnosed with cancer, and my world fell apart. I couldn't eat at all. Just looking at food made me want to vomit. Never had I imagined a world without my Mom.

God I did so much research, but it's in the worst place, it's not operable, she can't get a transplant, and she doesn't wanna do chemo because her mother had a bad experience doing chemo for lung cancer. I cried so much. The doctors said she only had 1 year. She always tried to tell me she was gonna live for 5 more years, with the aurvedic medicine that she wanted to try. We're Indian, but we live in the US, by the way. 

She had a surgery to put what I think is called a catheter in her right and life bile ducts. Her blood pressure went down, and she was put in the ICU. She was depressed. I had never seen her so depressed. She could barely eat. And the doctors said she had 3-6 weeks. (It's been like 7 weeks after this and my Mom's still alive) My Dad was debating putting her in hospice. I was broken. I didn't think I could ever live without my Mom, especially not at my age. I'm only 14. 

We somehow got her to go to India. My Dad went with her in business class seats on a flight, which cost him a lot of money, but was most definitely worth it, because she's doing better there. Surrounded by friends and family, and is eating a lot. 

She's in some hospital in India, and I've been able to distract myself from the scary word that is cancer, because every adult is telling me she has like 5 more years, and because it's want to hear, I believe them naively. I still video call her every day though. But, I was hoping maybe they could operate on it there, and cure her, but even there they can't do it. I don't know why I thought it'd be any different. Now they can't do chemo though, she's apparently too weak. She wants to try aurvedic medicine, but that's no replacement for chemo and radiation I don't think. I just don't wanna lose my Mom. I love her so much, and god I hate sounding selfish. Is it selfish to want more time? 

I still can't sleep on my own. It was so much easier with her. I could fall asleep easy then, now I stay up till late hours in the night, I'm literally writing this at 1 am. I really miss my Mom. And I'm such a baby, needing to be in the same bed as her Mom but everything has gotten harder since she hasn't been here for me. 

My Dad has had to rewrite everything, like his will and stuff. He tells me about what'll happen if he and my Mom die, and god that's one of my greatest fears. He was sure of the fact he would die first, but now we can't be sure of anything. I've also debated therapy to cope with everything, but he thinks it'll cause more problems. 

I just want everything to go back to the way it was, but it's too much to ask for. I hope I don't sound selfish. My head is pounding just thinking about her. Everything is so overwhelming. 

I've wrote on this sub-reddit before, this exact same story, but this includes much more detail, and I really needed to get this stuff out, I'm feeling hopeless right now. If anyone knows anything about bile duct cancer that could possibly help my Mom it would help greatly. Or how to cope, that would probably help me. Sorry if this was just a jumble of words, I can't get my thoughts together.",2019-08-11 13:28:48

My mother learned she had stage 4 head and neck baseloid squamous small cell carcinoma in November of 2012. February 2013 she had a radical neck dissection to remove cancer in the tonsil and lymph nodes and cancer strangling the jugular and carotid artery. The surgeon amazingly replaced her trap muscle vein/artery during surgery to her neck. She did chemotherapy after and 30+ rounds of radiation to the neck. She carried on in some pain and discomfort for quite some time and was in remission. For 5 years. November 2017 rolls around and she has a very slight pain in her left hip. Her primary care said it’s nothing to worry about. On a follow up visit to the neurologist she mentioned the pain and the doctor said “What? Really? When is your next oncologist appointment? You should go right away to get it checked out. Bam. 5 years removed and there it is. Metastatic bone cancer to the acetabulum. She did 10 rounds of radiation to the hip in January 2018 and 8 rounds in April 2018. The lesion hadn’t grown. Come around mid 2018 the lesion began to grow. We did 10 treatments of Keytruda til about November 2018. The cancer was not going to listen. The PET scan in December 2018 came back showing the Keytruda was ineffective and the lesion has grown, metastasized to the rib, spine, and now liver. My mom had lost quite some weight during this time. But the news was devastating. My mom has been in excruciating pain for over a year from bone cancer. It is the worst thing ever imagine able. There is no quality of life. The oncologist gave her the option to do chemo or look into hospice care. My mom wasn’t anywhere near healthy or ready to do more chemo to get sick as a dog and not be able to spend what quality time she has left. We chose the hospice route. The scariest part is, this past week or two everything has declined. My mom can no longer get up by herself, she sometimes incontinent, she is now very confused and most certainly hallucinating things. I have learned to go along and not frustrate/irritate her by calling her out that she’s hallucinating. The constant confusion is messing me up terribly. Just today she said she can’t talk and was whispering instead. I check on her many times to make sure she’s okay. I’m always by her side and here for her. It’s just tough knowing I have close family that has no idea what I’m really going through. It’s just my mother and I with my grandmother across the street. Most of my family in another city a couple hours away. I feel like after reading the stages of the end of life cycle, too many seem familiar. She has become unrecognizably skinny although I  try to make sure she can eat as much as she can throughout the day. She’s starting to have a hard time even holding her medicines and swallowing fluids. I’m extremely scared my mom may only have days to live. There’s people in my family who will not be able to comprehend how my loving mother now cannot hold a conversation but rather only responds and peacefully looks at you then says something random. She forgets what she says. I love my mom so much and I’ve been here every step of the way. Fuck cancer. Never wish it on my worst enemy. I just feel dumbfounded on how much has changed and how my mom is now a shell of what she always used to be. I love her with all my heart and soul.",2019-03-18 13:33:47

I started treatment about 2 weeks ago, having my surgery to remove the cancer and evaluate my lymph nodes. Apparently, the primary tumor had grown so rapidly in between my exam and the surgery that what was supposed to be a partial radical vulvectomy turned into a total radical vulvectomy (and bilateral lymph nodes dissection). Because of the more extensive surgery, I was in the hospital for a week instead of 3 days.

My partner was able to take 2 weeks off from work, so he was home the entirety of my hospital stay and the majority of this week (he just went back to work today). When I was in the hospital, he managed to keep up with the house and take care of our son without issue. Since I’ve been home, he’s immediately gone back to his cleaning regimen of “don’t pick anything up until AITAthrowaway90 is so sick of it that she stops asking for help around the house and just cleans it by herself”. But I can’t just do all the housework myself, I just had major surgery and I’m still mostly in a wheelchair. I’ve been able to pick up a few things around the house by rolling around and using my grabber, but essentially it just went to shit. We’ve also gotten into stupid disagreements this week that culminated in him screaming at me for 5-10 minutes and him saying I’m “always negative and make him miserable”. That really hurt, a lot. I always try to encourage him in things he does, tell him qualities I like about him, give him praise, etc, and that’s never reciprocated. The only thing he tells me about how he views me is that I’m negative/terrible/etc and make him miserable (along with typical “love you’s). I ended up having a breakdown and just sobbed.

Well, he went back to work today, so his parents are helping me take care of our child. Things generally were ok, until my physical therapist showed up for our session today. I guess they thought they were quiet enough, but they decided it was a good time to talk shit about how “I’m keeping the house” and “milking” my cancer right now. The thing is, they weren’t quiet, both me *and my physical therapist* heard them. He got a look of horror that they would really sit there and say that, thinking we can’t hear them, then pretend to be all smiles when we ended up walking near them during my session. I feel embarrassed, pissed, and betrayed TBH (they never gave me any indication they thought so poorly of me before).

I’m just tired of all of this. I’ve literally been home for a week and we’re only two weeks into treatment. I still have chemo and radiation I’m going to have to go through, and this apparently is the life I’m fighting to save?

I just want to disappear right now, but I can’t because I can’t even walk down the stairs on my own. Clearly, I’m going to have to re-evaluate the hell out of my relationships if this is what I get to deal with on top of cancer. ",2019-03-03 01:45:29

987,A personal story,66,8jgaze,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/8jgaze/a_personal_story/,27,1526364105.0,"Hi everyone. Just wanted to share my story because I'm really alone and don't have many friends.

2 months ago, I lost my jeep in an explosion, went through a break-up and then was diagnosed with stage II testicular cancer all within the same week.

I found this sub today and am filled with emotion just reading everyone's stories. I'm scheduled to begin chemo next week after I have a port placed in my chest on friday. I'm 23.

Cancer showed me how little I know about this world. How little I know about what's correct or incorrect to do with your life or even your next week.

However, I decided that the purpose of life is to love those around you. And I am sitting here on my laptop at a cafe in seattle with tears welling up and I wish I could hug each and every one of you. I don't know you but I still feel a connection. I don't know what the point of this post was. I suppose I just felt the need to spill my soul. I've been very reserved with my diagnosis, only telling my close friends and my family. I deleted my social media accounts. So, to have a place where I can talk about my diagnosis and not feel like it's some sort of fucked up 'bragging' or dick-measuring contest is so relieving.

The worst part of cancer for me is seeing people's reactions when I share my diagnosis. Why did I have to be the one to bring sadness into someone else's life? I would much rather make someone smile or laugh. :( In that respect, I would rather not tell someone so that they can continue in happiness rather than be emotionally unbalanced because of my life. I do not wish to cause worry in anyone's life.

I don't know why there is so much pain in this world. But all things come to an end and whether we live or die, if we love those around us we are doing the right thing and no one can take that away from us, no one.

I didn't mean to hear this, or know this, but I did, because of where we chose to stop walking, when we did.

A woman in her 30's stood a few feet away and made a phone call, to her husband. I heard her say she got the results, and then she began crying softly. She said, ""This isn't the best way to have this conversation, I wish you were here."" She said, ""It will be different, but we'll get through this."" She mentioned a child at some point. They talked a couple minutes, and she said ""I'll see you when I get home. I love you, too."" 

I wondered what the odds were that I'd be standing in that spot, at that time, and hear that conversation. I wanted to tell her that we were on the same journey, and ask if she had any questions. I wanted to give her a hug. I didn't do any of that, because I was sitting there crying myself, behind my sunglasses, and imagining a time my wife had to make similar phone calls, stuck in my own pain, and I wasn't a picture of encouragement for anyone at that moment.

So, to the lady in the airport, please forgive me for my accidental eavesdropping on your conversation, and forgive me for not at least trying to ease your pain in that moment. And also thank you, for reminding me we're not the only ones going through this, and not the only ones who need help sometimes.

Thanks to everyone here. If I read your post, if I've corresponded with you, or you made a helpful comment. Your stories remind me of my own, and my family's. Thanks for being a place where I don't hear, ""We're praying for you, you're going to beat this thing!"" or any of the other platitudes and bullshit you hear in the real world. I have family and friends I can talk to, but there are things you can't say to them. I don't go to a support group or therapy, this is what I've got. There are so many people who have less than this, who don't have family or friends to help them or their loved ones, and I'm feeling really grateful for you guys today. ",2018-05-04 22:12:48

I was exhausted and had to pee every 45 mins, my neulasta thing was flashing and I just wasn’t feeling myself. So going today and feeling pretty good and like myself showed me how far i’d come since July.

Well before the movie started, there was a preview for “Midnight Sun,” a movie about a girl who is “allergic” to the sun, meaning she can’t go out in the day or she could die. I’m not sure what it’s called, but it’s a real thing. Well low and behold when she’s out at night she meets a guy and they fall in love and her life turns all dandy after sucking for so long.

Now, I know this is not the same thing as cancer, but it reminded me of the Fault in our Stars, how Hazel Graces life sucked until she met Augustus.

But it makes me so mad. Because that’s not what it’s like to be a teenager with a life threatening illness. Maybe for one person, but i bet for the overall population, it’s more pain and isolation than having some guy come and rescue us from all the bad things we’ve been through. 

I wish it were that easy. I wish some guy could come in and make me feel better and stop the depression and the puking and aching and hospital stays. But that’s not reality. at All.

It’s a silly thing to be dumb about but I wish if people were to make movies about teenagers with serious illnesses and diseases, the movie would truly be about our experiences rather than a romanized idea of it. ",2018-03-17 12:04:57

It hasn't been easy but I have been getting weened off medications and all previous tests since engraftment have shown remission.

It really has helped me to have such a great group of people reading and responding to whatever I felt I needed to say at the time.

Unfortunately my father lost his short battle with cancer in the early hours of this morning. It has gutted me. The hospital did let me spend the last few days with him, even though they are in full lock down due to the pandemic, which i am extremely grateful for. I got the call from the staff nurse on his ward this morning. And again, they let go up to the ward and spend a bit of time with him. He was tested for the coronavirus twice during his hospital admission. Both swabs came back negative for coronavirus.

I had to make arrangements with an undertaker this morning, and this is where the problems began. First they wanted £2k upfront. I'm on welfare, so the best i could do was £600 and i applied for help from the UK government. 

Then because of the pandemic, the UK government has put quite a few restrictions on funerals, whether the person died of the the virus or not. I can't have him home and i can't have a viewing at the funeral parlour. I can't have them dress him in a suit, i'm only allowed five family members at the graveside, and we can only have a minister say a few words at the graveside instead of a normal service.

My grandmother is in self isolation due to her age and she is gutted that she can't come to her own son's funeral. And i'm beside myself with grief.",2020-04-08 05:06:57

It’s a really isolating thing; to be in a room with her infusion pump humming and rain pattering on the window. Free from any distractions and alone with your thoughts. It’s like you’re locked in a box with sadnesss. You’re there on your own volition, of course, because obviously it’s *your wife*, but it’s just this thing you can’t escape. It’s why there aren’t good days. The fog of despair is too thick and too persistent. It’s this constant and your mind drifts to surgeries, reoccurrence, and words like *metastasis* and *survival rate*.

10,If your loved one was recently diagnosed or you are struggling with coping- Lessons I have learned to survive the past 2 1/2 years.,25,acyf35,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/acyf35/if_your_loved_one_was_recently_diagnosed_or_you/,5,1546751990.0,"A little background:

My father, who has been the most influential person in my life, was diagnosed with stage 4 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer in the liver) on May 20th, 2015. He was 62.
The average prognosis for his stage was 6 months. We have been unbelievably lucky to still have my father with us, although we know the end can come at anytime.
I’m an only child and my parents have been married for 44 years. The three of us have been each other’s primarily support structure.
10 years ago, I never thought I could have survived this long without going crazy between the grief and the unknowns indefinitely. 
I realized that was not an option. There is no one size fits all solution, but hopefully some of the ways I have learned to deal with it will help someone else. (Also, I work in the medical field which has had some influence on what I have been able to help with.)

This is the mindset I maintain on good/ regular days (forget bad days, it all goes out the window):

1. I refuse to accept any type of specified timeframe for prognosis- which I am glad I did because he beat that timeframe multiple times over. It’s not that I am unrealistic, but life is unpredictable and I see it as not being over until it’s over. I promised my dad when he was diagnosed that I would go to the ends of the earth to find treatment options as long as he wants to continue to fight and will continue to do so for as long as possible.

2. I try very hard to stay focused on today when I think about my dad. Other than doing the research to make sure I always have a plan b option in the back of my mind for him, I try to look at it as today he is alive and when I am with him I stay focused on that moment.

3. I tell myself that I will have all the time in the world to grieve once that final day comes but until then, I am going to be rock strong for him, celebrate any positive news (a day with more energy, a better lab result, anything), and try to put a positive spin on something when he is having a rough day emotionally while still validating his feelings- it’s his right to feel however he feels, but if I can find anything that might make it seem a little less bleak, I will throw it out there.

4. I never question why. I keep it very simple and just accept that it is what it is, I don’t know why, and if I started to question why I would become angry at the injustice of it.

5. When I feel myself becoming overwhelmed with my emotions consistently without a break, I try to take a break when it’s possible. For me, that is usually having a day completely alone to clear my head, do nothing, and try to recenter myself and my perspective. I get out my emotions and I journal my thoughts into my phone. For myself, being an only child and not having anyone else in a similar situation thus far, I have used journaling as my way of getting it out. My mom and I talk about different stuff at times, but I don’t put any of my grief on her- she has more than enough on her plate.

6. I do my best to avoid feeling guilty in any way about anything with my dad. I know he knows how much I love him and that I am there for anything he needs whether he asks or not. This allows me to know that after each visit, if it’s the last time I ever see him, I am going to be okay with our ending.

7. When he was diagnosed I created a bucket list of things I wanted to say or do for him during the time we have left. One by one I have checked those things off my list.

My heart breaks for anyone who is diagnosed or has a loved one diagnosed with cancer. It’s a journey that can’t be imagined unless you actually experience it.",2019-01-06 05:19:50

20,Terminal wife upset with my need for self care. Advice appreciated.,18,fahpi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/fahpi9/terminal_wife_upset_with_my_need_for_self_care/,9,1582861684.0,"Back story: My wife has a terminal cancer diagnosis. Metastasized osteosarcoma and it’s been deemed inoperable, so we’re pursuing proton radiation with Mayo.

We married after her cancer diagnosis and we’re a blended family, both bringing a child into the relationship. I have a 7 year old daughter and she has a 6 year old son. She was a widow, so her son would have no biological surviving parent or other family in the state, so I’m going to legally adopt him. 

We’re 7 months into our cancer journey and it’s been far and away the most exhausting and crushing period of my life. More so than losing a parent or divorce.

Every doctor I’ve talked to, every book I’ve read, and every article I’ve clipped stresses the need for self care. That caregivers need to give themselves time outside of their lives, for them, specifically to refill your own cup. The problem is, with me holding down the household, there’s very little functional time and when I do try and advocate for it with my wife I’m met with hostility and hurt feelings. Insecurities that I’m trying to “get away” from her or hate our “cancer life”.

I realize that her emotions are more about cancer, losing herself, and dying, but it still sucks to not have any piece of my life for me. I wake up, make breakfast for the kids, get them to school, work, balance her needs and support her treatments, and try to ensure she gets as much as I can give her on an empty tank after they go to bed, but it’s still not enough for her.

I’m left in this lonely hellish existence, unable to even go to the gym or step away for a beer. Even if I go into my office to draw or something, I’m trying to “get away” from her. I feel so guilty, beaten down, and lonely, but I’m desperately trying to do my absolute best for her every single day.",2020-02-28 03:48:04

I live 1500 miles away from my family, my brother and mom live in the same town as my dad.

2 weeks ago my dad was admitted to ICU with critically low pulse oxygen reading, I flew here on the first flight the next morning. For 5 days my dad was stuck in ICU with very few answers. He'd been feeling bad for about a month or month and a half but with the Covid situation his doctors wouldn't see him for ""non-emergency care"". After the ICU stay he was thankfully released, I thought I would never see him again. After scans and biopsies the diagnosis was anaplastic thyroid cancer which has spread to his lungs, liver, and bones as well. Treatment was not suggested, nor was it desired by my dad when all outcomes led to death from the disease with decreased quality of life on the way there.

So here I am, 1500 miles from my home with my life on pause while my mom and brother go about their lives as usual and stop by once every couple of days to check in. This has been such a heavy load to bear alone. I've been by my dads side almost every hour of every day since I've been here. I've valued the time we have had together so much but it is just getting so heavy. I gave him his first dose of morphine tonight and he is still uncomfortable. I know he is scared and it is getting so hard to keep my composure and not show him how terrified I am too. I see him get a little weaker every single day and I feel like a part of me is dying along with him. I just don't know how life will ever be the same again. 

I feel so terrible because part of me hopes he is able to let go soon so the pain ends, so that I can start to openly grieve him in a way I feel like I can't while he is still alive because I need to be his rock. I just never thought that being his caretaker would be my responsibility and duty. It's something I never even prepared myself for mentally and it just hit me like a ton of bricks. 

I don't know where I was going with all of this, i just couldn't keep it in anymore...",2020-05-20 12:52:21

He first got it a few years ago and had his bladder removed and after a long recovery from surgery was cancer free for about a year. The best year we had together. One year ago it came back, metastasized in his bones, lungs...all over his body.  He was strong and although in pain he was up and about until the end. When all his treatments failed we knew the end was coming but it's so hard to believe it will actually happen and it can happen so fast. Three days before he died he was walking, talking, joking around.  I don't know why I'm writing this here except that I'm lonely right now thinking about what I wish we'd have done differently. He taught me in the past year how to take care of things around the house - how to wire a light fixture, fix the toilet, run and maintain the lawn equipment. I wish I had recorded those lessons. I wish I had his laugh to listen to. I wish I could see the proud but worried look on his face as I used his chainsaw. Why didn't I think to record his voice and expressions? Why didn't he leave me a letter or a note?  We had a long time to do these things but still thought there would be time. Sometimes the end jumps out from around a corner you don't expect and everything speeds out of control and it's over. If there are things you want to do or talk about please don't wait. Make videos.

He’s 30 years old. He has a rare form called Choriocarcinoma. Abdomen, lungs, liver, spine and brain all effected. 


He went through his first chemo regiment March- May 2019. It started out rough, in the ICU coughing up blood. But, the next three rounds he really bounced back. His tumor marker kept dropping, his tumors shrinking. We were thrilled


Getting ready for surgery in July, to remove residue masses. Then, seizure. He relapsed in the brain.


We leave our jobs, both self employed business owners. To move to NYC so he can get high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant at MSK.
It was so hard, but he did it, we did it. August -October 


He gets his surgeries, November - December, no live cancer found. He gets a PET scan, no cancer found. We are so certain he made it through.


Fast forward to now. 10months since his last chemo. His tumor marker skyrocketed. July it was 0, last Thursday 14,900. 


He didn’t want to look at the report, he wanted to wait till we talked to the oncologist. But, I had to look. It’s been 4 days that I’ve known and he hasn’t. We were told a relapse would mean no more cure, just trying to extend life.


His hip has been bothering him, keeping him up at night. He stretches all the time, calling it muscle pain. I know what it is. It’s a tumor in his pelvis. 


Everyday this fast growing cancer is getting worse. It’s been the weekend, then today a holiday so his oncologist office is closed. I can’t tell him but I’m worried he won’t get the palliative chemo in time. I’m worried he won’t even take it once he finds out.

I do all of it. I work at home, I care for him, I clean, I do the meals, etc.  Recently he became incontinent, and now he is down to 160 lbs after weighing over 300 when first diagnosed.  He had a PET scan, and new cancer has been found in his lung and his colon.

He asked me if he was dying, and I was honest and told him that I thought he may be, but there is always hope.  Now he doesn't want to talk about it, but goes back and forth about not wanting to live like this and wanting to fight.

I know it is his choice, I KNOW he has to make a decision, but he can no longer walk by himself, he can no longer dress himself, clothe himself, change his pull up, change the bed, make his meals, ANYTHING.  I am no sure what to do, although I have talked to the SW and she is sending in household help so that I get some time.  The VA is also sending in a home health aide (thank GOD for the VA)

So what do I do now? We have discussed Hospice, but he is not ready for it yet, but if he can't put weight back on, they WILL put the PEG back in.

Jenah had cervical cancer years before but had a hysterectomy to remove that cancer.  A lobectomy showed that this was not the same cancer that had been in her lady parts.  In August she came to Knoxville and we spent some time together, she was not very mobile due to her condition.

I did my best to be supportive.

She went back to Wisconsin and we talked almost daily.  She went into the hospital after a new trial of a cancer treatment sent her immune system into a massive attack on all of her body.  They gave her immunosuppressant medications and she came back.  Several of her Oncologists said they were wondering how they were able to talk to her, that she should be dead by all rights.  She laughed it off saying that she was weird like that.  From the hospital, they moved to a palliative care center for her to recover.  It eventually became hospice care, but I was never told this.

She said she loved me, that she always wondered why I had stayed in this relationship with her after she developed this cancer.  She told me that she was having a friend send me a few things that I had sent her and given her, a stuffed animal T-Rex, a t-shirt and a few other things.  I asked her if she knew how it was going to happen, was she going to be put on higher dose pain killers to make her comfortable.  She said she was not aware of that nor was she aware of a lot of other things.  I kept myself together as best that I could and said my goodbyes.  After that call ended, I cried.  I ugly cried and screamed and yelled why.  Then I asked whatever greater being there was to not let her die this day.

My (F30) fiancé (M29) was diagnosed with stage 4 testicular cancer end of February. Now most people respond to that as “well if you are going to have any cancer, that’s the one to have”. But he is one of the 1% of testicular cancer patients that has pure Choriocarcinoma. Extremely aggressive and much less responsive to treatment. He also didn’t have a mass he could have felt, it skipped right over his actual testis and to a mass around his aorta, his liver and lungs. 

Got off to a shit start, hospitalized (total of 2 weeks) and started chemo within days, on 15L of oxygen and the oncologist told us she wasn’t sure he was going to make it through the first round of chemo. 
He did, and he recover well, really well, as much as you can for going through chemo. He even went to the gym a couple times between each of his 4 rounds of chemo.

When he finished the fourth round we started making weekly visits to Sloan Kettering to get a surgery to remove the mass in his abdomen around his aorta. They wanted to wait to see the tumor marker drop to normal and it slowly was. 6 weeks later it’s still dropping, almost normal, so they schedule the surgery for 2 weeks later. We tell everyone our August 17th wedding is still on and start getting everything going again.

5 days before the surgery, we get a phone call, his marker is going up, surgery is canceled. This means he has to do high dose chemo with stem cell rescue, in NYC. We live 4 hours away, we have to leave our self employed small businesses, our home, our community and cancel our wedding. We were crushed.

3 days later, we get home from the gym, I hear a bang. He’s on the ground having a seizure (5 mins early he would have been driving us home). I’m not sure if I’m watching him die in front of me. Call 911. In the ER, they find new Mets to the brain that bled, his cancer likes to do that.

He was put on lots of steroids for brain inflammation, along with other anti seizure. He gets radiation to the brain and we continue our weekly visits to Sloan Kettering in NYC, but now to get everything in order for high dose. His tumor marker went from its low at 8 now back up to 433. 

The steroids are making him miserable, but when they tried to lower the dosage he got neurological signs of inflammation in his brain all over the left side of his body. He’s gained 20lbs, breaking out, depressed. Delayed onset of original chemo symptoms just started, bad neuropathy in both feet. 

Next week we move to NYC and live in the hope lodge for 4-6 months.

I’m scared, I’m heartbroken. I had a really rough time before I knew him. Lost my dad to cancer when I was 20, in an abusive relationship from 17-27. I worked really hard to get myself where I was when I met him, he’s amazing, smart, attractive, all the things I didn’t think I deserved in a partner, but we were going to get married and life was really good, for the first time. 

I’m so scared to loose him. I’m scared to what life looks like on the other side of this. I’m scared of what side effects and health issues he’ll have from treatment. We won’t be able to have biological children. 

I know there is no point in saying it’s not fair, it never is. Honestly, we try and stay really up beat about the whole thing, but I know we are both hitting rock bottom right now. 

I know this was long, I just needed to “say it out loud”.

She completed her first round of chemotherapy and is experiencing sweats, nausea and vomiting, and overall tiredness. It's only been two weeks of me holding her hair back, monitoring her temp, and coordinating future doctor appointments and I wish it wasn't me dealing with all this. I have a younger sister who I have to watch over now. Not that I didn't before, but fixing her hair in the morning for school, speaking with her teachers regarding my mom, and everything in between now falls on me. 

Again, I wish I didn't have to and I feel so, so guilty for feeling this way.

To provide a bit of a backstory, my mom's first language is Spanish. English is a very distant second and growing up, I always had to translate for her. I always had to accompany her to school meetings, doctor appointments, to the bank, anywhere you can think of, to help her. Now, as a 20 year old, I started to dream about moving away from home... of finally, finally being on my own without having to worry about my mom or sister. At least, not worry in the way that you do when you live together. 

As for my dad, he's not around. Before the cancer diagnosis, he was kicked out of the house. My mom, after almost 21 years, finally had to courage to do it. His extracurricular activities had always affected my family and I, but for the past couple of months, he had gotten sloppy. Or maybe he didn't care to hide them anymore. That's a Pandora's box for another post or, possibly, a therapy session.

My significant other isn't in the picture either. He's been distant, both figuratively and literally. He's a military guy going through training, but due to Memorial Day weekend, he has a break and is currently at the beach. We've been together for almost three years. He has been my rock through school, family drama, and every dot in between. I bring him up only because I'm angry (not sure if that's the right word)... I'm home taking care of my mom waiting for him to reach out... only to find that he posted a beach picture on Snapchat. 

My friends are having parties to celebrate their graduation. I would've been a graduate too, but I failed my final. For reference, my mom was diagnosed on Friday and my exam was the following Monday. 

Anger may be it. I'm angry at my dad for not being the lead caretaker. I'm angry at my sister for not being older. I'm angry at my boyfriend for having fun. I'm angry at my friends for graduating when I failed. I'm angry at myself for making my mom cancer's about me. But most of all, I'm angry at the world, or God, or whatever/whomever for my mom's cancer.

My mom deserves so much more than what she's been given in life. She grew up poor. She's been sexually assaulted. She had my asshat of a dad as partner for longer than I've been alive. She's never been valued the way I think she deserves to be. (Tears are coming.) 

Her and I were planning on buying a house as soon as I graduated and got a job. We planned vacations to take over the summer. I was beginning to imagine a light at the end of tunnel for her and boom. 

Throughout all of this, no one has asked ""What took you so long to see a doctor?"" or ""Didn't you have any symptoms?"" And the answer is no. At least, not any red flag symptoms. My mom was constipated here and there, but there was never any pain or blood in her stool... it wasn't until a few months ago that she began to experience some abdominal pain. We went to her primary, an ultrasound was scheduled, and her and I were waiting for the follow-up appointment. Before we could get to it, she started experiencing some chest and back pain. I took her to the ER and a few hours later, we knew.

I'm angry for what's to come. Between what I've learned in school and (responsible) Google'ing, I know my mom is going to die sooner rather than later. In the hospital, they expressed how important it was to have hope and to be strong. I don't share what I know with my mom because I don't want to freak her out. I want her to have hope. I hold on to spending as much time as I can with her. Her and I started getting our ducks in a row as soon as she was discharged (i.e. completing an advance directive). Even if she does liver past what's expected, what will her quality of life be? Living is so much more than breathing. I love her and, despite everything I wrote, I'm happy to be the one to be there for her.

Typing all of this was a bit cathartic. I didn't realize I was holding onto so much until I started crying halfway through it. I don't know how much more I'll post, but thank you Internet for providing this safe place.",2019-05-25 10:20:39

So I watched everyone like a hawk when they cooked.

Now that's everyone has gone back home I'm proud to say that I have learned how to cook a few flipino dishes for my mother.

Such as okoy, and manudo. My aunt even sharing that these were my grandmother's recipes. Unfortunately my grandma has dementia  now so I feel very thankful I am still able to learn her recipes.

Me and my siblings were all born in Canada, and unfortunately I never took an interest in learning how to cook food from the Philippines. However for my mom, to make her happy I would learn how to jump over the moon if I could.

My wife has metastatic breast cancer and an anaplastic astrocytoma (brain tumor). They are both primary cancers. She's currently being treated for both and things seem to be going well (it's still too early to know, but her oncologist said the early signs are good so far).

What is not going well is her mental state. She is clearly depressed. Mood swings, she'll be happy in the morning and severely depressed by lunch. Lack of interest in doing anything other than sitting on the couch. Over and under-sleeping. All signs point to her needing help. I've brought it up several times, as have several of her doctors, but she refuses every time. She says she doesn't need someone to try and make her feel happy all the time when she knows she will die. She has convinced herself that she will die soon (despite her oncologist's optimistic outlook) and would rather spend her remaining time just sitting on the couch feeling sorry for herself.

But what can I do? I'm almost tempted to set up an appointment without her knowing and trying to force her to go to a counselor, but that just seems like a recipe for disaster. But neither can I keep going on like this. Dealing with the appointments and treatment stuff is hard enough, but having her shout at me, give me the silent treatment, or tell me she would rather be dead is making it ten times worse. 

I feel beaten down with all of this. What can I do to help my wife? What can I do to help myself? Please, I'm begging for some advice on how to handle this",2019-09-11 03:09:14

And that's ok. I cant help how I feel.  And I apologize for the length. I have to lay it all out in order to hopefully get some advice....

On Good Friday 2018, my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. Terminal.  The following Tuesday, we had her first oncology appt. In a matter of just a few days, the doctor gave mom her options. No treatment =a few months. Treatment =maybe a year. 

She asked me what I would do. I was very honest and told her I would take what God had dealt me, and have a few great months and let nature take its course (if not end my own life to not suffer) 

We talked about quality of life. And how that was the only thing I would find acceptable if I was in her shoes. And i take that sentiment VERY seriously. 

Now understand, we have lost several family members to cancer. We all watched my grandmother waste away over several years. Not something I can forget, nor do I care to witness again. 

My moms choice was to go through the treatment and fight. Great. Told her we would he by her side all the way through...and we have. 

I wont bore you with all the details of dealing with her refusing to take meds (yet claiming she wants to get every moment she can in this world) or about the aggressive treatments and all that. 

Which leads to where we are now....

About 8 weeks ago, my mom became bedridden due to a stroke (this is an important detail)  With the stroke, she lost her ability to control her right leg. So...the cancer didnt do this. The stroke did. But if you ask the oncologist, he will claim the chemo treatments are what caused the stroke. Of course all treatment has stopped. 

She is home and under hospice care. And they are wonderful! 2 nurse visits a week. And a caretaker 3 days a week to bathe her and change her bed clothes. Other than that...its all on us 3 children. 

So...this is the schedule I've been living for the last 8 weeks.....

I'm with her from Friday afternoon until midnight Sunday night ( with no relief). At midnight Sunday night,I drive 2.5 hours to work. I work until 9am in a very physical job. I then drive 2.5 hours back to mom, arriving around noon. Take care of her all day lie down at 8pm, get up at 10pm to give her meds, and lie back down. Up again at midnight and start the drive again.  I do this back and forth Monday-Friday  

In between all of that, I change her, feed her and her live in boyfriend who is now showing signs of dementia ( so I take care of him too), 5 cats, 1  dog (which is not housebroken), laundry, housework, etc. It is relentless and endless. 

Now I also have a second business that most can be done by laptop. But I do have meetings to attend. So I squeeze them in with help from my siblings. They generally take the overnight shift so I can work. (And let me tell you that they live 20.mins away....not 2.5 hours like me ) 

I looked at the calendar the other day, and realized I have slept in my own bed only 10 nights in the last 8 weeks. 

I am beyond exhausted! I'm so exhausted that there are times I cant sleep at all. I've gone as much as 36 hours with no sleep. This is how bad it has gotten. 

I've fallen asleep behind the wheel several times. And thankfully I've not wrecked. 

2 weeks ago, I sat down with my siblings and told them no more! They lived closer and needed to step up and do more.  I also explained that if I didnt take care of myself, I wont be around much longer to take care of mom. I'm going to get killed in a car accident. I see it coming! 

So now I get Tuesdays and wednesdays off.  Between them and a couple of other family members, I get 48 straight hours free. Which I use to try and maintain my own home and work. 

But I am so angry! I am finding myself holding some serious contempt for my mom. In my mind, her decision to do this was a futile one. Yes, she has lived past the year mark. But at what expense? She has ZERO quality of life. She is stuck in that bed on a catheter/diaper. Dealing with bed sores. And the only thing she can do for herself is talk and feed herself. 

Everything else is on us kids. (Mostly me)  

How do I get past feeling so bitter that her decision has led ME to have no quality of life. I was so clear at the beginning how I feel about this issue. And I dont know how to cope anymore. I swear I feel like giving up. I'm so exhausted. 

And there is no end in sight. Under hospice care, we no longer get medical tests. We have no idea where the cancer stands, nor how serious her health is.  Which makes it worst! I cant even tell my brain that we only have to do this for so long. 

I know all of this may sound selfish. But it's how I feel. And I know it sounds horrible. 

I thought about seeing a counselor. But where would I find the time? Seriously...I have none. 

I'm so damned tired.",2019-08-31 18:34:51

My boyfriend has cancer and has been doing treatment since April. Things are going very well and he may be getting surgery soon. We have been friends for years and started dating November of last year. He was not feeling good for a long time and finally got diagnosed in March of this year. So I've been by his side through all of it. 

What that looks like is talking to his team, helping with his parents, and helping him as much as possible. I'm also still working full time as my job hasn't been shut down. I've also been doing school and now studying for a licensing test. I've moved in that time too. So it's a lot.

What's really hurting me is days like yesterday. He got chemo on Thursday and usually he feels like shit for the next week, of course. I saw him on Friday night and brought him Lego (I do that after every round), then took him to the store so we could get something to make for dinner. Everything was good and I told him I would come over Saturday (yesterday) to be there for him and study for my test on Wednesday. We've been talking about that for the past couple weeks since I scheduled it. He was supportive of me studying with him there and bouncing things off him because that helps me remember the things I've learned. Of course I would not bother him with it if it ended up that he felt like shit and couldn't handle that.

So yesterday I go for a run in the morning/early afternoon thinking he's probably sleeping and not feeling well. When I get back he tells me he's gone out of town for a drive and to walk around another town. I was extremely hurt and upset that he would do that without me and that he just pretended to forget that the plan was for me to come over and study and then watch a movie together. I told him it feels like I am always there for him when he feels like shit and then when he feels good I'm left out. He also works on the weekends he's feeling good. So the last time we did anything fun out in public was weeks ago. 

He got really defensive, said I ruined his day, made him feel like shit, etc. I am trying my absolute best to support him at all times. I know I'm doing a pretty good job. And I do support him doing things he enjoys when he feels good. He has every day of the week to do things without me and the days I have off that he feels good he goes and does something that I have wanted to do with him since the whole thing started. 

I told him how I felt and he semi apologized. I also apologized that my first reaction wasn't that I was happy he was feeling good but honestly it wasn't my first reaction. I am still struggling not to feel underappreciated and unloved by this. He tries to tell me I need to do my own things too. And I do, but I want to spend time with him when he's good too and I don't think that's unhealthy. I really, really don't want to feel this way. 

Any help really appreciated. I'm just sad and I'm scared for what our relationship is going to look like when it's done (God willing) and he's better.",2020-07-20 02:45:00

To say he's in a very high risk group should he get COVID-19 is obviously an understatement. As such, we've been taking social distancing very seriously, as well as limiting our time outside of our home to walks around our neighborhood and quick trips to the grocery store (usually we use their pick up service). Thankfully neither of us have to physically report to work, so the only people we have close contact with on a regular basis is our immediate family (my husband, our son, and myself).

Unfortunately, this past Monday, my husband was rushed to the ER after a routine CT scan of his lungs indicated that he had a massive amount of fluid just outside of his right lung. He'd been having severe pain and a nasty cough for the past several weeks, but his saturated oxygen levels were good, so his doctors just told him to take it easy and increase his pain meds.

Since he had so much fluid and his heart rate was dangerously high, my husband spent both Monday and Tuesday nights in the hospital, before finally being discharged yesterday afternoon. As I'm sure you all understand, I was a nervous wreck the whole time, and couldn't wait for him to get back home to what I'd like to believe is our protective bubble (aka home).

Fast forward to today. My husband was feeling much better having had the fluid drained (nearly 4 liters) and having had a decent night's sleep at home. His parents live about 30 minutes away and his mom is a former nurse, so she offered to let him borrow a portable device that measures both O2 and heart rate (my brain is blanking on the correct name) since my husband was still concerned about his vitals. Before leaving our house, my husband arranged for his mom to set the medical equipment OUTSIDE, so as to maintain proper social distancing. He'd even offered to talk to his parents through the glass in one of their front windows.

Since I didn't feel my husband was up for driving, I drove with him and our son to his parents' place. When we got there, my son and I stayed in the car because hey, all my husband had to do was pick up a small medical device and get back into the car, right?

Nope! Not only did his mom NOT put the item outside, both she AND my father in law came outside, walked RIGHT UP TO my husband, and TRIED TO HUG HIM!!!

I nearly jumped out of the car and body slammed them both to the ground! FFS! The dude has stage 4 cancer!! WTF were they thinking?! And if even if they were magically 100% sure they themselves didn't have Coronavirus, or had been recently exposed, my husband had literally just left the hospital yesterday! What's to say he himself hadn't been exposed?

Sorry for the rant, I guess I'm just feeling super protective of my husband and family right now.",2020-04-17 12:42:22

It's not good. The cancer is on my husband's spine and has significantly reduced his motor function over the last week. We're going straight to treatment so hopefully the damage won't be permanent or get worse.

We're still incredibly lucky. We're in an area with great hospitals and doctors, the same area I was treated for my cancer, we have great insurance, and some other benefits that will help cover our deductible and max out of pocket. I also work in the medical insurance field, so I have lots of close connections with people who are experts at navigating this information and medical claims. My husband and I also have lots of close family (we both hit the in-law jackpot) who are more than willing to help out with all sorts of things including keeping us company at the hospital, helping us move, and prep our new house.

Not sure why I'm posting this but I feel the need to share.. my mother has been fighting breast cancer for over 21 years. She was first diagnosed while she was still working as a pre-k teacher, lumpectomy and radiation took care of it. 5 years went by, no worries. Oops, another lump, lumpectomy on her other breaths, radiation, done.

Then 12 years went by.. though we had this fucking disease beat.. the doctors said the cancer won't kill her, it will be something else. My parents lived their lives in retirement, went traveling, saw both of their granddaughters born. Cancer never crossed our minds.. 

The past 4 years though...... horrible. Cancer reared its head and basically said,, I'm back, go to hell, you are not beating me. One mastectomy and my moms first bout with Chemo, at 79.. then the other breast and intensive chemo rounds.. she still had the will to fight and make her dream trip on the Queen Mary II across the ocean and a family vacation in Europe.. thought we had it beat again..

9 months ago, my sister took my mom to the emergency room in massive pain. It had metastasized, stage 4, game over.. except in her mind.. 9 months of chemo can break the will of anyone. My mom just decided tonight to stop the treatments, and start palliative care and hospice. We thought we were ready for this.

When we talked it was no bad vibes.  You don't feel like anyone thought they were better than the other or because you was white and I was black. When my daughter was at the Benson Center I was on a mental and emotional roller coaster. Daily I met and conversed with many people. Nightly I ate with different families, so you know the food was different everytime lol. But I did learn that eating vegan ain’t so bad. In every verbal or nonverbal encounter the feeling was always mutual. We knew each other was scared, fearful, tired, cried out with no sense of direction. 

I felt good hugging other mothers and sharing my fears, tears and hugs with them. I opened up on Facebook cancer groups and I learned so much. Because no matter how far fetch it seemed.... somebody somewhere went thru it before me or they read something about it or just a simple word of encouragement.

I'm trying to stay positive, to be cheerful and to create memories doing things together, but this feeling is not going away. How do you cope with this?",2019-12-02 03:55:24

My husband is having a craniotomy in a couple of hours so we can get  diagnosis of the mass in his brain. Technically we dont know its cancer. But it is.  I am terrified.   He is my rock and I'm struggling to be his rock.  I dont know if I'm doing enough to support him. 

I have friend and family for support which is awesome but as much as they help, they just dont understand. I guess I'm looking to vent to some internet strangers that understand all too well.

Yep, 19 years old. Too young statistically but it happened. Lumpectomy, all good. That is, until 1999. Breast cancer again, other side, then cervical cancer that spread to her colon. Another lumpectomy, and one chemo session for the colon. Moved to a new state, had to wait 365 days for insurance because of a pre-existing condition. A year later, cervical cancer was stage 0, colon cancer gone... poofed...miracled. A few years later, cervical cancer was progressing, so surgery for that. Another few years later, melanoma again. Second time. Then 5 years ago, breast cancer again, stage 2. Double mastectomy, chemo, radiation then hormone treatment. Three TIAs stopped that after three weeks, so more surgery to remove the last of her lady parts. Then reconstruction, twice. Less than 2 years ago, it's back, stage 4. Did treatments for a year, still spreading. Had to take a break because of side effects almost killing her. Got on a clinical trial but had to drop before starting due to pain from cancer spreading to her spine and neck. Radiation to decrease pain for a bit. Went on hospice for a few weeks, found the strength to fight again. Found another trial that looked very promising, targeted a specific protein. After 1 cycle she didn't feel worse, but didn't feel better.  Ok, maybe we'll just get a little more time. Doc visit at start if second cycle, had to go to ER due to facial numbness. That's 3 weeks ago. Found out the cancer was in her brain. So she literally had cancer head to toe...bone mets, liver mets, lung mets, lymph nodes...everywhere. Doc stopped the trial, back on hospice. Yesterday morning she transitioned to her next journey, peacefully and pain free, with out oldest daughter, youngest granddaughter, and me holding her. Hardest day of my life. Last night and this morning were hard, too, not having her beside me in bed when I fell asleep and woke up, not having her ask for ice cream at 3AM because that was all she could swallow, not hearing hear breathing, wondering if that was her last breath.

First post so please excuse me if I'm out of line. My father was diagnosed with bladder cancer last year. To paint a picture, I was in Italy last October, just proposed to my girlfriend and called my folks to let them know ow the good news. I was met with a rather flat tone, and on face time I knew something was up. They didn't want to say anything when I tried pushing it and said to ask when I got home. Soon as I touched down back in AUS a week later I asked, and that's when they told me. My dad had actually found out weeks prior but they didn't want to ruin mine and my fiance's trip. 

Fast forward 6 months, and he has managed to beat the bladder cancer,. Ur w strange growth has appeared I his leg. Within 2 weeks this growh is not over 8"" in eize. The doctors then tell us that his cancer from the bladder has spread and is metasratic. This absolutely crushes our family, as we had high hopes of my dad over coming this. 

After receiving this news, my fiance's dad is diagnosed with colon cancer in the same week.

I've been trying to.be strong for my family for so long now, and my partners family, but I now feel like it's eating me up inside. 

We just celetebrwted what may be my dad's last Christmas. He is only 64. He gave my mum a gift of a bear that has pre.recored messages. The message he left was that of someone that had come to terms with the fact that when they listen to the message, they know that person is gone.


I'm really struggling now to come to terms with what has been dealt to our family. My father has been there mostotal individual k have ever known, yet he has been dealt the absolute worst cards in life. 

How exactly do people try to come to terms with things like this?",2017-12-26 17:52:49

In good health, worked out everyday, was very lean and I was happy that he would help me get healthy too.  Well, first years were great.  He ended up having swelling in the side of his neck.  We went to the ER and they did a scan to find he had throat cancer.  He goes through all the radiation and chemo and late last year was diagnosed as cancer free.  OH MY GOD, all the hard work paid off.  He goes a couple of months having scans every couple of months to make sure everything is good.  They schedule him to have his port removed from the chemo and looking to remove his trach and stomach tubes.  Last week, his stomach started swelling.  I decided to convince him to go to the ER and have them look at it.  They drained the fluid and looked at a bump on his side and started to run test.  Now they come back with he has cancer in his spine/hip, lungs, and possible the liver.  WTF!

I am looking for some answers. I am going through cancer treatment for the second time in 2 years and it has been tough. My partner is struggling with it really hard. Therefore i have some questions for caregivers.

- did you ever think about leaving your ill partner because it all got too much?

- did you struggle with the chance of not being able to reach your own life goals and if yes, how did you cope with this?

- what did your partner do to make it less difficult for you?

- how old are/were you?

A little backstory: we have been together for almost 7 years now and i got cancer 2 years ago. I recovered pretty well and my partner could cope because he thought it was over. But it came back a few months ago. He is in his mid 20's and just starting a demanding career while doing his masters. It is pretty tough but it is his one and only dream. He doesn't feel ready to take on such a big responsibility as taking care of a sick partner now his life is not yet stable enough. He feels like He has to choose between his own life, or caring for me. The reality is not so black and white but that's how he feels. And he makes me feel guilty every day for holding him back from pursuing his ambitions. He tells me that if this happened 10 years later it would have been much easier to be there for me.

I really wonder if someone went through something like him and how do people handle this. I don't know whether to stay with him or to break up with him because i seem to be ruining his future.

98,I Can't Believe It's Happening Again,8,io23ba,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/io23ba/i_cant_believe_its_happening_again/,4,1599487313.0,"Sorry for the novel. Got no one else to tell. 
Welp. Here I am. My first husband who I met in 2002, we got married three years later because we were in love. He started having health problems in 2009. 

It got so bad for him that he could barely walk. He was in constant pain. He had to do his marine mechanic business from the couch with people that he got to work for him. 

We applied for disability for him but they just kept dragging their feet, even after we got a lawyer.

We didn't know what was wrong. He had blue cross insurance so he was always at the doctors. Pain pills they prescribed barely masked his pain. I had to take care of him because he was essentially bedridden.

One time i took him to his drs appointment, i had to use a wheelchair to get him there. The Dr, an older man, made my husband wait an hour past his appointment while he was writhing in agony. When the dr came in he said ""Im sorry Mr Harris but there is nothing I can do for you.""

Fast forward to us losing our home because of all this. We ended up living in his brother's motorhome far outside of town. Then one day he told me to call an ambulance. I did, and the next day when I went to see him I got the news that my husband had stage 4 lung cancer. He was put in hospice after two days. By then it had gotten to his brain. He was gone 3 days after his diagnosis. 

I was heartbroken. My husband gone at age 54. No working vehicle, no money but the 700$ left in his bank.. And a 24 mile walk (12 each way) to the nearest store. When i ran out of food I started out at 7am and got home almost at 9 at night. 

I was able to leave that place after a few months thanks to a loan I got from a friend who helped me get a place in the city. Even then things weren't easy. I eventually lost the place and couch surfed. 

I ended up waiting for three years to get his disability backpay which sucked because during that time I was homeless.

In 2014 I had a better job and a place to live, and a new love interest. He was 24 years older than me - but we still had much in common. We enjoyed each others company.

And boy he loved to drink. So much so that his week long benders became unbearable. 

I moved out for 8 months so he could get his life together. During that time, he got his last DUI. I agreed to come stay with him if he put my name on a cheap vehicle, and I would drive him wherever he needed. So he sobered up, and was better for a time. I decided to give him a chance. We got married in 2018, and got a newish car that I just love. 

Things seemed great until December of last year. He slipped into old habits and began drinking until he was in a stupor. I learned to stop trying to fight him and just leave the house when he got like that. Except it got serious, things just weren't ""normal"" and I called an ambulance for him. 
 

I had to call them again a month later, and this time I told the nurses not to release him despite what he said or did. They let him go anyway, and somehow he stumbled home. I found him at the neighbors, having a beer. 

The third time I called an ambulance for him they gave him tests for his liver..and they found a large mass. Finally! Some help. He got it checked and he was diagnosed with primary liver cancer in february, a week after our anniversary. 

Its not looking good for him. Hes 66yo. He was cured of hep c many years ago but drinking really weakened his liver. Hes not taking to treatment very well. Its not growing but its not shrinking either. 

So i just can't believe Im going through this again. Im making sure he talks with his family often. Im angry that he wont get to see his granddaughters grow up. And i try to keep him updated on appointments. But its like being with someone who's not all there..with all the meds he's on. It's not looking good. 

At least my husband now has made sure that I won't be broke and homeless after he's gone. He wanted to make sure of that for a long time even before his cancer.

What a punch in the gut. Two marriages, stolen by cancer. 

Thanks for reading my story. Sometimes I just want to cry but that wont help a bit. Someone has to be strong.",2020-09-07 14:01:53

I think we can all agree cancer is a vile disease that has taken the lives of too many lovely people out there...
My name is Hailee and I’m a cancer survivor. March 16, 2021 will mark one decade of remission for me, and I thank the stars every day. 
I’ve come here on recommendation of my boyfriend to tell you a bit about my story...
I was 14 when I was diagnosed with aggressive osteogenic sarcoma, and my life was flipped on its head.
Going through the hardest year of my life, I made a lot of deep realizations about myself and the Illness. I had started writing prose pieces that gave people some insight into my life as a teenage cancer patient, and little tricks I used to get by.
A few years after completing chemotherapy, my mother and I decided to combine our minds to bring a book to you, that we hope can touch the lives of someone in need of it.
You’ll find chapters from both patient and caretaker perspectives, with tips at the end of each segment. Tips for patients, caretakers, and friendly people who aren’t sure how to lend a hand.
I felt weird about making this post initially because I didn’t want it to seem like a huge “look at me” ordeal... I just kind of wish I had something like this when I was going through it . The only reason we made the book was to hopefully help a family who needs it like ours did, and if I don’t tell people it’s out there no one will know.
If you are interested in reading more about our story and how we tried to make the impossible possible every day, follow us on social media, or grab a copy for you or someone you care about! 
Thank you for you time and much love!

I broke down crying in my kitchen as my godmother and her son came in ( they run a daycare out of home and have emergency training), they relented against my grandfather and moved her flat on her back and with a couple compressions she started a hoarse breathing pattern. 

Emergency services arrived and now I'm in the hospital waiting room. I deferred to others against my better judgement and entered a panic state, which could have cost her life.  

This is my 3rd caregiver situation after my maternal grandfather and mother, and I've never lost grasp of a situation so poorly,  I feel ashamed.",2019-12-17 10:37:32

My husband was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer in 2012. Now, yesterday, my father in law was diagnosed with prostate cancer.

Luckily it was found very early. There's a 94% survival rate, but he will have to go through chemo and radiation.

This man has been my lifesaver over the last two years. He retired, and since then has been bringing my husband to most of his appointments since I work full time and am in graduate school. He comes by the house to watch movies with my husband and cheer him up. We've tag-teamed hospital visits and bad mental health days. 

I feel like a horrible person, but I just keep realizing how I've lost this support system. Obviously, my FIL needs to focus on his own health. My MIL will need to use her time off to bring her husband to appointments and care for him versus being able to help us. We'll need to find alternative rides for my husband to appointments because I don't have enough PTO to bring him and I can't afford to take time unpaid. My parents are both around and happy to bring him, but he gets panicked about going with anyone other than me or his dad, anticipating car sickness, panic attacks, etc. and doesn't want to ""embarrass himself"". 

I feel like I'm in an impossible scenario where I need to take over the parts of caretaking that I had given up, also care for the additional anxieties and mental health concerns my husband will have to watch his father face cancer, supporting my MIL as she has to watch both her son and husband dealing with this, and somehow still doing my job and finishing school. Oh, and not have a mental breakdown myself.

We’re seeing my husband’s oncologist after his latest CT came back. His osteosarcoma has spread. 

He’s 29, and was first diagnosed with osteosarcoma in his right hip in 2013. 

As of late, he’s had a lot of pain all over his body for a few months now. CT came back recently and showed several smaller spots in 5 different places in his upper body and a larger spot in his other hip. 

We’re trying to feel positive and feel like we caught this at a good point all these years later, just nervous and he’s in a lot of pain. The meds are helping but we’re just anxious about tomorrow. 

Feels good to share. I hate talking about this with anyone but it helps. 

We’re about to move back to our hometown and I’m trying to find another job that’s not as long hours as mine is now, so it’s just a crazy time. 

I guess I’m just trying to get this off my chest and look for any advice or encouragement.

I'm writing what I get done each day on the dry erase board that I pass many time each day. Even if it's something small like taking a shower (which I don't always get to as it's not a high priority point of my day) or feeding the dogs. It might even make me more aware of taking care of myself more too (let's face it, we tend to make ourselves a low priority more often than not when they need a lot of care). 

&#x200B;

My hopes are that it will make me register what I do (and what is not just caretaking) and that I'm accomplishing (and not failing) on a regular day. Some days won't be that much other than what I do for Mom, but I'm trying not to let my own life (my own self-care, husband, pets, house, friends, hobbies) completely crash as she gets priority 95% of the time - everybody has been amazing and understanding, but our lives are completely different than they were before all of this and lots of things are just having to slide. 

&#x200B;

Basically, the only times I can leave the house any more is when we leave for one of her appointments, so I'm finding myself falling down a rabbit hole of a void which I'm trying to dodge like the plague. I can't control that much of my own life right now as she needs a ton of care and can't be alone at all anymore, so I'm trying to make the best of what I CAN control in my life. 

&#x200B;

On a better note, I'm getting a lot of small projects done around the house that don't take a lot of time all at once (she rings for assistance often as she can't do much for herself anymore). I'm also incredibly thankful for my husband as he works nights so he can take the night shift when he gets home so I can get some sleep, and I pick back up in the AM when he needs to go to bed. Unfortunately, we're both passing shifts (with him working full time as well) so we don't get as much sleep as we probably really need and are both running on fumes most of the time these days - this is also not helping my headspace, so I'm trying to get cat naps when I can as well (the caretaking is also a lot physically). Take what you can get, right? We're also trying to make a point to take time together on the weekends to watch a movie or show (and we take turns when she rings for assistance during that time) so we have some us time. Thankfully we are in the age of Netflix and streaming so we can pause whenever we need to hop back into caretaker mode.

I feel as if I suffering in silence then remind myself; mine is nothing compared to hers. Guilt for feeling this way manifests followed by anger for being selfish. Crying alone happens next, then fighting with myself to stop. Telling myself this not my time to break down. I then find the strength to become engaged and actively love and support my wife.

I know it is hard for everyone of any age but I was 23 (now 26) when my mom was diagnosed. It has been a journey full of a lot of ups and downs and down downs. Dealing with my mom's diagnoses has been extremely difficult for me and I have had to overcome a lot because of it. Since the diagnosis, I have felt completely apart from my peer who are not dealing with something like this. 

I have searched and searched for support groups aimed for young adults with parents who have cancer, I have not been successful. There's a a lot of support out there but none that is targeted at my age group. It's a challenge because we are not in high school where a lot of support groups are but yet we are not really old enough where aging and ill parents is a commonality among our peers. It a tough time, trying to grow into a real adult at this age and I am curious about the experiences of others.

I was turned to this sub from a kind redditor who spoke very highly of your support, and reading through the posts it seems like a wonderful and safe place to unburden oneself of all the pain and confusion that is borne from the situations we find ourselves in. I thank you in advance for your time in reading through our story.

Last year, my fiancee was diagnosed with stage 3 triple-negative breast cancer at the age of 28. We went through the whole treatment plan (chemotherapy, single side mastectomy, and radiation), and our scan last October showed no signs of the disease and were told she was cured. Of course we were absolutely ecstatic, feeling secure enough to make plans for our future without fear. But our time of peace only lasted a mere 4 months. She had a seizure in late January of this year, and this led us to finding out that the cancer had metastasized to her brain, adrenal gland, and both lungs. We were terrified, but at least it's treatable and we would have some time together still, albeit absurdly short (the doctor estimated about 5 years).

So we started chemotherapy (ixabepilone) and were hoping that everything was going well. But in late February she started complaining of severe discomfort in her back (consistently rating her pain level at a 7 or 8) so we made a visit to the emergency room, which ended up with us being admitted for 5 days: the chemotherapy wasn't working. In that time we learned that her cancer had spread to her kidneys and adrenal gland, liver, and pancreas. She also had another seizure which led us to finding six small tumors in her brain.

We recently finished going through whole brain radiation treatment and have started another type of chemo (Eribulin) this last Friday (and immunotherapy once she's completely off steroids).

She's my best friend and soul mate. We've been together for 3 and a half years and engaged for 3. Before being sent home by the palliative care team (which did get her pain under control with long acting morphine) we decided to get married, officiated by the hospital chaplain.

I'm thankful that we still have treatment options, but I am so so so worried that this next chemo won't work. The oncologist had told us that due to the aggressiveness of her cancer we can expect a year if this new treatment works: if it doesn't, we horrifically expect to have only another 6 months together.

I'm losing her so fast. How the fuck am I supposed to say goodbye to my best friend? She is a glass half full type, and has hope that this treatment will work and that an immunotherapy we're scheduled for (PD-1 inhibitor) will yield good results. But either way, a year will not be enough. No amount of time will ever be enough.

And it's so hard to enjoy the time we do have together with this spectre looming above us. We are realistic and open with each other, so our days are filled with as much laughter and joy as we can fit between the intermittent bouts of sobbing in each other's arms, lamenting the notion that she very well may not make it to her thirties, and that I will undoubtedly be a very young widower.

I am so not ready to say goodbye to the love of my life, and I know I never will be. She is so goddamn young, all the plans we had for our lives have been crushed within just a few months.

This is the most horrific and absurd way I can imagine to learn how unfair life really is. I'm not just terrified of losing her one day: I'm terrorized with the thought that I will have to watch my beautiful wife endure more and more pain and suffering as the months tick by.

I don't know how to do this.",2017-04-02 16:40:10

I usually return - snacks in hand - before he even leaves the waiting room. Well... the woman in front of me at Starbucks today bought the last blueberry muffin. The cashier checked the back. Checked the front. Muffinless. 

""My Dad's in treatment for cancer and this muffin is the one thing he looks forward to about coming up here"" I stammer over the giant lump in my throat. Tears begin to roll down my face. I'm turning beet red. I'm losing control. I'm overwhelmed. I'm angry. I'm sad. My emotions are bubbling over. The cashier apologizes profusely, obviously uncomfortable about my impending emotional outburst. I settle for a blueberry scone, give her my money, and immediately scramble to the corner of the room where I hide my face and wipe my tears... embarrassed. 

I feel a hand on my shoulder. I look up to find a middle aged black woman in business attire staring down at me. ""I just wanna give you a hug."" she says. I melt into her embrace as she soothes me saying ""I know honey, it's hard. I lost my father to cancer last year. It's okay to cry. It's okay to feel. You'll be okay. There are just some things that you can't control. Even muffins."" We part with a smile. I thank her for her kind words. She leaves with a friend, coffee in hand. 

I clean up my face. I grab our order from the barista. I go back down to the cancer center. Dad is gone, having been called for his treatment. Minutes later he's wheeled out to the waiting area by a member of the staff. I plaster a smile on my face, holding out the Starbucks goodies. We go the car. He eats his scone and never mentions the missing muffin. I don't mention my experience either. 

Huge amounts of gratitude to that business woman. I'll never know your name but I won't forget your kindness. Life is hard. We're harder. Rage on.",2016-12-07 13:43:08

My (35M) wife (33F) was first diagnosed with glioblastoma in January 2019, and after periods of relative stability and gradual decline, in the past month or so she’s experienced a cascade of pretty awful symptoms - near total loss of short term memory, increasing difficulty walking, increased difficulty finding the right words, confusion, vision changes, lots of nausea, and pain. We try our best to manage symptoms, and we’re still pursuing treatment options, but this is feeling very much like the end stage - I just don’t know how long the end stage lasts. Hospice is not yet involved. 

Has anyone here gone through this with a loved one? Does it just get more and more terrible, until it finally ends? I’ve read so many stories of people “passing peacefully,” but this is not peaceful.

He has severe inattentive type ADHD and anxiety. He is doing really well with school so far. 

My ex mother-in-law called me today and said she was just diagnosed with small cell lung cancer. She lives alone and needs someone to stay with her 24/7 while she goes through chemo and radiation, which could take 2 months. She wants my son to stay with her and take her temp multiple times a day, microwave meals, take out the trash, and just be there in case she falls.

My first reaction was that I didn’t think it was right or fair to ask that of a child. I understand and sympathize that she’s scared, but I don’t think she realizes what she’s asking of my son. She’s making it sound like a simple task, but I know it can’t be. 

My son has difficulty taking care of himself due to his ADHD. I have to remind him to brush his teeth, bathe, eat lunch and drink enough fluids on school days because his medication affects his appetite. His elearning consists of live Google Meet classes where he’s shut in his bedroom from 8am - 1pm everyday. He won’t be able to concentrate if he has to worry about her. He may be so engrossed in what he’s doing that he won’t hear her if something happens.

She said she spoke to my ex about it and he believes my son is fully capable of handling it and that it’s really up to my son if he wants to do it or not. I was like ummm no but okay. 

I asked my husband what he thought and he wasn’t sure. He said he needed to learn about the real world at some point and about being responsible. Obviously nobody around me has dealt with a cancer patient before.

I did some reading and it seems like a stressful, full-time job. Not to mention the risk of exposure to the treatment drugs by the caregiver if they have to clean up bodily fluids within the first 2 days. A teenage boy with ADHD isn’t exactly careful. 

Is everyone around me being completely naive or am I being overprotective? I think he should be concentrating on school and being a kid. I think she’s underestimating just how sick she’s going to be. He’s going to have a hard enough time knowing his grandma has cancer. He’s never dealt with death before.",2020-08-30 16:33:59

We have to drive 2.5 miles every other day in order to do the radiation session, and I know that this will be tough.

While his doctors, therapists, etc., are helping me, they are talking about Quality rather than Quantity at this point, which I know is what we are looking at, truthfully.  I don't tell him, because he is not ready to hear this, he will talk a little, but then he will clam up and I just let it lie.

Good things are he has gained a couple of pounds, which is good, but I am afraid that when he is under radiation it will get bad again.

In early July, my mother was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer in a pretty advanced stage (effected lymph nodes in distant regions like neck and lower stomach region). From never having any previous symptoms or serious health issues outside of a blood clot, she’s now being told that her anticipated life expectancy is around the 10 month mark. Our 2nd opinion oncologist that we visited today has said that her type of cancer has a best-case scenario survival rate of 2.5 to 3 years. 

My question to you, the experienced, is how do you organise your life around it? I’m 22, the middle child & we have a very close mother-daughter bond. I’ve taken every required day off work to get her to all of her appointments and to be with her throughout all medical developments. But, with the most consistent message being that she may die soon, I’m worried that a few days off here and there will not be enough.

I work full time in an admin job that is definitely not my end goal; I got it fresh out of uni so that I could be paid whilst looking for degree-relative work. My boss has been super understanding & flexible with me, but now I’m genuinely contemplating leaving.

For this, I defer to you guys. I’m very new to the process of living with cancer so close in my family, and it’s been such an emotionally blinding roller coaster. I don’t know what to do or where to go from here, and I’m hoping you guys have some experience in dealing with your workplace demands while having someone you love battle this dreadful disease.",2020-08-25 20:48:10

He was in chemo again until COVID hit and now he doesn’t leave the house at all (not that I blame him). The thing I’m trying to figure out is that he’s been lying down on the stairs or in the hall. Usually face down, so it’s not like he’s just chilling. No reaction seems to be reasonable. If I react with a lot of concern (omg are you okay!?), he acts like I’m being ridiculous. If I ask him how he is calmly, he says he doesn’t feel well and won’t elaborate or won’t answer. He seems to want me to just step over him and work around him. This is usually when I’m getting the kids ready and he’s very much in the way of things. He is super sensitive about being noticed when he’s doing it but acting like he isn’t there seems like an insensitive thing to do. The kids are too little to seem weirded out or worried about it but literally walking over your sick loved one seems like a bad example to set for them. I tell him it freaks me out because I’ve found him lying down in the hall when he’d have medical emergencies and I’d have to pick him up and bring him to the ER. His reaction to this (and most things where I “make things about myself”) is to be pretty irritated or act like I’m being dramatic so I’m looking for any clues.

We were told his long term survival cure rate is only 40%. Ever since March I’ve been feeling really apprehensive and dealing with anxiety and bouts of depression. What if I lose him? What am I going to do if I did?

Today he told me he hasn’t given up yet but he feels like he will die anyway, that it is very likely because of the numbers and his complex karyotype. I feel so distress because “feeling” that you’re going to die means so much more than just “thinking” about it. I think about the possibility everyday too and it pains me every time. He added that he’s ok dying, he’s come to terms with it. He’s accepted it even before it comes; even before the fight ends when it isn’t even over, when he’s still got a chance and the doctors aren’t giving up.

I am writing this on here because he has gone downhill in the last few weeks , meaning the final stages are approaching faster than expected.

This may sound strange but I haven’t showed much emotion, I feel like this is because I am constantly thinking of things I could help him with next. The way I have not showed emotions have really concerned me and I feel once he does pass, I will go off the rails.

141,5yo Nephew - Brain Cancer,7,ezmcrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/ezmcrg/5yo_nephew_brain_cancer/,5,1580989979.0,"My nephew (my sister’s child) was diagnosed with brain cancer three years ago in April, when he was 2.5. It’s been a really long and nightmareish road which, I’m sure anyone in this group would understand. He has been on multiple types of treatment, including a clinical trial. Currently, his tumor is “stable” (and the tumor isn’t just one mass - it’s like spaghetti, all through his brain and spine) but he has seizures multiple times a day and is impacted by them (or by the tumor or by the drugs, it’s unclear) cognitively and has severe ataxia which makes it really difficult for him to walk and impacts his fine motor control. Also, he’s an amazing kid with a wonderful sense of humor and is so, so sweet. Also the cutest kid ever. I love him so much. 

One of the things that has been difficult about this experience is processing my role in all of this. I’m the aunt, not the parent. I moved closer after he was diagnosed to be able to help. I’ve babysat every time they’ve asked and routinely offer. When he’s in the hospital, I’m usually there to take at least a quarter of the duties/shifts etc along with his parents. I would never say that my experience is the same as theirs - it isn’t. They live this nightmare every minute of every day. They are impacted financially and I am not. But I’m still a person and this has been the backdrop of my life for three years and it’s been horrible. But there’s no support for me. I’ve looked for support groups but there’s legitimately nothing that applies to me and is relevant enough to be helpful. I’m in therapy, which is wonderful, but my therapist doesn’t specialize in anticipatory grief or kids with terminal illness.  She hasn’t been through this. 

My nephew is the only child in our family. I’m 39 and single. My mom died five months before my nephew was diagnosed  

This has all been horrible for a long time, but I’m writing this because I’m struggling so much with my relationship with my sister as my nephew’s health declines. I’ve always experienced my sister as acting in ways that are hurtful to me.  She doesn’t have good skills to process things - she generally lashes out, especially at me. She says means things to me about my appearance, my relationship status, etc and if I protest, she acts very innocent and sort of turns things around on me, again making me the one with the problem. There have been years at a time where I wasn’t in touch with her at all for these reasons. When my nephew got sick, I decided to do what I had to do to maintain a relationship with him and to be a good aunt. At times my sister and I seemed to be a little closer, but as his health has declined (he was just released from the ICU after having almost catastrophic seizures) she’s seeming to want to distance herself and him from me - not taking me up on offers to come and visit or help at the hospital this week. Given that in the past I’ve been right in the thick of it with them in the hospital, that’s a radical change. 

I just got back from visiting them at home and it was heartbreaking- he’s not himself and she obviously (body language, tone of voice, etc) didn’t want me there. She’s grieving and has no support - refuses therapy, support groups, etc. Obviously she’s going to be at her worst which will mean she has no capacity to treat me with respect. But what do I do with my grief then? What happens if he dies and I haven’t seen him often because I don’t feel welcome and maybe I’ve faded from his memory? How am I going to live with this for the rest of my life?  

Thanks for listening.",2020-02-06 11:52:59

I made her tell me the exact pain level for each hour.  Last night my mother was on the floor for an hour rubbing her legs and I thought this has to stop.  If she refuses to request more pain meds then she can suffer without my elderly mom layinngon the floor rubbing her legs.  Then when the new nurse came she was finally able to get the point across to her that purposely avoiding answering questions about her pain levels was not productive.  The nurse made it clear there really is no limit to receiving the pain meds she needs at this point.  This is in home hospice.  Most people at her stage are drooling on themselves.  She even pointed out that she barely seemed on any medication at all.  Apparently my sister may have been concerned with becoming addicted.  I felt like saying, you're dying in three months, who gives a fuck.  You could be shooting heroin for all it matters!  Seriously!  She's been a shut in her whole life and has Dependant Personality Disorder (undiagnosed).  She has never stood up for herself or spoken up.

At a routine scan a mark was found on his liver, which turned out to be cancerous. For the next two years we fought hard to keep him around, never losing hope. Since OM is a rare cancer we had to search for treatment options and travel around the country to search out information. He endured failed surgery, medical trials, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The care he received from NHS staff was almost always excellent, but we noticed that when he was taking part in a trial (Which was privately paid for by the drug companies) he received scan and test results much more quickly. It occurred to me that most people who have cancer wait weeks, or occasionally more than a month, for results from tests or scans which tell them whether and how their disease is progressing.  I reached out to many other cancer sufferers and my fears were confirmed. This wait was always so hard for us and although my Dad was the most positive person I've ever met, it even got to him sometimes, especially in the last weeks of his life when we knew time was running out and decisions were more urgent. Unfortunately, my Dad died in June 2018 never having had his last go at chemotherapy because the results from his tests came too late. It may have made a difference, it may not, but it would have been nice to have been able to try. In my Dad's memory and with the support of cancer charity OcuMel I have created a petition urging the government to consider the time it takes for cancer patients to receive scan or test results. It seems like the only thing on the agenda at the moment is Brexit, but people are still living and suffering through 'normal' life. There are things which need addressing and this is one of them. If you are frustrated, or worried about the time it takes cancer patients to get results, please consider signing my petition. Thank you.

When she came back they said it spreak but the medicine was helping and stopping it from spreading. After a week or 2 they said that the medicine didn't do anything and that it was helping. Her lungs started to fill with fluids and they told us that they'd give her chemo pills and that it would probably stop the fluid. It didn't. They than said that they could give her a drain so she didn't have to go to the hospital every 2 weeks and stay there for a week every time. And than they said that they wouldn't do that and that they didn't have a solution. Her chemo pills are their last attempt, because she already did every thing else
Chemo, surgery, lazer, pills, chemo pills and all that shit. 

She kind of gave up on herself. She doesn't want to leave the house and the only time.she leaves the house is to go to the hospital. I want to get her a wheelchair cause she no longer has the strength to walk a lot and I want her to leave the house with me so she can enjoy life and not get depressed. She refuses the weelchair cause she's to pride. She says that she would wait for my brother or my father to take her places with their car. They won't. I tried everything to convince them but they don't care enough and don't see the need for her to leave the house.  I don't have my license yet, so I can't take her and she isn't able to walk enough without it hurting and without her being exhausted. 

I know that the doctors see her as a lost case, cause they said that the chemo pills were there last attempt and that
 They can't do anything else. I know that my mother gave up for the most part and is just waiting for it to happen and that kills me.

It seems like everyone kind of gave up. Should I give up? Am I an ass for concidering it. Every time I go to school, internship, work or to get her anything I feel like I can't breathe till I come back and see that she's still alive. Every time my phone rings or buzzes I feel like that's it. Every time I go to sleep I wonder if she's going to wake up. I had a couple of shocks when she randomly fell asleep during our conversation and I thought that that was the end. I try to not shake her up, and I don't want her to worry when that happens so I just feeze and listen to see if she moves or breathes. I feel like I'm stressed out 24/7. 

I feel bad when I leave her for school/work/groceries or doctor appointments, because I'm the only one who really takes care of her. I don't know if anyone would notice it of she didn't breathe any more. They'd think she's sleeping, but what if she isn't sleeping? I think that I'm going crazy. Today at work I kept hearing a phone buzzing and ringing and I kept rushing to my phone, but  no one was calling. I've gotten several panick attacks thinking that it was over and my mother already said that if her heart were to stop, she didn't want to be saved. I can't really sleep anymore. Not when I'm not by her side which I can only be at the hospital otherwise by dad's with her. 

I think the worst part is thar I can't hold her. I can't hug her without causing her more pain. I can't touch her. And I can't talk to her. It's like the stronger her cancer is the more it takes over her. It changes her. Sometimes I feel that the woman she is not my mother, but she still is. 

I tried to open up to her and to my friends about it. My friend said that I make it to much about me. That I use her cancer to make people feel bad about me. And my mother doesn't believe that we (my father, brothers and I really suffer because we're not the ones having cancer). She feels like we should continue to live our lifes like she doesn't have it. But she has cancer. And it doesn't matter what I'm doing I can never let that go. 

I no longer know. Should I give up? I feel like someone locked me in a room and told me that there's a bomb that's going to go off, but the person didn't tell me when. On the background I constantly heat it ticking and with every minute that passes I feel both happy that it didn't happen and nervous, scared, anxious and just terrified that it's going to happen soon. 
And I'm trying to get out! I want to get out, but it doesn't matter how hard I try ir how hard I cry the door won't open and I keep hearing it ticking. When I'm happy for something, the sound brings me back down. And every time someone gives up, a doctor tells me that they can't do anything the sound get's louder and I feel the walls just closing in on me. It's like metal walls apear and create a even smaller room that I get stuck in. 
That's the feeling. I feel stuck. And in my head I'm trying to convince myself that the person lied and that there is no bomb, but I hear it ticking. Every breathe could be her last. And she's the reason I'm here. And I know that I don't want to be here if she isn't here. 

I desperately want no need to hug her, to know that it's going to be okay. And I can't.  So I either keep slaming myself against the walls trying to break free or I need to accept what's coming. Give up. 

And I don't want to give up, but now it feels like me fighting and living in fear is going to reach a point where it's even worse than the pain of it ending. 
But I constantly remind her to keep fighting and to not give up. How could I tell her that if I already gave up. 

I want to ger my driver's license so I can take her wherever she wants to go. So I can help her escape reality. I also want to just quit every thing and stay by her side to not miss a second. I want to make her proud and get my degree and get a good job. I want to buy her a house that she has always dreamed off. I want her to enjoy life. To be with the people she loves. I want to show her the world and take her to everywhere. I want to teach her how to swim and take her to the beach. I want her to not be in pain. I want her to be at my wedding one day, cause she told me that that was her dream. I want her to hold my grandchildren one day and show her that I raised them well, because she raised me well. I want her to be with her entire family: with all her sisters and brothers and her mother. I want all the people that she loves to be there for her and show her all the love in the world, because that is what she deserves. 

I want her to not cry about my brother's lack of interest in her well being. I want her to not cry when he goes weeks without even saying a word to her, even though he lives with her. I want my dad to stop being ignorant about her being sick. I want him to take it seriously so he stops looking at me like I'm insane for worrying and wanting her to live. I want him to realize that his wife is no longer able to take care of him cause she's no longer able to take care of herself. 

When the sun goes down, reality sets in. I can't give her everything that I want to give her. I can't give her what she deserves. My father and brothers will only realize what she meant to them when she's gone. Right now they look at me to do all she did for them: cook, clean and just take care of them. But I'm tired of taking care of everybody's needs. 

I'm just searching for a small appartment now, cause she's all I got in this world and I can't stand the idea of being near them when she's not here. I hope that I could take her there so she's out of this house, filled with careless and selfish individuals, empty conversations and fake sincerity. 

I gave up on them. I need to not give up on her.",2019-07-07 06:52:06

He’s 65 and fighting late stage lung cancer. Even before his diagnosis and chemo he was a picky eater. Now after 6 months of chemo, he refuses to eat ‘real’ food, and mostly subsists on ensure/instant breakfast type things. He might a bowl of cereal every now and then, but recently headaches have also become a new symptom and also messes up his appetite. Supposedly he’ll eat tuna sushi every now and then, but he generally does not eat solid food. He keeps losing weight and I’m very worried. I don’t know what to do to entice him to eat, any suggestions or foods that might help would be great.

TLDR: Dad won’t eat because he has no appetite from chemo. Any suggestions/experiences to help him? Any foods to try?

Thanks.",2019-05-12 10:50:46
150,This is our story,8,bl6klt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/bl6klt/this_is_our_story/,6,1557139787.0,"Jan. 2018 David ( now husband) could not swallow very well he went to his military doctor the did the standard and file out the paper work to get a scope done. 

2 months later he goes back to the military doctor (different one) starting to have chess pain and his diet is now liquid and wanted to know about the scope. Did testing for his heart found out that they didn't file the scope paperwork correctly.  

Month later goes back to the new military doctor that is now stationed there. Looks at everything looks at David, puts a rush on a scope. August was the quickest date.

End of August we go out of town to get the scope done. Find tumors, they take a biopsy not even a week later we get a call. We go back to the doctor that helped him gave us the bad news. Gives us so much information, and more ensures so he can keep up with his weight.

We get a call that day to go out of town to another hospital to do exploratory surgery. We find out it's stage 4. Few days later David gets a feeding tube. 2 weeks go by under observation, what was supposed to be a 3 day treatment turned out to be longer. 

The make arrangements for him to go at the cross cancer center with all the supplies. After all the seminars and informations he gets a port, and informations for a clinical trial.

This point we were planning a wedding before all this happened.  Between paper work , doctors appointments and work. We know that he have gasteric esophageal cancer stage 4. I tell my work I need to be on stress leave because I need to take care of David. Not to mention September and October was a blur. We do a quick small cerimony to get married.  

With all the medications chemotherapy and immunotherapy booster at first it was helping him. But few month in his liver tumor grew . They took him off the clinical trail and set him up with something geared toward his type of cancer. 

This therapy had a lot less side effects, and we are now waiting for my husband to get his ct scan at the end of the month. But right now he has been getting major back pains and the hospital here is trying their best to help him. I had to call the ambulance this morning because he could not sit up without breathing. 


Ps sorry this is so long..

Update may 6, we get a rush ct scan an hour away from this hospital to another.  We find out what is causing his back pain. His tumor grew and it's pressing on the c6 vertebra causing friction and pressure.  So now tomorrow we are going to the cross cancer that is an hour for radiation.",2019-05-06 10:49:47

152,So Tired,9,b4yfv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/b4yfv5/so_tired/,1,1553474818.0,"I (F47) almost told my father (66) to f\* off and get out of my house today.  I need a break and my vacation with my sister on Friday to Cuba cannot come fast enough.  


My father was diagnosed with angiosarcoma Jan 2017 in his two cheeks and brow areas.  He is one of the rare of the rare with this cancer (which is rare in itself) as the majority of those who get it are other cancer survivors (radiation induced)...his just happened after a large garbage can hit him in the face and left a bruise.  


My father lives with me and for the most part we get along, I learned to ignore his constant negativity (i.e you can say ""look dad there's a blue jay on the veranda"" and his comment would be ""great, he'll probably shit every where"") over the years but it is getting so bad that I hate being around him and talking to him as it just brings me down.  


I am losing my empathy because of his attitude and constant negativity - I feel horrible in saying this but I with the cancer would just hurry up and end it because I am not sure how much longer I can live with him and it is only getting worse.  


He did chemo in 2017 - did really well with it but in June had some kind of heart or stroke issue and after one more month of chemo removed it from it.  They let his body heal until Dec 2017 when his face started up again and they put him on doxil (an infusion that lasts 3 weeks and then you go back and get another) but in a week he landed in the hospital with no white blood count for a week.  No more chemo for him.    


Radiation was started March 2018 until May 2018 - he almost made it through all planned rounds (22 of 25) of his cheeks but cut short the radiation around his eyes (9 of 15) as he couldn't take the eye pain anymore (his eyelids looked like crispy bacon).  It took him a good 6 months to heal from that.  

  
He has opted for no more treatment, and he goes to a palliative care doctor every 3-4 weeks and a nurse visits every other week.  His face is getting very angry and with it his moods.  He is on many pills (steroids, antibiotics, probiotics, metformin (started today), etc, etc and blew up at me just now when I brought the new med home about how many pills he is taking and what does he call this one and he has to take it two times a day and then proceeds to read off the side affects, getting angrier and angrier.  He goes on about the two times a day WITH food and I couldn't bite my tongue and said, well...you do eat twice a day so I'm not seeing a problem.  I had to walk away because I was about to blow up at him.  Not just because of that, but 5min before I had walked into the house after grocery shopping and no sooner than I closed the door he was complaining about my robot vacuum (""tired of hearing it so I just picked it up and put it back to its home and it better not decide to continue!"") and then I got ""my face found a new place to leak"" and he shows me the bridge of his nose and ""how the hell am I suppose to sleep now?"" and he continued on that ramp...then the metformin...  
It has been non-stop for a good two weeks now.  Thursday as I left for work in the morning just as I closed the door he yelled out ""I'm going to talk to the doctor tomorrow about assisted suicide"" and then that was on my brain all day.  And of course he didn't (I went to his appointment with him) and he was jovial and nice (the doctor calls him an excuse for an excuse right to his face as my father has excuses for everything of why he cannot do what the doctor asks him to do).  


I really wish my Grandma was alive (his mom) as he's always been like this and she always helped me with his moods.  But now it just me (all siblings live over an hour away) and it is getting worse every.single.day.  He doesn't want treatment, so it is just going to get worse.  His decision!  I have all these horrible thoughts in my head, I just want it over, please don't let this go on and on.  I want my life back.  


Thank you for letting me rant.

And he is coming up on 3yrs of cancer treatments. I have always felt strongly that he would be able to pull through, and things seemed almost manageable for a while, but he recently confessed that he has lost all hope. Not only that, but he hasn't felt any hope since before Christmas. I'm devastated by this. I know how critical someone's mindset can be to their recovery, and even though there has been no change in prognosis (which is not good but ever changing) suddenly I feel like I've already lost him, and like my entire world just shattered. I flat out don't want to live in a world he's not in, and I am having a really, really hard time trying handle this news. Since he told me, tears just keep rolling down my cheeks; not really crying, but more like all my fear and grief and desparation are all just overflowing out of my eyes.

I'm trying to be careful, as I don't want him feeling burdened by how I'm feeling about this right now, but I suddenly feel like there is no reason to carry on. 

This isn't a suicide message. I don't want to live, but I will, because I have obligations and leaving here with him isn't an option, I just don't know how I could ever go on without him. 

Truly, he is such a good man, and is an actual gift to everyone who knows him, I don't know how any of us could go on without him.

I was beyond frustrated with with the caregiving aspect. I had said that my mother was bat shit crazy. Irrational at times. Paranoid at times as well. Just how exhausting it was. Welll today while getting mama up and ready for the day she seemed a bit of her old self. She even tried to explain her crazy wacked out frame of mind. For all intents and purposes i really think i was speaking to my mother. Not the bat shit crazy loon who has hijacked my mother. She was describing vividly the things she thought she saw. She knew they weren't real but her mind wouldn't let her see it any other way. It's like she woke up if thats possible? If i wasn't fucked up i sure am now....she had to bring up things i never knew. She mentioned my grandmother her mother had my aunt when she was 17 and in the 1940's that was scandalous. My nana had come from a very wealthy well to do family. The shame that her pregnancy brought her family. My mother and her sister are 4 years apart. My grandmother my mother's mother was extremely abusive to my mother. Also very manipulate. She had sent my aunt to go live with her mother my mother's grandmother my nanas mother. My aunt was raised by my mother's grandmother. My mother was sent to live with her as well off and on. But my mother was young she wanted her mother. She cried every day for her. My mother's grandmother sent my mother back to live with my nana my mother's mother. ( hope who is reading can follow ) my nana  was brutal physically and emotionally twords my mother. The stories my mother told us while growing up were aweful. No child should have endured what my mother did. I thought my mother told me all the stories.....um apparently not cause today in her lucidity she told me that her father had an affair with her sister and she had a baby.  ( as a teen  ) That when my aunt was older she came back to live with them. She slept with my mothers father. Apparently he wasn't her father. What the fuck did i just hear. Apparently when they were younger he had molested my aunt but my nana didn't belive her and sent her away. She kicked my mothers father out. My nana was 21 with two kids. It was also revealed by my mother that her and my aunt have diffrent fathers. What the fuck. I so don't want to know any of this. My nana has photo albums of my mothet with her father and all his face are cut out of all the pictures. I had seen those photo albums in my life time but i never asked. I just thought maybe she was angry and cut him out figuratively. But i wouldn't have ever guessed. Plus she layed on that she has a  half brother and wants mr to find him before she dies. It's not like i even know where to start. I don't wanna bring up old wounds by asking my aunt what she knows. And not to mention it makes sence why my nana beat on my mother. My mother probably reminded her of the man who did such unspeakable things to her child. It makes sence why my aunt is so quiet and has fought depression all her life. It breaks my heart. My mind is realing from all of this. I can't call nana and say hey nana is this true. She's almost 100. She's very with it. No bat shit crazy. Actually for her age my nana is very much with it. When my mom was in her crazy delusional states she would call nana and fight with her cause she said she wants answers before she leaves this world she wants to know the truth about their lives .i asked her "" why now "" she said she wants to know if all the abuse she suffered as a kid up untill 18 years old was it real. She wants her mother to confess. This is all so fucking sureal. There's so much more to these dynamicsm my mother always was telling us kids. "" what happens in our home stays in our home, no telling anyone "" my mother never spoke badly of her mother. In fact she loves her mother to death. I feel she felt rejected at times and now she's nearing the end of her life she is just gonna dump all this on me. What am i supposed to do with this information? I don't know. But I'll tell you all this i wish i never knew. Is my mother really telling secrets or is she making things up? It's still disturbing to hear. My brain and heart can't take much more of this. I'm gonna go crazy. I've never even heard about this thru the family. How could this be a secret for so long. If this is true i need to keep to myself...i don't want to know any more family secrets. This is crazy. Just had to purge this. But have others experienced this. While caring for a loved one whos close to death. Have you gotten a family secret that you never have heard before?  I listened to her. I tried to change the subject but she wasnt haveing it. She just had to tell me. I hope there is no more family secrets tomorrow. Please let me just have an easy time tomorrow.

He is in his 70's and has participated in several experimental trials which have made him incredibly sick and uncomfortable, though this last round of chemo did seem to provide some relief from pain in his bones (it still made him throw up or have diarrhea nearly daily). He has refused ""alternative medicine"" like CBD to treat pain and has preferred to remain off of opioids because of the way they affect him (making him feel loopy). He will be starting another experimental drug in a few weeks, and I feel nervous for what comes.

My mother has always been pretty masterful in terms of obfuscating the situation, but recently came home after leaving my son with her for 2 hours to finish up Christmas shopping and get some grocery items for my parents. I feel awful. I had no idea things had gotten so bad, and would have never left my son with her if I'd known. My step-father had urinated all over the floor upstairs, and my mom was frantically cleaning up after him. She admitted that it was a regular occurance, and that when he takes opioids he seems especially out of it, and pays less mind to those processes. She said he refuses to wear depends leaving her to clean up after him several times a day. She cooks for him, cleans up after him, helps him walk up and down the stairs, to sit in his chair, and yet he seems so unwilling to help her out. He also has refused to wear hearing aids, so watches the TV   with the volume up so loud that its impossible to be in the same room as he is in.

&#x200B;

My father also died of cancer, and I feel all of those feelings coming flooding back. He refused to sign paperwork and get his affairs in order because he didn't want to die. It made it so difficult for my Mom to get through that process, because as he was dying there were lawyers in the room having him sign those papers. He could barely lift his hand. I feel so bad for my Mom having to relive those experiences, and I feel so out of control. I feel like yelling at him to wear depends for the person he loves most in life. I feel like everything is just so hard.

Edit 2: I know some of these things like the TV volume seem petty. It's just one of those things that is difficult I think to come to terms with. When someone you felt very close to changes. I think I'm reacting to the difficulty in adjusting to that, and also just wishing that I could have those moments to talk with him. I feel like if he would wear hearing aids he would be able to spend better time with us, instead of complaining that people don't talk with him or spend time with him, but he is always watching television so loud that it's not possible to share time with him. I suppose the point is that I need to adjust and sit in the room with the TV up. This stuff is so hard.",2018-12-24 11:37:25

160,PSA: Keep your pain meds locked up!,7,9yhzh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/9yhzh9/psa_keep_your_pain_meds_locked_up/,0,1542671864.0,"Just a reminder to caregivers out there, having pain medications in the household can present personal security risks and hazards to our pets and loved ones.

I had a long conversation with my Dad’s hospice nurse towards the end. Among many other difficult subjects, we discussed the safe handling/storage/disposal of his pain meds. Thankfully we never had any issues with meds along the way, but I can see how there might have been problems under different circumstances.

Security:

Keep all of the narcotics locked in a safe or cash box when they’re not in use. Don’t talk about what meds the patient is using with anyone outside of the care team. Whenever possible, avoid using the terms “palliative care” and “hospice” when discussing the patient’s condition. You might trust the person you’re telling, but the next person he/she tells might not be so trustworthy.

Sadly, most abuse cases involve “diversion” which is to say that caregivers, family and friends are the ones most likely to divert (steal) a cancer patient’s medication for personal use or to sell. Be wary of estranged family and friends who show a sudden interest in spending time alone with, or offer to look after the patient so you can run errands etc. They may just want to help or reconnect, but keep it in the back of your mind that they might also be sniffing around for drugs. Less often, strangers or burglars will attempt to steal the meds or even commit an [armed home invasion](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/sicamous-home-invasion-1.4878969).

It’s scary to think about, but there are also industry insiders, such as palliative nurses, pharmacy workers, medical equipment delivery folks etc. -who might [attempt to steal medications](https://www.americannursetoday.com/painful-problem-drug-diversion-can/) or even tip-off potential thieves to the patient’s address. It isn’t a bad idea to take a closer look at home security. Keep doors locked and bolted, post signs for security cameras and break-in alarms (having an actual system installed would be even better), turn on flood lights at nighttime etc.

Handling and disposal:

Avoid getting liquid medications such as morphine on your skin. Wear gloves when replacing Fentanyl patches. Even used patches can lead to inadvertent absorption. Take great care with disposal. Used patches can absolutely kill a child or pet.

Depending on state or municipality, there are varying laws concerning safe disposal of meds. For example, many areas consider it illegal to throw used Fentanyl patches in the trash or sewer system. Aside from the environmental risks, abusers will literally dig through your trash to find old patches and chew on them. It’s heartbreaking stuff, but just be aware.

You should never let a hospice/palliative nurse leave with un-destroyed meds. Some care systems have methods for disposal where the meds and used patches are placed in a gel pouch that effectively destroys the medications and/or renders them poisonous. These methods normally require signatures and receipts for accountability and transport. Alternatively (preferably) you can dispose of the medications in a government-owned drop box. Just make sure you discuss this with your care team ahead of time.

Those are the main points I can think of for now, but there are a ton of resources online. A quick google will turn up information and drop box locations. [for example](https://www.health.ny.gov/professionals/narcotic/medication_drop_boxes/)

Take care, God Bless",2018-11-19 23:57:44
161,Depression,8,9u5tsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/9u5tsr/depression/,2,1541385514.0,"Both my husband and I are dealing with depression problems right now. We both see therapists already, so I'm not looking for that kind of help.

I don't know how to help my husband when I myself am also depressed. In the past, we've both gone through phases, but not generally at the same time. My husband has begun obsessing over minor (non-cancer related) health issues, saying that he has no purpose in life, saying he should just give up, not wanting to leave the house, etc. Today he wouldn't get out of bed. He got up to take his chemo, and then went back to bed saying he needed to sleep more. We already got an extra hour with the time change, and he finally got up to take a shower at 1:30 because I expressed my frustration. 

It's hard because I'm mad at him for giving up when there's no reason for him to do so. His health is stable. He can't work, but he's not an invalid. He could volunteer or do some other activities outside of the house, but refuses to do so. He keeps saying he wishes he were just hospitalized so he didn't have to do anything. I would have more sympathy if there was a physical reason for all of this, but his health is stable.

Meanwhile, I still have to do everything. I don't get to give up. Now I'm having to work and go to school full time on top of picking up all the slack from him. We had no food in the house this week because he didn't go to the store. We've been getting by on leftovers, but now I'm going to have to go grocery shopping and cooking. The dishes need to be done, the floors need to be vacuumed, and a million other small things. We had agreed that he would take care of the house stuff since I was going back to school. I can't physically do all of these things. There are literally not enough hours in my day. 

How come he gets to give up, but I have to keep going? Anyone have any advice?",2018-11-05 02:38:34

Last Thursday, she passed away at 4.50am in the morning. We'd gotten a call to come to the hospice immediately but missed her by 10 minutes. Her hands were still warm when we got there. I hugged her and it still felt like she was with us. The music we had put on for her was still playing, even though she was no longer here to hear it. I've been replaying the events of that day in my mind over and over for the past few days. When they told us she'd left us, when she was cremated, when we immersed her ashes in the sea. It all happened in 2 days. 

I think she might've known her time was coming to an end. She was a huge coffee lover. On the day before she passed, she asked my dad to make her a cup of coffee. She had 2 teaspoons of it and didn't want the rest. Not once in the 2.5 weeks she was hospitalised did she make a request like that. 

I went to her office for the first time after her passing 2 days ago. It was painful but comforting to look through her things. It's all I have of her now. I learned so much about her in the time I was there. She never struck me as a fiercely sentimental person as she was always so private. I found so many letters she had written to people about me when I was young. I knew she loved me, but I never realised how much. 

I always knew she'd experienced a lot of hardship in her life. I never truly knew how much until that day. It made me angry at cancer, that it would target someone who had already gone through so much. I wish I could've held her close and shared her pain when she was still alive. I wish I could've talked to her about all I learned. I hope she knows how proud I am to call her my mother. I wish she could've had more time to be happy. But I'm comforted by the fact that she's finally at peace. ",2018-08-14 20:28:21

One of the biggest tumors is in the stomach. He has lost so much weight bc he doesn’t eat. He used to be super happy and loud and strong. Now he is weak, skinny and I think depressed(doesn’t leave his bed). I know the worst is yet to come, he hasn’t even started chemo yet. I tell him to try to get up more and move around and eat more now that he can because chemo is going to make him feel worse for a bit. He can talk and walk but chooses not to. I have made so many phone to the doctor, nurse practitioner, radiology department, pharmacy etc to make sure that he is being seen and treated ASAP and to make sure he gets his meds. I know idk how he feels and whats going on inside his head. I know he is probably going through the process of acceptance. I just wish he tried eating a bit more and getting up from his bed. 

He has a procedure this Tuesday and hopefully will be able to see the doctor on Friday to talk about starting chemo already. The doctor said that is the tumor shrinks with chemo, he will hopefully want to eat more. I really look forward to this bc it’s sad seeing my dad real skinny and weak.

This is my first post ever on Reddit and I thought this would be a good place to start bc this is a major event happening in my life. I apologize if i went on a rant, I feel I had to get a lot out of my system. I did hold back a lot.

167,I'm tired. And angry...and scared :(,7,6qtawt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/6qtawt/im_tired_and_angryand_scared/,6,1501582973.0,"When I was 15, my mom was diagnosed with stage III breast cancer.  She went through treatment, chemo/radiation/mastectomy, and two years later was 'cured'.  While that was happening my dad went on a few benders, got taken to rehab by fed up neighbors/friends, and generally used it as an excuse to peace out on responsibility.  

In the intervening years, they got the long overdue divorce.  My dad got remarried.  And my mom's cancer came back, 4 years ago.  She had a reaction to an antibiotic, suddenly had major ascites and, in an effort to figure out what was going on, a scan was done that showed mets in her bones.  Her liver doc didn't think it was in her liver and thought it was a drug reaction, her oncologist thought it was in her liver but diffuse.  Ascites went away as treatment began, but personally I think that was coincidence.  So did her liver doc.

She's been on hormone treatment for the last 4 years.  The last treatment being tamoxifen, which she had been on maybe 4 months.  She hadn't felt right on it since basically the start.  Last weekend, she developed ascites again.  Her oncologist did a CT scan and said she had cirrhosis and that the peritoneum was thickened.  She didn't see cancer, but she was sure it had spread.  We stopped the tamoxifen, scheduled chemo and an appt to drain the fluid from her abdomen.  

Did chemo and the drain on Thursday.  Fluid is back today.  

They're testing the fluid they removed from her abdomen for cancer cells, to type them.  I guess we'll find out Wednesday if they found any.  But a part of me wonders if this is the cancer.  She's had a genetic test which indicated she was a poor processor of tamoxifen.  Her onc completely dismissed that when we told her, saying there wasn't enough evidence to support that it would be an issue.  And my mom was on tamoxifen before, after her remission.  

But what caused the cirrhosis?  It wasn't there before tamoxifen.  

I'm wondering if the issue with the antibiotic 4 years ago damaged her liver enough to make it unable to handle tamoxifen like it could 15 years ago.  

I don't want to be delusional but I feel like this is a reasonable explanation for what's going on.  Tamoxifen has done this to other people, caused ascites.  Anecdotally, but I found two other instances on forums.  I don't want them to assume the treatment isn't working and move on.  I don't want her to go into liver failure.  But I'm terrified that it has spread, too.  

She didn't remarry, and it's just me and my brother.  He doesn't really comprehend the potential severity of the situation.  I lived at her house up until I bought my own in February.  I'm so relieved that I got out before this happened, because I'd never have left if this happened before I did.  And I feel awful for thinking that.  My brother still lives with her, so I figure it's only fair I take her to all her appointments, I stay with her through chemo, I field her questions, look up her symptoms and treatments (I have an MS from the uni affiliated with her cancer hospital and spent 2 years there doing cancer research, actually, so I understand why she's asking me to do it, but it's mentally taxing).

I'm rambling.  I'm sorry.  I'm just so angry this is all happening.  And I'm pissed at my father for running away like a coward, and making a new life while leaving me to deal with his addiction (I had to do 2 interventions for him after rehab - at 22 and again when I was 24 - before he finally got his shit together), then to deal with this.  And then getting annoyed that I didn't have time to text him back about a stupid barbecue he was planning last weekend.  

I feel like so much of my life has revolved around this disease.  I took care of her back when I was in high school, continued through college while she was getting her reconstruction, and then the fucking thing came back when I was 27.  And I'm taking care of her again.  I don't know if she's dying, like actually dying, and I feel like I can't trust her oncologist to consider any explanation that's not cancer.  I'm so tired of this shit and being the strong one.  I feel like I'm holding back on parts of my life because of her and knowing how much she depends on me.  And I kind of resent her for it too.  And a tiny part of me wonders if I'll be relieved when she dies.  Even though I'm pretty sure I'll just be miserable.  And I feel like a horrible person for even thinking it.  

I don't know what I'm looking for with this post.  I'm just tired.

The amazing doctors provided wonderful treatment and sent him straight to radiation. He does not have insurance so we applied for social security. The oncologist and the radiologist treated him anyway while we waited on the results of social security. Social security put him on medical hold until August. I feel sick to my stomach. This means we can't get anymore treatment unless the oncologists are willing to take him in for another 2 months no charge. That's highly unlikely (and I don't blame them they've done so much). I'm the only one who can work and have been killing myself with overtime just to pay for the meds all while taking care of him. He's unable to walk without crutches or bathe or feed himself. I just feel sick to my stomach that they could do something like this. On the phone with the agent he basically said if it's spread to other organs by August they can help. Honestly I think they're just waiting for him to die so they don't have to help. My heart is broken. The love of my life is sick and there's almost nothing anyone can do anymore. I'm trying to be strong for him, but I can't help feeling like I'm breaking. I just want him to get the treatment he needs. He's so stressed now I can feel it in my bones.

I must say I'm so greatful to all the doctors, nurses, and oncologists that have been helping him when he has nothing to pay them with. The love and support we had was amazing.

Cancer was one, thing, but hearing stage 3 was the worst day of my life. Since then, her cancer has now gone metastatic. She has tumors in her neck (encasing her carotid artery), her lungs, and spine. She is a single mother of two, my sister and I (30 and 27) are now taking turns caring for her even though we both live in different states.

Since the tumor on her neck, my mom effectively sounds like Minnie Mouse. I know it bothers her, and frankly it's often hard to understand her. She's always kept to herself not wanting her daughters to worry. But now I can tell in her face she has so much to say but too embarrassed to talk.

The radiation of her spine has been the worst yet. The neck was pretty bad. Had to make a run to the ER once from the pain. But with the spine she is constantly in pain and uncomfortable. Pain and anxiety meds only do so much. She's barely eating and down to 89lbs. We have physical therapists and nurses visiting, but taking care of her is hard. 

I don't know when to push her to do things and when to let her rest. I don't know if she actually thinks my food tastes bad or she is just being stubborn. It feels like she's given up sometimes and I don't know how to approach the situation. Sometimes I want to just scream and cry and run away. Not witnessing deterioration first hand would be so much easier. 

My mom took care of me, I got married and my husband takes care of me, and now my mom is sick and I have to take care of her and have no idea how. I don't know how to enjoy my time with her when she is so miserable. I don't know if my sister and I should start making funeral arrangements. It's such a rollercoaster.

I know lots of conversations about caregiving during covid are happening, so I’m sorry if this is redundant. 
This month we learned his colon cancer metastasized to his lungs, via zoom with the oncologist following his biopsy. My partner added his parents onto the zoom call. Before covid he and I would attend his appointments/treatments together in person. 

I love his family but they all live out of state and want to come visit without quarantining first, though they’re aware of the risk. They’re very smart people and just care about him, but the last time they did this for his first round of chemo, we were hosting family every other weekend (sometimes even coming over when he had expressly said he preferred to rest). They are lovely people, but headstrong and determined once they make a decision, but it drained us both. He said it was exhausting though when they were here he tried so hard to be present. They would bring food he couldn’t stomach/digest, and leave a huge mess I would spend hours cleaning. Once an elderly relative visited our apartment after he had just returned from the hospital following his colectomy and she used our one bathroom for long periods of time when he painfully could not wait for that. He said absolutely nothing while being the most uncomfortable I’ve ever seen him but I couldn’t say anything about it. 

He told me it is what it is, and he isn’t scared of getting covid despite numerous conversations about it; it’s like we’re on the same page of how risky it is, but he doesn’t want to make waves with his family. When they’re here, they want to drive him in a compact car (unmasked), eat in very close proximity unmasked, and have suggested he move back with them for treatment and have pressed for inquiring about surgery as a solution (oncologist has said it doesn’t work that way). He has not contested anything, but has been firm about not moving out. 
I feel like the nag, I feel overprotective and every time we try to have this conversation I just start to cry and the conversation stops. He has hardly cried and never loses his temper, while throughout this I have cried frequently, randomly, and I usually do so where he can’t see/hear me. 
I don’t want to see a repeat of last year, but already his family is planning to fly up next weekend, without any extra period of quarantine. 
I can’t consult my own family; they love him a lot and love his family, but then say they would like to all hang out together when they are in town! Which would be worse!! So I am not telling them when they’re coming up. 

Do you just embrace being overprotective? I want to respect his agency and relationship with his family, but how can I enforce that if they do what they want anyway? And I don’t understand how he can know how dangerous it is yet believe he would be fine (especially since it has now spread to his lungs). I feel like causing him stress by making waves with his family would also be detrimental to him while he’s already going through the stress of this diagnosis. His family has been very loving with me despite the stress their visits put us both through and I don’t want to hurt our relationship long term, though my mental health has hit a wall.

My partner 35m and I had been together just over a year and a half, everything was perfect, we were so happy and had plans for the future - children etc.

To say this diagnosis has ripped our world apart is an understatement. I've been doing well, I still work 20 hours a week and have been handling chemo relatively well. If you didn't know me you wouldn't know I was sick to look at. 

My issue is we have only been intimate once sonce I was diagnosed. Before that it was often, we were so in love. I still feel those feelings towards him but he seems to have lost them towards me. I do cry a lot and am terrified about what's going to happen to me in the future so am wondering if my mental state has effected him. 

I don't know how to fix it but it's making me so depressed and even more guilty that he been forced upon this roller-coaster of hell. I've tried talking to him about it, I thought maybe he wasn't attracted to me anymore. He said it's not that, he said he's still in love with me and still attracted to me but has gone from feeling like my lover to a caregiver and he can't seperate the two. I don't understand because as of now I'm still able to do everything myself. He's said he's had to think about my funeral and prople constantly asking him how I am all the time and he's sad and depressed a lot too. 

My fear is that he'll end up finding someone else. I'd rather he left me now than 2 years down the track, it would destroy me. I've told him I would completely understand if he needed to leave but he won't. I get the feeling it's more of a duty to him than actually wanting to be there. I could be wrong but my self esteem is very low at the moment because of this.

Her surgery was on Valentine's day. The doctor's called it the Mother of all surgeries. They only operated on her because she was in otherwise good health and she had a family. She is currently on round 2 of post surgery chemotherapy that is planned for the next four months. 

We adopted a special needs girl from China two years ago. I am having such a hard time with her as she has regressed into 3-4 year old behavior since cancer has struck.

Yesterday, my SO was rushed to the hospital for a series of seizures. When he arrived at the hospital, he went into cardiac arrest and was revived but he went into a coma. Now, he intubated and there's a machine breathing for him. The doctors found out he has bacterial pneumonia. His mom is with him thankfully, and now they're going to do a test to check if there is still brain activity

There's so much sadness that I don't really know how to process right now. He's only 23. He should've had his whole life ahead of him. It makes me so sad, but also just as angry! Why did it have to be him?!

Now, all this just happened during a strict enhanced quarantine which means that I can't even go to him!!! This isn't the way I wanted it to end......",2020-03-30 14:50:23

My mom was diagnosed a few weeks ago and just had surgery and is having a hard time recovering from it. I have taken off work everyday since our emergency room visit almost a week ago and have been her advocate at the hospital while she gets through this. I feel like it’s just what I have to do and I don’t want to be anywhere else. She is scared and really out of it and I feel like my just being with her helps her attitude and motivation. 

Because my husband makes good money, we’ve looked at our finances and can afford for a while (like up to a year for sure) for me to quit my job and take care of my mom. Has anyone done this? The way I look at it is that I would regret not being with her when she needs me the most WAY MORE than I would regret not being at school, especially if things don’t improve.

First time poster. My mom has been fighting breast cancer stage 4 for now 9 years and counting. It's been a long road for her and an emotional rollercoaster for me. I have also whitnessed her in and out of the hospital for surgeries and other significant health issues my whole life so probably have some form of PTSD from it all on top of a pretty significant anxiety disorder that my doctor ignores as 'work stress,' but I digress. 

 I have two siblings on my mom's side. Sister,18 and brother, 15. I'm 29. I know a lot of responsibility falls on me just because of that age gap. And it has.  After being in liver failure last March 2018, she has started chemo again and is now been hospitalized 3-4 times due to fluid accumulating and pain. I say 3-4 as I've lost count and it's really stressful.

Anywho. She'll be meeting with her oncologist tomorrow and I'll go with her as I've done now for the majority of her latest treatments aside from the beginning before she got honest with the severity of the cancer . These visits are boring, scary, and painful to see all at the same time for me and it causes great stress in my work and relationship with my husband and friends. 

Well, to get to the point of my post...l'm scared and tired. I don't want to sound cruel or anything but I don't want to be around her more than I have to. This hurts me a lot to say but it is so stressful, painful, and terrifying for me to hear about the symptoms, that she's in pain etc everytime I see or talk to her. I just want her to be okay. She's my best friend and I can't imagine her not being in my life.
 
This weekend, my husband and I hung out with family for goose hunting and it was great. Found out that she did the same and helped my aunt and uncle can from their massive garden. Last week she was hospitalized and we discussed my aunt and uncle will take responsibility of her health directive so I or my siblings don't have to. For that, I am so thankful. I can't express it enough how much I appreciate not having that burden. I love my family and am happy they can step up when I feel stuck, like I can't do it anymore. I'm thankful for them and I believe it will help me cope with it better. I can only hope.

 If you've gotten this far, thank you. Thank you for reading, thank you for the thoughtful posts on this subreddit. It helps. It helps me so I can be strong. It helps me so I can be there, all there when I have to be.",2019-09-10 02:13:01

For three years I have taken care of my mother who was diagnosed with liver cancer in the middle of my senior year of high school. I never missed a single session of her chemotherapy. I was there for ever moment that I could be there for her. Things had turned from bad to worse earlier this year the chemotherapy stopped working. She developed jaundice that is how we could tell the chemotherapy stopped working plus the countless of tests we went through. One week before she passed away her mind was slipping away very rapidly. I watched her fade away before my very eyes. I thought I mentally ready for this but I wasn't. The hardest part that I remember am that replays in my brain is the moment when I had to make the choice to send her to the nursing home or to let her stay at home. I sent her to the nursing home because I knew I couldn't be enough for her. She passed away six days later. They came and picked up and we had her memorial service that Wednesday. I wasn't prepared for it. It has been a little over five months now since she passed. I have realized that I was never there I was always at work making money to pay the bills. I also feel myself and my mind slipping away. I have lapses in my memory I forgot where I am at and what I am doing at times.

190,Metastasize Already!,8,cncsoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/cncsoy/metastasize_already/,2,1565246208.0,"I (F47) been my father's (M66) caregiver now for 2 years 8 months.  He has a rare cancer (Angiosarcoma - a 1% kind of cancer) and of the rareness of the cancer it is 1% of the group that has it on his face.

Jan 2017 was his diagnosis, then chemo until Jul where his heart was damaged (bundle branch block) and neuropathy became too much, so they stopped it. In December they started another chemo and within 2 weeks of his first infusion he was in the hospital with no white blood count.  January 2018 they decide to move to radiation and that started in March and finished in May when he said no more.  

So while the chemo and radiation helped keep it at bay (too invasive for surgery before or after these treatments to remove any of the tumours), the tumours are now quite active and he has leaking wounds in his face (brow, both cheeks, nose and now a new one which has bored it's way from cheek into his mouth.  He also appears now to have sores across his bottom gums (he has no teeth).  Add to that, that in January/March he had cataract surgery and then and three weeks ago he required a cornea transplant which has been another complication in his life.

All of this to say...he's an angry, depressed, very pessimistic man.  Back in March I almost told him to leave (he lives with me) as I could not deal with him anymore (my first post here).  In April, 1 week after coming back from a Cuba vacation with my sister, I did tell him to get out.  The support system we have here in Ontario (LINH support) was tried to find him a place to stay but during their search he changed his mind (though I didn't remember asking him too, lol).

End of  May one morning as I am just about to go to work he tells me he definitely wants to go to a Long-Term Care facility and I tell him okay, he should call his support worker and then he freaks out asking me why he should have to do that (um, you're a 67 year old man who can use a phone?)...but I do that for him.  This ends with him being admitted to the hospital as he tells them that he wants out of my home because he cannot care for himself anymore (forgets when to take medications, etc - but in reality he doesn't forget he was actually mad as they had just changed his meds and there were even 'more' pills) and so he stayed there for a week.

After putting himself there, wouldn't you know it, that night I get a call that he doesn't want to be there, he knows nothing, they won't talk to him, etc.  This call happened every day, sometimes twice and he wanted to go home, but they were not having it.  What they were trying to do was get his medications under control and see what worked, what didn't, etc.  He was released a week later, his medications are now bubble packaged to help him remember if he has or has not taken them etc.  Meanwhile, LINH support was still trying to find a place for him and they come out talk to him about some options and he decides he doesn't want to go there and he's staying.

It's now August...his wounds leak around the clock - he is understandably upset about it, his eyes (which were never the same after radiation) are not playing nice (cornea transplant one is still healing and almost sewn shut to help) and he's just been so negative that I really just want the cancer to move from his face and hit somewhere that will kill him.  I know that sounds so bad and evil, but when you hear your father say he just wants to end it...constantly (just heard it 15min ago when helping him with his eye drops), I just want it to be over. 

He's angry all the time that no one is doing anything for him (he has a daily nurse visit!), but he doesn't associate his wounds with his cancer which astounds me.  I try to calmly talk to him that they really cannot do anything if he's not opting for treatment...palliative is where he placed himself and it is only going to get worse. I am just so tired.  I love my father, I do, but this man has been like a child instead of father to me off and on since my early 20s with one mental or health situation after the other. 

Thank you for listening.

TL:DR I've been my father's caregiver for almost 3 years and his constant complaining, negativity and grumpiness is killing me and I want it to end.",2019-08-08 06:36:48

He developed some serious aggression and behavioral issues because of having treatment at such a young age. The biggest problem I'm having right now, though, is trying to get him to eat anything but junk. When he was sick, and going through his treatment, they told us that if he was willing to eat something, no matter what it was, to let him eat it. Well, that helped in maintaining his weight and growth while he was sick, but now I'm stuck with a toddler that won't eat real food, ever. 

I'm worried about his nutritional needs being met, and for a while, I could sneak things into his food and drinks to help, like supplements and veggie purees. Now, it's almost like he's figured out what I'm doing, and refuses anything that I can possibly supplement. It's frustrating and infuriating, and I'm at a loss as to what to do. 

Has anyone else ever run into this type of problem with children who underwent, or are currently going through treatment? I'm just so worried. He is starting to look sickly, and he's stopped growing as quickly again. ",2019-03-12 04:10:01

My mum has been battling metastasised breast cancer for around 3 years now. In the last month her health has gone downhill and nausea has caused her to loose a bunch of weight. Shes always been slim so she didnt really have the weight to loose. Shes also been very forgetful and having a lot of vision and balance issues. We thought this was a lack of food intake. 

However, yesterday she was taken to the hospital in an ambulance after dad found her nearly comatose. She has made multiple calls to myself and other family members confused as to where she is and paranoid about people hurting her. 
I went into the hospital last night and stayed until 2am helping her to sleep and she did calm down while I was there. The whole time she kept saying she was seeing cats and children running around. 
My dad called this morning, hes at the hospital now. She got even worse after we left the hospital.  

We have since learned that it's not malnutrition, its the cancer that spread to her brain lining causing the brain to swell. 
She was okay last week and I am really struggling with this sudden change and I'm scared that this is a sign I am loosing her. 
I suffer from severe anxiety and depression and my mum is one of my closest humans. I cant bare the thought of being without her. I became suicidal last year when she had her last flare up. 
On top of that, I run my own business and I have a very important event that I am meant to be flying overseas to attend this Thursday. My finances are wrecked and I'm relying on this event to feed my family for the next few months. But I'm feeling like I cant leave because I might be loosing my mum. I'm torn between the time I have right now with her, and any future I hope to have with my business.

My mother is dying. We made a promise my sister and i before she got really sick. We wouldn't put her in a nursing home. We would do everything in our power to let her be able to die at home with dignity. I feel like we we're to quick to agree cause shit's gotten real. Painfully real. I don't know if i know what happy is anymore. My heart literally aches daily. I barely can function. My marriage is so strained. My financial 
sistuation is almost to the point of me just giving up. Our life savings is gone!! 17 grand saved to buy a house but not anymore. We have exactly $249 in the bank and bills that total to 5 grand a month. 

My mother has bone cancer. This is her third cancer since 1999. First breast second uterine last but not least the killer. Matatisized from her uterine cancer fucking bone cancer the killer. 

She got into the keytruda studies. Dana Farber in boston is running trials cause Keytruda is a gene therapy. After all she has had her life time of chemo with her 2 other cancers. She had one of the genes they think will work with the Keytruda. 

She started off good in the spring but her doctor decided to give her surgery cause her bone cancer and cancerous masses were pinching a nerve that controls her leg. She was very alert last spring. Her doctor from Dana Farber told her her quality of life would be better.

My mother has always been so strong. Never depended on anyone for anything. She was very active with her daily life. She went with this surgery.

Things got fucked up during surgery. After all this was also experimental. The idiea is was to go in lapercopic and freeze the tumors and the Keytruda would attack the cancer cells that might try to excape to other organs in turn they hoped for a better quality of life.

That surgery went wrong. The doctor froze the nerve to the leg. Wich made het immobile. That surgery landed my strong mother in to a nursing home that almost killed her. They gave her wrong meds she was there for a month. They didn't give her paxil for a month as well as her morphine and 20 mlgs xtra of her blood presure meds. They neglected her to the utmost degree. She left that place traumatized. As well as the family. We could sue but she didn't want to.

Wich leads us to today. Her decline is faster now. But before she got sick she made myself and sister promise that we wouldn't put her in a nursing home or have people in her house. She made it very clear that she wanted to die at home. 

As she declines the harder it is to keep her home. We found out she has tumors on her brain. She has three of them..they are pressing in all the wrong places in her brain. Sundowners is the worst. She forget to even know how to get out of her wheel chair. She is now a two person transfer. We have to diaper her daily/nightly. 

She fights myself and sister about safety issues. She will not get out of her wheel chair into her safe chair. Berrnie n Phil awesone chair that lifts her from a sit to a standing position.

Taking care of our mothers needs is so time consuming. I have a full time job wich starts at 10thirty but for me to get there on time i have to get to my job so I'm at her house at 6thirty am. Sometimes i don't leave untill ten brcause you cant rush her or she'll cry. 

So for hours litterly she will look at the tsgs on the clothes that I'm gonna dress her in. She needs to inspect everything. She takes 1/2 an hour to take her meds. She thinks my sister and i are trying to poison her. She has severe paranoid thoughts. Thinks were stealing her clothes. And my loving mother has turned into this mess of a mean mother to a out to lunch lunatic meaning her brain is toast. 

We need to get help in there. My sister has little kids. Her and her husband seperated over this with my mom needing all this care and help. My husband and i fear are one fight away to the same fate.

The care is extremely exhausting!! Plus working on top of it. Something has to break. We dont want to put her in a nursing home. But she's one fit away from becoming combative. She swats at us now. She has hauled off and giving a quick left handed upper cut. It was so fast. I know i can't take that personal but...

I'n so over tiered. I cant stand that my mother is loosing het mind. Are we supposed to see our parents so vulnerable. 

A girl.at work caught me cryimg cause i do that daily too becaude i feel so guilty that i'm not doing enoughf for her or if she really knows it's almost time to leave us. She said to me "" once a child twice a mother "" i love that saying. That saying really does relate.

I whole heartedly am trying to mother my mother now. Is this why people put their loved ones on a nursing home? They can't take the pain of watching death get closer. I can tell you it fucking hurts. If i could trade places i would. I feel so unbelievably sad and want this all to end in a good way. If she ends up in a nursing home i don't think i could live with myself. 

I just need a little me time to recharge.

The odds are not good for long term survival with 25% at 5 years and a 50 month average survival. All of this is just odds, and some people do make it past this. 

My wife’s blood counts are low, so they are planning a transfusion. The doctor is trying to limit her impact so is only giving her one unit today, with another CBC tomorrow and a potential second unit on Friday. 

She has a MRI on Thursday too for massed in her brain, spine and neck.

201,The Whirlwind,7,7sjtus,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/7sjtus/the_whirlwind/,5,1516788693.0,"Hi, my name is Todd. My wife of 20 years has been diagnosed with Stage IV Lung Cancer (Metastatic Non-Small Cell Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma) She has METS in her brain, skull, lumbar spine, orbital sockets, adrenal glands, bladder, hip, and bowels. I'm sure there are more but these are the ones that stuck in my mind. The strange thing is that the largest mass is in her right orbital socket. 

Starting in late October, my wife started to get ""floaters"" in the peripheral vision of her right eye every now and then. As they got to be more consistent, she slowly started to lose the peripheral vision in the top part of that eye. Not having insurance, she put off going until we had the money. Our thinking was that her glasses/contacts RX had changed.

On December 5th she went to the local eye Dr. to have an exam. Dx: Detached Retina. 2 hrs later we are at the Retinal Specialist. He takes one look and I can tell by the immediate look on his face that it isn't good. He called it an ""Abnormal mass of cells"" 2.7cm x 1.1cm x 0.9cm. They schedule us an appointment to see an Oncologist.

See the Oncologist 2 days later and they order a PET scan and a MRI of the skull and orbits. The next Friday they drop the bomb on us. My wife had 3 biopsies(sp) done. The first 2 were inconclusive but said that the best educated guess would be Malignant Melanoma because my wife is a redhead with fair skin. 3rd biopsy was an actual surgical procedure to make sure they get enough material to get all of the genetic markers that they need to give a rock solid Dx.

In the meantime, my wife starts a series of 10 whole brain, orbital socket, and lumbar spine radiation treatments. This past Thursday they threw us a bit of a curveball when they told us that it was actually lung cancer and not melanoma. They didn't use the phrase ""terminal"" but did say incurable.

Radiation started January 3rd and in just this short time, I have watched my beautiful wife turn into a shell of her former self. As expected, she lost her hair. Though she has an oddly beautiful shaped head sans hair. She has gone from someone who you would never see sitting still, to sleeping 18+hrs/day. When she is awake she is resting in my new (her new) recliner. Her appetite hasn't been effected yet, but I know that with chemo, that will change.

I am so terrified about starting chemo. I am watching who she was disappearing in real time. I feel like the center of my universe is being swallowed by a black hole. I am trying to stay strong for her, but they facade is starting to crack. 

I had a back injury over the summer and was unable to work. I just got cleared to return to work and then....boom. I can't work now because she requires a constant caregiver and her need for me will only continue to grow as this progresses. 

Don't get me wrong, there is no other place I would rather be than right by her side helping/demanding that she fight as long as she can. We have 2 children that are 23 and 16. Not babies, but still to young to be losing their mother. My 16 yr old son has Autism and this is going to destroy him. She is everything to him. She is everything to all of us, but he really leans on her. He has overcome so much, I hope that this doesn't cause him to regress.

Sorry this is so long. I just had to get it out. I am trying to stay strong for her and the kids but I have my moments when I can't be strong. I'm losing my best friend, confidiant, the love of my life, and it is crushing my soul. I wish I could take it from her and suffer in her place.

Today we found out that her cancer has spread to her cerebral spinal fluid. This sucks. I'm having a hard time holding it together right now but I don't even really know how to process it. 

I can't even begin to describe the horrible experience we had with the hospital that led up to this. I know this is a terrible diagnosis. I know what it likely will mean. She was doing so much better. :( She was going to be cancer free when she finished this chemo. Why can't we just get some good luck???? She's only 60. This isn't fair.

As we approached the treatment facility, Dad began to complain about needing to use the bathroom. We hit every red light, of course. I dropped him off at the door to the building and went to the parking garage. I noticed a large wet spot on the passenger seat. Sopped it up with napkins from my glove box. I cried. This is too much. I won't say anything to Dad. I know that he'd be embarrassed. Not telling Mom either, she'd berate him for it. Ughhhh. Fuck cancer. Fuck these early appointments.

210,Anger,6,jjp0go,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/jjp0go/anger/,10,1603924974.0,"    I know that Anger is a part of grieving, but I feel guilty for feeling so much anger towards my husband of 28yrs who is going through Lung Cancer, which is now a stage4. 
   The tumor is massive. 9cm. They were able to get it to shrink by 2cm,  through radiation, to open the airway. The things is, they said he could live with it as long as they can keep it from growing and spreading. 
    With death standing in our front yard, I don’t understand why he won’t do what he’s told to do by the doctors. 
     He refuses to eat. Not because he’s nauseous. He says he just doesn’t want to. Then he complains and wants sympathy because he has no energy and can’t walk very well. If I try getting him to eat even a small amount of anything, he gets angry. He sips water occasionally, then tells the doc he gets 32oz a day (getting mad again when I say I don’t believe it’s that much). He refuses to admit he smokes, but goes to the garage and I can smell it when he comes back in (he goes out there when I leave the room and doesn’t need help walking. When I catch him, he makes up some lame excuse why he needed to go out there). He got mad when I explained to him that if he doesn’t eat/drink he’s going to be back in the hospital, but it’s the truth. To him “eating” is drinking 2oz of Boost and eating one 4oz pudding cup for the entire day. 
   It’s so frustrating and irritating that he puts himself into situations where he wants sympathy, then refuses it. He moans as he’s talking very quietly, and gets mad when I can’t understand him (miraculously able to speak clearly as he’s stating that I don’t ever listen). He talks bad about the kids not coming to see him, but when they ask if they can, he makes them feel bad for trying to spread germs to him, so they don’t. 
   His brother told me it’s like a wounded dog. He hurts and needs me but will nip at me because he hurts. And that I don’t need to be so sensitive. What the hell am I suppose to do? Allow him to not eat or drink?!! Allow him to yell at me and make me feel like a worthless wife because I don’t know what he wants?!!! 
   He thinks he has at least 10yrs left. I think he has 6 months tops (like I said, the tumor is huge, while on chemo it spread to his liver and adrenal glad. He refuses to eat. How can a body survive that). I just want our last bit of time to be of good memories, not this. 
    Please tell me it’s okay(?)/normal(?)/acceptable(?) to get so mad at him while he is in the process of dying. If I’m wrong, I’d appreciate someone..anyone...tell me that I am! I just want my head where it needs to be so I can deal with this!!

*I want everyone to know that I talked with the Oncology Nurse today. She is going to note in his file the slim amount he has eaten in the past week and put in my request for some sort of appetite stimulant. I can’t express how much your responses have helped me today.

My  mom was diagnosed with anal cancer when she went in to have hemorrhoids  removed in the spring of 2012. I was living out of state and actually  had gotten injured myself the day I was told. I was new to my job, which  caused the injury, so I couldn't take time off to see my mom. She had  chemo & radiation, and was good to go by fall. She actually flew to  see me for a few days when I had my surgery.

I  got a settlement from work, my girlfriend graduated college, and we  moved back to my parents in 2015 to recover and help my parents out  while they looked for a smaller house. Mom wasn't really able to take  care of the house anymore due to her low energy levels. We started a  nice home based eBay business so I could help my parents out and my  girlfriend got a job for the health insurance. We realized that they  just weren't going to move because I made their lives so much easier, so  we started looking for houses, then we got the call.

In  July 2017 her last scan after 5 years found new cancer in her right  lung, they immediately removed the lower lobe. For some reason and  against guidelines, she was not given antibiotics. She got a bad  infection and spent 2 weeks after her surgery in the ICU. That stopped  us from looking at places, I had to take over her babysitting that  summer because she still insisted on seeing all the kids in the extended  family.

She found out 3 months  later that they missed some of the cancer and she needed more chemo and  radiation. Winter of 2017/18 was spent with my stepdad taking her 4 days  a week on round trips to the cancer center that's over 40 miles away  for radiation and me taking her once weekly for a four hour chemo  session.

Fall of 2018 her cancer  metastasized to the brain, she had to go to Pittsburgh for Gamma Knife  treatment. Spring 2019 it came back, more Gamma Knife. It was fine for a  few months, then in the fall a scan revealed that the cancer was  basically all over her torso. She called all her friends out in January  to see them one last time, and committed to another round of chemo, she  has had her lifetime allotment of radiation. The chemo was once every 3  weeks and took a terrible toll this time, she actually developed an  allergic reaction to one of the chemo drugs and they had to switch to  something else mid-treatment.  It didn't shrink the tumors, but they  didn't grow. They told her that she would need to be on the chemo once  every 3 weeks for the rest of her life. She chose to forgo treatment and  start hospice.

Its been a few  months on hospice and she is in a great deal of pain and very nauseous.  They aren't really sure if it's all the painkillers or the cancer but  she has been on everything to stop the vomiting, but still has issues.  She's lost so much weight and recently lost the ability to walk or even  hold herself up really.  I don't think she has long left, weeks maybe.

Mom  has the Medical Cannabis card and I make her edibles, and roll her  joints. She had me make her 50mg gummies with distillate, they help her,  but sometimes she doesn't want them because she will eat too many and  sleep. I made her peanut butter cookies for the 2017/18 chemo, and she  was actually able to put on weight during the treatments. She was  refusing the edibles during her last treatment, said she hated that they  tasted ""too weedy"". She was smoking cannabis, as she had since 1974. I  looked into it and found the distillate does not have the same taste  because of how it's made and now make sure she is stocked with joints  and gummies to help her be comfortable.

I  am trying to do the best I can for her as her caregiver, my dad helps  but he works full time and is dealing with his own health issues. He is  diabetic, needs a double knee replacement, & waiting on test results  right now to see if the spot on his kidney is cancer. His younger  brother is dealing currently with kidney cancer that was recently  discovered to be growing into the spine, making it inoperable. His  little sister is dealing with MS. Dad is severely depressed, not  sleeping, and not really able to help much. He was looking at a small  house to buy, but now I kinda worry that he won't leave and I will have  to care for him while he goes through treatments, or refuses treatments  in his depressed state. I don't know how to help him.",2020-09-01 21:50:02

Okay so for starters, I have a handful of mental health issues and so I’m not the happiest person ever ya know. One of the disorders is obsessive compulsive disorder. And so It gives me a severe fear of others dying and me feeling responsible even though I’m not so I have to do the compulsions to get rid of the fear that loved ones will pass. 
So my boyfriend and I are both 19. He’s been diagnosed with Acute leukemia and his is more treatable than others which is incredibly lucky so I’m thankful for that. He’s been getting treatment since September 2017 I believe, and his treatment ends in the new year.. so, soon. He’s having a difficult time coping with the idea of not taking chemo medications anymore out of fear that it’ll return.. which IS possible. I go to every single hospital visit for his chemo, I drive him there and home, buy him breakfast before hand or help him fall asleep. But he keeps his emotions to himself. And I know that having cancer and losing so much of your life would be hard to process. He missed his high school graduation because he couldn’t walk. He spent so much time away from normal kid things he never got to experience that. He keeps his feelings in and every so often starts to act funny. I’m super good at talking to people about emotions so I tried to help him open up so he can get some pressure off his chest and he just cried. And I don’t know what to even say when he does. I go on and on about how he’s worth so so much and that this makes him stronger than everyone else and that life has so much more to offer. And I try to find as many positives and opportunities as possible for him but I mean, what can you even say? 
Note: If it did come back after his treatment ends, they would do a bone marrow transplant and that’s the last option. If that fails, there is nothing they can do for him. which makes the whole situation even more scary since he has to live knowing it could come back right? 
I can’t help him physically so I want to mentally help him but I don’t know how. When he does open up he always feels better after but it’s hard to start the conversation because he’s trying to hide it. I’ve suggested writing his emotions in his notes but he can’t seem to find the words. 
I know he’s really hurting inside and I hate watching this happen to him. 

Any tips would help if you’ve experienced something similar. Or just coping mechanism for yourself (because I sometimes break down over it but I can’t let him see that I’m scared too because I wanna make him feel stronger)

He was on an experimental treatment but didn’t get a bone marrow transplant and chemo until August 2018.  Besides gout from the chemo pop was fine until suddenly that October he was diagnosed with hosts disease and stayed untll A few days before Halloween 

We thought he was going to be fine until a few days after Christmas but before New Year’s Eve he got a fever and had to be taken to the ER.

Pop stayed there again until maybe March-May where he was diagnosed with cancer in his hips which he got radiation for and I think leukemia (even though it’s practically the same as the blood cancer). He was also defecating in the hospital bed dropping to 100 pounds. Pop went to rehab in February.

After a stint in the hospital from May-June pop was able to come with us to Florida and go on the rides at Disney even though he had to be pushed around in a wheelchair for almost Everything. 

Really can’t remember much of July-October but In November he was back to the hospital and we found out he didn’t have a long time to live - cancer in his heart and brain that couldn’t be treated which meant the only option was living the last of his days out in the hospital or end of life home hospice care.

Pop didn’t want to be in the hospital anymore so the hospital gave him painkillers, a few other things and a plastic potty in case he couldn’t make it to the bathroom even despite the attached bathroom. 

Pop started getting delusions and hallucinations in December: he told aunt crystal he was going to the beach one Friday when it was 41 degrees out telling her there was sandwiches out in the garage waking around in his underwear telling me it was a bathing suit and making a seat in the (pretend) sand with a blanket and his walker. 

Two nights before Christmas when I was closing up my laptop at 3am from playing sims he came out and got dressed telling me he was going to the store but eventually decided not to go. Pop also talked to his imaginary friend George. Now there’s another friend named Thomas 

Yesterday Aunt Crystal told me that pop was seeing dead people. He was seeing the deceased husband of grandmas sister Louise. She thinks he’s seeing people he liked but grandma told me he didn’t like Sal. Then he said, “they’re here” aunt crystal also wants to know who the “they” person is as well but believes that the spirits are trying to take pop however he keeps protesting.

I wonder what unfinished business he has left as it was already mine and grandmas bdays in November, thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years so what could be keeping him here? 

I don’t get why he’s still clinging: he’s clearly in tons of pain and miserable. Our state of New York doesn’t have legalized suicide yet which could’ve taken him out of his misery 

This morning At 4am a still awake me (hit my head on the dresser since aspergers affects my cerebellum and couldn’t fall asleep when I tried to at 12am) heard pop fighting with grandma. He had to go shit and grandma was trying to get him to go to the bathroom before he shit in the bed again (she cleans the sheets almost everyday as he bleeds very easily and of course shits in the bed since he’s like a baby now).

Grandma got my moms brother Uncle Jason to help her as he was getting ready for work in a few hours and they got pop to shit but he wouldn’t get off the toilet and walk back to bed to the point where grandma bad to threaten him with the ambulance. 

Today grandma took off from school bus driving to take care of pop.

So much stress on her",2020-01-10 20:15:25
222,Insight/advice?,5,e57mqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/e57mqi/insightadvice/,15,1575358194.0,"Hey all, new here. Been thinking about finding a caretaker sub for a while but have always felt a little guilty about airing my personal struggles online for people to look through. Today has just been a really tough day and could some insight/personal stories to help me process my thoughts. 

Background: 
My boyfriend and I have known each other for just over a year but have been officially together for about 9 months. About a month and a half into our relationship he was diagnosed with a mediastinal germ cell tumor. Immediately we began treatment which consisted of 8 hour days of BEP (cisplatin mix) at an infusion center an hour from home. Luckily, I am a high school teacher and summer had just begun so I was able to transport and be there for all of his infusions. 

After 3 cycles that spanned over all of summer vacation, we were transitioned to a new cocktail (TIP) that requires week-long in-patient treatment. 

Current status:
Currently, today’s scans show his AFP levels are excellent (2.7) but the mass of teratoma keeps growing, putting pressure on his heart and lungs. He sees a cardio thoracic surgeon in a couple days to see if it’s operable, but the oncologist isn’t optimistic. I won’t be there as I am out of vacation days, but his grandmother is flying in from out of state to be there with him. 

Since he has began treatment, he has lost over 60 lbs. and it seems to barely be stabilizing. He doesn’t eat hardly anything and refuses to try Ensure or similar meal replacement products. This is partly due to the normal loss of appetite attributed to chemo but also because of constipation as a side effect of his opioid pain killers. He had his last infusion about a month ago and his primary isn’t going to proceed with more. 

His energy levels are at an all time low; making the bed is enough to put him in bed for the rest of the day. Mostly, he watches tv or is on his phone and fades in and out of sleep all day. Because of this, his sleep pattern is all out of sync and he seems disinterested in almost everything. 

My struggle:
1. Diet. How can I help support him in eating better and taking in more fluids? We don’t have the longevity of a marriage or years behind us so I struggle with saying things like “do it for me.”  He does listen to me for most things but in this area he gets really stubborn. Also, the fear of a bowel movement is a strong hinderance for him to eat as some are so painful that they bring him to tears. 

2. Burnout. Despite seeing a therapist bimonthly, I am still struggling with caretaker burn out. There are times I want to get out of the house but I feel guilty for leaving him at home. We don’t live relatively near any friends or family that come visit with any sort of frequency. Also, things I want to do he shows enthusiasm for as well but then is exhausted after only having left the house for 30-45mins. I don’t want to disappoint him by telling him that I want to go out for longer than he’s going to have the energy for. 

3. Managing life while being supportive. He is active duty military so luckily he doesn’t have to deal with medical bills. That’s not to say that all the other expenses not covered by insurance aren’t overwhelming us. I work full-time as a HS teacher and moonlight as a server/bartender on the weekends. All of my teaching “sick days” I have used going to appointments and being there for him. I am exhausted 24/7 as I pick up as many extra hours at school as I can and work at least one day every weekend. Bills are getting covered but I feel like life is slowly slipping away from me as sometimes I don’t have the energy to do much else. I will continue to take as many days off of work as necessary to be by his side, but am worried how I can handle it all. 

Don’t get me wrong, I love him to death and will be by his side no matter what. I just needed to vent a little and am maybe hoping people are out there who went/are going through similar situations that they might be able to offer advice. Thank you!",2019-12-03 07:29:54

224,"Mourning a loss, but not a death",8,dt9dg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/dt9dg4/mourning_a_loss_but_not_a_death/,4,1573212177.0,"I left my partner today. He has cancer. He's had it since before we met.


We've always struggled with division of emotional labour within our relationship. When he gets overwhelmed or upset, he shuts off. Whenever he shuts off, I'm left picking up the pieces by myself. He made some progress over the past year, but it was all the product of me *begging* him to address these behaviors.


Today, we got into another fight about a decision he'd made regarding something between us that I didn't agree with. We'd been fighting about it on and off since Saturday. Finally, I found out his reason for this decision, and it turns out that it's tied to something I did months ago that upset him. I didn't even know until today that it upset him. He never addressed it, so what could have been a 10 minute heart-to-heart over what I did the day or even week I did it turned into months of a grudge festering, and him trying to put rules on me that I did not find fair and eventually I just refused to agree to.


Despite all this, I love him dearly. We were otherwise doing well lately. His health has also taken a turn, but we were navigating it as best we could. I spent a lot of time fearing for his passing, but I was building up my own support system so as to not burden him with those fears since I knew he was already carrying fears of his own on that. I'm absolutely devastated that I won't be by his side if/when he does pass. I'm devastated to lose him. I could't carry the relationship on my own, though. I couldn't keep putting energy into conflicts that he was spending more energy trying to retaliate in than resolve. I couldn't keep cutting him slack due to his health. I couldn't take care of myself and him and us all at once.


I'm still going to miss the absolute shit out of him. I thought I'd be more relieved. I know I made the right choice, but I so desperately wish things could have gone differently. I love him, but for my sake I cannot be with him.",2019-11-08 11:22:57

She hates my son because he had been exhibiting signs of mental illness for years before he was finally diagnosed.  He had some pretty disturbing things to say.  The doctors say this was probably due to the growing tumor.  I’m not asking that she see her brother.  She won’t let me see my 4 year old grandson or even tell him that I love him.  I am heartbroken.,2019-09-29 03:08:25

My mom almost two months ago was given a month to live. I'm wondering if it's the end, I'd love some opinions.

Obviously for the past few months she has been getting weaker and weaker, she can still eat/drink/swallow, and even gets out of bed to go to the bathroom (with either a walker or wheelchair). Yesterday she had a good day, being wheeled around the house while my dad and I cleaned/decorated for her. Two nights ago she was confused in the middle of the night and was slurring her words, it got better in the morning, but it returned last night and has not left (it is now almost noon and still slurred words and confused). She still gets out of bed to use the bathroom and sits up in bed to eat cereal. 

Her cancer is in the brain and liver, and I know both brain mets and liver failure can cause delirium/slurred speech, but so can being in the last few days of life. It's so difficult that we don't know how much longer she has. Obviously the most I can do to try and figure out how much longer she has is to read stories from other people who have gone through this. I just hope that she is not in this state for several more weeks or months. I would hate to see that. 

Before her symptoms were controlled with meds she was confused as well but it quickly turned to being scared/paranoid. I don't mind if she is a ""happy confused"", asking me about my fishing trips (I don't fish) or about going on a limo ride (huh?). I just hate to see her suffer.",2019-09-09 00:43:22

We are waiting for the oncology appointment but have been told that it’s too late for surgery.  They said that they will look at chemotherapy. 

I feel that I really need to find out as much as possible what is going to happen.  

I feel so out of control.

230,I'm just crumbling under the weight of it all,6,cek7pu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/cek7pu/im_just_crumbling_under_the_weight_of_it_all/,8,1563432942.0,"Eeegh! I (21F) had a plan. I had a freaking plan! Stop taking care of the household, of my two brothers, my father, cleaning the entire house, and just focus on working more to help with the finances, move out with my mother and just take care of her.

I was ready to move. I was saving money. I am working nearly every day and than.. it happened. My father had an accident at work and can barely walk. His legs are completely swollen and he can't breathe through the pain. He just takes painkillers and tries to sleep. My mother can't breathe, her lungs are filled witg fluid once again, and she has to go to the hospital. 

I now have to take care of my household once again. He can't go to work and he doesn't want to go to the hospital right now. I can't move out, I have to stay arround and help. Idk anymore. Every time I take a step forward life knocks me down. I don't know anymore. I have to with my mother back to the hospital were we'll probably have to stay for a couple of days. I always go with her and stay with her to make her feel safe and because I help the nurses and her (with things like showering). But now my dad is telling me that he can't move and that he is going to need my help aswell. And I also have to work everyday to try to take care of everything. I feel like I can't breathe. 

My mother had some trouble sleeping these couple of days and I stayed up with her, and I'm just exhausted if life. I don't like this life. My whole body hurts. My way out, break of life, has been working out and last time I did that I fainted. I can't keep up with every thing. I even forget to eat, unless I'm working (cause than I atleast get a 30 minute break). 

I can't do this. I can't keep doing this. I've been slacking at home and I've been slacking at work and at everything in my life. I feel like I'm going crazy. All day I'm smiling at customers, while inside I'm breaking down. I can't do this. I've had a conversation with my therapist about it and he said that I had to talk to my mother about it all to see if she really did expect me to work, go to school, go to my internship, go to appointments at the hospitals, financially take care of the house, clean and cook and all of that. And I did. She does expect me to do most of it. She tells me that I don't have to go to the hospital if it's to much, but how can I not go to the hospital?

She's fucking dying, this is her last possible treatment. She's dying. The doctor said that I'd be lucky if had her for one or two more years. How can I just not go to the hospital when every day could be her last? How can I focus on class when she's dying at the hospital? It's not realistic. And that's the only thing that she doesn't expect from me. The rest I should do. Idk. She's also reached a point were she tells me how badly she wants to go. To just end it all. Wtf am I supposed to do? I can't breathe.

Ofcourse she's depressed the only time she leaves the house is to go to the hospital. What kind of life is that? She also doesn't want/isn't able to leave the hospital if she's not in a wheelchair, because she reached the point that she can't walk more than a couple of steps before not being able to breathe. She doesn't want a wheelchair though. And my dad doesn't want to go to the hospital. And both need to be cared for. I'm trying to not care for my piece of shit brothers (23 and 20) who refuse to help out in the house, financially or my parents. My brother doesn't want to bring my dad to the hospital. I have to. After I make breakfast, clean the house, and work an 8 hour shift, I'll have to bring him to the hospital. Than go back home to get my mother and bring her to her hospital, I'll have to somehow travel 45 minutes back to his hospital (idk why they don't go to the same one), bring him home, make dinner, go to her, sleep there (?) And get ready to go to work again. 

I don't know anymore. My mental health is already a fucking mess, but I guess that it's just all dumb. Life is stupid. It gives you people to love and than threatens to take them from you, not offering you a cure. and as the person you love more than life is fading away right infornt of you, you see the people who they loved become self involved monsters who only care for themselves. There aren't many good people, and all their friends get sick and tirwd of seeing your loved one being sick and tired. It happens to often so they call less and less, barely visir, apologize and say that life took over. And it did. Because they still have their life. But the truth is that the people who see their loved one die and care for that person are dying to. Every second they see them in pain, they're hurting. Every  sedond the person dies more inside, it feels like they're dying. But they're not. They're life goes on. They still have work and school and bills and people they know and will get to know. As THEY are dying, they also have to live. Life goes on, and you're expected to go on, strong. You've been strong for so long, when will you drop all the weight? 

When will you stop dying along their side and live your life? Will you ever stop dying along their side and just live your life? She's my meaning. My reason to keep going. My reason to breathe. Don't make others your reason. I made her mine, but now she's running out of time and I need another reason. She has other reasons. Why couldn't her cancer be mine. That makes me selfish. I want to take her cancer pain, but it will replace her pain with the pain of losing a daughter. I'm selfish, I'm still young I could fight her cancer better. I am physically strongee than her. I wouldn't mind being there instead of her. Because life would stop. I don't mind if life just stopped. 

I'm selfish and I know that it would hurt a lot less for me to lose myself than to lose my mother. I know my mother, I don't know myself. I love my mother more than I could ever love myself. I would just fight for her. And she'd be by my side and I'd be alright because she'd be by my side.

This is killing me and I selfishly want to die before she does cause I'm so tired. 
I'm tired of life everyone in my life. I'm tired of fake smiling and taking carw of everything and everyone. I'm tired of working everyday and barely sleeping and feeling sick and hospitals. I'm tired of the sound oh her coughing desperately trying to breathe. I'm  tired of hearing and seeing the changes in her as her lungs fill up. I'm just tired of fighting and trying to be strong. I'm tired of crying and trying not to cry. I'm tired if everyone at work finding out that she's sick and them looking at me with pity. I'm tired of not recognizing the woman who have birth to me. She may still be alive, but the cancer killed her. It killed her smile, her joy, her innocence in the way she looked at the people she cared about, it killed her love for life. And she told me she doesn't want to fight death when it comes for her. 

I can't talk to my immediate family cause no one is there for her, no one seems to care or accept her reality. I can't talk to my extended family, because part of them just shout at me that I should get married, because than she can see me get married before she dies. The other part cares about her so much, that she told me to lie to them about how she's doing. So I'm alone. She's not with me anymore. Her cancer is all she can think about, it has consumed her. How could it not when it took her hair, than her energy, her ability to breathe normally and her ability to walk more than a few steps.
Every thing about her screems cancer. 

So I just go to work and take care if every thing and every one. 

You know what I'll say it. I'm mad at the world right now. I never thought the world owed me anything but fuck it. I'm mad at the world. I'm mad at by brother's for being bad people and hurting my mother and not helping and being selfish! I'm mad at my dad for acting like everything's fine and ignoring the fact that my mother has cancer and ia dying! I'm mad at my father because he'll never choose my side and if he had raised men instead of little boys thinga would've been different. I'm mad at my father because I warned him about my little brother and told him many times that he is never going to get an education and he's going to.hang out with the wrong people and get himself in some trouble with the law, and he didn't believe me. And now my little brother has been dropping out of schools like it's his job, when he doesn't have a job he steals money from us or sells out stuff. He owes the government and his ex schools a lot of money and he's getting worse. I'm mad at the doctors for telling us her cancer was gone and than later telling us that it wasn't gone and that it has spread and became worse. I'm mad at the doctors of ignoring her pain and claiming that it was a side effect. I'm mad at myself for believing and trusting in them because they're doctors. I'm mad at my personal trainer who told me that I was just trying to make my mother's illness about myself. I'm mad at the people who come visit my mother without telling us first and than expecting me to serve them drinks and foods the whole time that they're here. I'm mad at cancer for being cancer. I'm mad at life for sucking. I'm just mad. I'm also just mad cause I'm sad. I'm also mad because every time I cry I get a migraine, which is like life telling me ""oh you're sad, here bow now you're also in more pain! You're welcome!""

I'm mad at myself for complaining, cause there are people out there dying. But than I also remember that so is my mother so that makes a little sense. I just wanted to get that off my chest and be a little bi*ch just being mad and sad and upset.

I have always believed in natural treatments and prevention and have always disagreed with western medicine and their practices. It looks like my dad is literally in hell and I just don’t know how long a human should do this. It seems like cruel and unusual punishment to me. They’re saying even if everything goes 100% perfect and he does get better, recovery could be 2 years only to provide him another 3 years tops. Plus some of the issues he is dealing with could be permanent so he is just trading in one sickness for another. Is this worth it!?! Maybe something is wrong with my brain and my perspective, but imagining him going through this for the next few years just does not click in my head.

Maybe this is the way I was raised or my family dynamic, I don’t know. I just want to be clear headed and a good person, but my family has never been close. My dad has been single and living alone for a very long time so all he has is the damaged relationships with my brothers and myself.

My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 throat cancer 5 years ago. After chemo and radiation, he was cancer free for 5 years. (The radiation on his throat was really tough, he tolerated chemo well. ) Cancer returned in his lung this spring. Chemo really hit him hard this time around. Terrible nausea, fatigued and out of breath. He’s 67. He’s always been positive and wants to live. 

My 71 year old mom is his caretaker. On top of that, she works part time from home, watches my niece (2.5) and nephew (4months) 20-30 hours a week and takes care of house. She rarely accepts any help or gets upset if you just do something helpful. 

Their relationship has always had tension. Mom is more critical/withholding, while my dad is more emotional/sensitive. He’s been on antidepressants for 20+ years, my mom has untreated anxiety issues. I love them both, but have a closer relationship with my dad. He’s been a constant support, especially with my own depression and anxiety. I have an older sister, we have our own issues but are able to put them aside, to help our parents. She takes after my mom and expressed she’s mad at my dad because he wasn’t eating and ‘every time she tries to help it bites her in the ass’. 

The recent chemo worked to keep cancer at bay for now, but more will be needed in the future. Last week he was very nauseous, fatigued and short of breath, last chemo treatment was a month ago. He was complaining every tasted bad, ate little to nothing and slept a lot. Because of some insurance/doctor issue, he’s been off one of his antidepressants for a week. I gave him a daily pep talk, he wanted to eat, but felt something was just not right. I suggested mom call his doctor. I’m not sure if she did or not. She kept saying his last blood work came back fine and it was all mental, that he’s doing this to himself, telling him this frequently. Saturday morning she finally had enough and we took him to the ER. When my dad was talking to the doctor, she was rolling her eyes and chiming in and telling the doctor he just needs a psych consult. I had to step out of the room because of the tension. In the hallway, the doctor told me her concerns about their situation and that my mom was burnt out, I agreed. I finally was able to convince her to go home and nap. 

My dads tests results came back, his hemoglobin and white cells were extremely low and needed a blood transfusion. Ultimately he needed 4 units of blood. They also found a few stomach ulcers. Both the ER and hospitalist/inpatient doctor highly recommended palliative care for extra support, or at least family therapy. My mom doesn’t see the need and was upset it was suggested. My dad was in favor of it. After 4 days in the hospital, he’s home and feeling kind of better. He understands he needs to eat. My mom was upset he only ate 1/2 of the 3 egg omelet she made. Her getting upset makes my dad feel guilty. They rarely speak or spend time together. 

I bought up the suggestion of palliative care to her yesterday, explaining what services/support it can offer. That just upset her and she exasperated “fine, if you and your dad think it would help, just do it, but I don’t see the need.” I know she stressed, frustrated and growing resentful. All understandable given her position. My sister seems annoyed by all of this and thinks my dad just needs to try harder. (I agree with that, but know getting upset with someone isn’t a great motivator.) 

I left a message with the oncology social worker about palliative care yesterday. 

I’m frustrated and not sure what my place in my family or caregiving is. I want my dad to get the care he needs (medically and emotionally) but me getting involved only seems to cause more friction with my mom and sister. I don’t think she realizes it, but it seems slightly abusive. I’m really concerned about both of them.

Update (6/12/19)
Dad is still loosing weight, having difficult time eating and has been vomiting/diarrhea for the past 4 days. He’s very anxious and feels he’s disappointing us by not eating more. When I saw him yesterday, he admitted to me that living with my mom is causing a lot of stress and he tries not to tell her too much because she’ll get upset. I asked him to share a few things with my mom while I was there and she wouldn’t have it, “you’ve said that before and I’m done talking in circles about it.” 

He was planning on going back to his part time job today, because he doesn’t want to upset my mom. Yet he didn’t want to sit outside with me yesterday because he felt too weak to walkout there (< 20ft away). I asked him how he plans to go to work if he can’t make it outside. He’s afraid to do a lot of things because it would upset my mom and told me “you should hear what she says when no one is around.” I just sat with him, hoping to help him calm down. I tried to show him some breathing exercises, tried to distract him with stories or things he’s interested in, showed him photos or funny videos, things to look forward to, etc. Worked for a little while, but he’d bring the convo back to his situation quickly. I find medication videos helpful for my anxiety, so I suggested we listen to a short one, he refused to try it, saying “I just enjoy talking with you, I can’t talk like this to your mom or sister.” I appreciate and understand why, but it’s frustrating. I can’t be his only emotional support system, especially when he tells me about their marriage or how my mom and sister treat him. I’ve explained it puts me in an awkward position and makes me upset with mom and sister. That doesn’t help anything. 

Anyway, While I was visiting, I reviewed his meds and gained access to his online chart/health info. My mom is trying to stay organized, has print outs to track meds, food, vitals and notes. Good!!However, She keeps his meds hidden (won’t tell us where they are), dad isn’t aware of what he’s taking and I found some discrepancies in his meds from what my mom has been saying. She’s still been giving him low dose aspirin while he’s recovering from stomach ulcers. (She was not present to hear the doctor say not to, as she just waited in the car outside when he was being discharged and dad forgot his folder with discharge papers and info from dietitian.) She did call, hospital offered to print copies, but she decided they weren’t important. I get this is a lot. For anyone. 

He saw his primary care doc yesterday for follow up care for ulcers and help with eating. He was really hoping for an appetite stimulate, feeding tube or just to be admitted again. Doctor wanted blood work and took a stool sample for testing. While leaving the dr’s office, he got weak, vomited and had diarrhea, they sent him to the ER. He was sent home after blood work came back normal (hemoglobin was at 9, which seems low to me?) and took another stool sample. 

After I spoke with the social worker last week, I explained how they can help. My mom reached out to her (so did my dad, without either one of them aware they each called). But he’s got an appointment with a palliative care doctor next week! So that’s good news. I’ve also been in contact with a local non profit that offers counseling to cancer patients/families. 

In addition to all this,  it’s really hard for me to see my dad. The chemo transformed him into a sick old man. He doesn’t look like the dad I remember from even a year ago. When I was like young he worked in this loft above retail space. It was 2 flights of stairs, no landings or turns, just straight stairs. It seemed like he flew up those stairs. He’d run up and down them so quick, it seemed like he was flying. I tried so hard to keep up with him. Even now, 30 years later, I rush up stairs as if I’m Indiana Jones fleeing from a crumbling temple. 

I have a good support system but when I do socialize, I don’t want to discuss it much. Which is hard, because a lot of people ask. My dads passion in life has been sailing, mostly racing. He was a sail maker, coach, and very involved with it for 50+ years. We didn’t have a boat and I didn’t become interested in it until I was 20. He showed me the basics and told me to go sail with other people and find my own way. So I did. I didn’t tell people I was his daughter until they figured it out. I’ve made great friends and have adult relationships with my parents friends that knew me as a kid. This sounds awful, because I appreciate the concern and care, but it’s hard to have several people asking about him when I’m in my ‘happy place’ and trying to relax. It’s hard to keep retelling the updates or stories. 

Ok, I should stop. There’s more I could go on about but this is long enough.",2019-06-06 20:07:31
236,VENT Caregiving has caused me to hate my father,6,brq41k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/brq41k/vent_caregiving_has_caused_me_to_hate_my_father/,5,1558567485.0,"I already did some research online so my guilt for feeling this way has been helped. My father is the most difficult patient. When we go to the visits, he is the one causing a scene, being as asshole to everyone. He refusing the advice of the doctors, can't and won't take all his meds, and won't do any treatments that require him to go back to the hospital. I already know, being his daughter, that he is a narcissist. Since the caregiving jumped from part-time to full-time, I have really got to spend time with him and I thought it would be a good thing to get to know each other better since we haven't always been a close family. HUGE MISTAKE. I hate him to the core. His beliefs, morals, ethics, ideas about life and society. He is literally everything I hate in a human being and I believe this is why I left home when I was 17 and never went back. I'm 30 now and suffer from BPD and PTSD from my childhood. 

&#x200B;

I've always been so above and beyond with my help because it makes me feel good and acts of service is my love language. The problem is, with the way he is treating me and the rest of the world, I am now disgusted by this person. I don't want to be around him at all, let alone go above and beyond. Everything is difficult. Drinking water is a fight with him. This is causing me to now do the bare minimum. I literally just want to leave his food and medications on his night stand and be away as much as I can. I don't want to make my soups from scratch, I don't want to massage his legs, I don't want to just sit here and comfort him because every second of being with him is awful.  I understand he is in pain. I've been here since the beginning. I've been working hard on my compassion, empathy, and putting myself in his shoes to help me continue. This helps temporarily get me into the kind, generous mindset. I'll take a break and go to the gym and mediate, but as soon as I walk back in that door and he pisses me off, I'm back to anger. 

Whenever we try and show him proof that we need to talk care of our own health and mental health by taking a break and going to the gym, or going on a hike he says things like... your job isn't hard, IM the sick one, this is only hard for me. Or he tries to guilt trip me for leaving for 1 hour to go to the gym.. things like.. do you think this is a good idea? You better think about this before you leave? Fine I'll just die here. 

&#x200B;

I understand I sound like the asshole now but I don't care what you think, you're not here, you're not dealing with him. For those of you that are/have dealt with someone like this.. what do you do? I know this is common because I've read a few other stories.",2019-05-22 23:24:45

My mum was diagnosed with breast cancer 10 years ago, fortunately they caught it quickly, she had an op and that was that. Last Thursday mum was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). I am an only child with no other family members around for support. So I'm having to take time off from work at the mo whilst she's in hospital recovering from an op to have a stent fitted. She had a biopsy of her liver which we haven't had the results back yet but I understand prognosis for this type of cancer isn't great (to say the least). 

My friends have been really good recently and I know I cannot always rely on them, but today I'm really down and no one is free, I've drank almost a bottle of wine to myself and I wish I hadn't, but also it's given me an opportunity for the first time since mum's most recent diagnosis to cry, which can only be a cathartic thing. 

I just wondered what everyone else does to cope? I should add I'm not at all reliant on alcohol, but maybe once a week I'll indulge in some wine, usually it's every two weeks. 

Mum was always sole carer for my dad, but now the responsibility is on me for mum, and I always feel like I have to maintain this ""strong"" persona. I also have a 6 year old that lives with her dad (because of my lack of family support when my dad was dying) and her dad and my ex-MIL have been really good about it all (we aren't together anymore) but I've not been able to see her like I normally would whilst mum has been in hospital which has made me feel such guilt, which doesn't help. Add to that the guilt of me not being able to work for the last week or so. I feel like I'm living a nightmare. 

Also perhaps I should mention that I have never quite gotten over the death of my dad, it still gives me nightmares and some things have happened in caring for my mum that have triggered me and taken me back to that time. So I'm not really sure how to deal with that going forward. 

Should say I'm in the UK. But yeah, how did you all manage to look after yourselves? Sorry if I'm rambling. ",2019-02-23 04:35:39

My dad is on the autism spectrum and their marriage hasn't always been the strongest either because my dad tends to get overwhelmed when there is negative emotion in the area and he reacts dramatically to it. We had a family meeting that went poorly because my mom was having troubles with her port and was irritable because of it. After this, my dad texted my mother saying that he didn't want to be her caregiver and that he wanted to hire one. This is when I offered to be the caregiver if my dad drops out. He calmed down after a couple of days and is now assuming that he will be in charge. During winter break, I've been the one taking my mom to all of her appointments, and because of my dad's declaration, we talked to a social worker during one of these appointments about our options. The social worker said that it would be best if I took the semester off -I'm in college- and was the primary caretaker. I have no idea how to bring this up to my dad who reacts really badly to basically any negative news. We had the conversation with the social worker three days ago and I am clueless as to how to broach this to minimize the damage. I'm totally fine taking on the caregiver role. I'm a little bummed to be missing the semester because I have a lot of friends who are seniors and that means missing time with them, but my mom's health is ultimately more important.

My dad has stage 4 cancer and we recently found out that there is no cure anymore and that chemo may just make him feel worse. He has decided he wants to stop all treatment and wants to go home to spend his last moments with family and die at his house. I’ve been the main person taking care of him and it’s really hard for me but I know I have to respect his wishes. I let him know I support him with anything he chooses even if I don’t agree. 

I had him living with me for about week and a half to two weeks before I brought him to the hospital. These past night have been hard because we were staying in the same room. We were both sleeping on I think twin beds. It’s weird going to sleep and waking up not seeing him there. He is currently at the hospital. Today at 7 he is going to be discharged. 

He has a porta cath put in for no reason. We didn’t even get to start chemo. The biopsy was done after the porta cath, so we didn’t know how bad his cancer was until after the porta cath was put in. 

His cancer advanced so fast. I don’t think he will be with us for a long time. I just hope he doesn’t suffer a lot. 

I’m trying to spend a lot of time with him but I just came back to work (I work at a school). And I’m also a student at a university and don’t know if I’ll be able to finish my program. 

Please pray that he doesn’t suffer any more than he already is. That he is happy his last days. He’s in a lot of pain he isn’t even afraid anymore. ",2018-08-09 07:48:44

I feel him move and i open my eyes and see his big yellow (jaundice) eyes looking at me. He turns away quickly pretending not to look at me. I let him know I’m here.

I am very unexperienced in this, and my father cannot take it well emotionally, he forget things and he gets ""stunned"", I can't feel safe leaving him with mum sometimes. My siblings are all busy and abroad but it's unlikely they will partake in the caregiving of my mum. I have been overseeing my mum's well being these few days and it's really tiring. 

I have depression myself; I stopped working with the intention of figuring out my own life, but to my exasperation god decided to drop this bomb on us. I feel I have to do everything to make sure everything is ok; my friends cannot be of any emotional support to me, neither can my father; I have to be that emotional support for everybody instead.

And I was so stressed out that I have to resort to talking to inanimate objects to let go of some of the stress. Honestly I don't think I can make it alone, I had classes to attend and I spent a huge amount on the deposit; it's my dream and all I ever wanted to be. But I felt I had to give up on that and even without the stress of the classes I don't think I can make it through this.

I need support yet I can't find any. I had my own share of problems and I'm already struggling with it; only recently mum has become my only beacon of hope with the promise of trying to making me feel secure about my ""recovery"" and ""goals"" but all of that is shattered. They still continue to lie to me that I am going to be fine and I don't have to worry about this situation, but with my dad not really thinking through properly and my mum not yet knowing the diagnosis, I find this is it; I have to be the sole caretaker. I'd love to. It's not about me losing my dreams. It's about that I can't get any support and sometimes I am going crazy

I feel friends are useless, they don't reply upon my news. I just suddenly realised how alone I already am.

I have to be strong but I have no idea how. I know I have to be but this is just too much and my body is already taking the toll. I need to be healthy, strong, stable and positive for my mum and yet nobody can provide any kind of that support to me it's ridiculous!

Sorry for the rant. I am thankful for any feedback.

Edit: I have been her caregiver (with my dad) for 2 days, I am adapting fast and well, then I realised I really have no one to turn to. My mum is post operative hysterectomy; the cancer is discovered upon surgery, she doesn't know she has cancer and being more medically inclined I have been the person receiving the blunt end of the news.

His oncologist says it can take years for those side effects to go away. My dad is self employed and it’s hard for him to work when he can’t feel his hands and his legs are giving out.

Hi there! I have found out recently...well, the family found out, that our beloved mother is fighting stage 4 breast cancer that has spread to her pancreas and liver. The degree in which it is spread, I can't say I understood everything I was told as my older brother and dad are the dedicated medical info repeaters to keep our extended fam in the loop. This diagnosis came last week, though my mom had been going through some tests a few weeks before and I sensed something could be wrong.

Long story short, there are a lot of feelings in the air from everyone. Me, particularly, am the only sibling that lives outside of our home state of California. I grew up there but moved to NYC two years ago. I am currently not working , as I took time off to travel and live off of savings, but the topic has been approached of me moving back to help out as my older siblings have families of their own (though we've all been helping out with emotional support - esp grand kids keep my mom happy!). Me, on the other hand, I am a solo bird. No family of my own, youngest child growing up in the family, all that. 

I'm so saddened by this news of the cancer. What's worse is my mom feels guilty for making a ""burden"". In fact, the day before she officially found out, I had booked a multi continent solo trip and she insisted I still continue or else it would upset her if I changed my plans. This breaks my heart. Even at her worst, she puts others before herself.

A part of me thinks moving back home will help out. But a part of me is mourning also the loss of this life I built in New York City. Please excuse me for sounding petty and childish, perhaps even insensitive. I don't dare share these feelings outloud with the family but they are feelings I can't seem to get rid of. I feel like the ""right"" thing to do is to move. I'm in between jobs, and I've lived most of my life back in Cali so adjusting to life back there wouldn't be a problem. But on top of feeling sad for my mom, and my dad, and our family, I am feeling guilty FOR feeling sad to leave New York City.

My siblings having their own families, something that is ""theirs"". For me, i've never really had much I could call my own except for decisions and a life I've carved out for myself, esp starting over in NYC. Super cliche I know.

I feel extremely guilty for not wanting to leave NYC. And then I go into cycles where I wonder if things like that even matter. I should drop everything for the woman who raised our family, who never thinks twice to put her children ahead before herself. 

This may be more of a vent but feedback is appreciated. You can say I am selfish too, maybe that's it? Or is this disease simply the catalyst of an unplanned journey for everyone involved? Maybe these feelings are OK? I feel like I am mourning the loss of my mom, and our normal life as we know it. Our plans (collectively as a family and also individually, i.e. my parents living it up retirement lifestyle).

There’s not really much to say. My mother’s cancer is squeezing her intestines. She has a literal knot in her stomach that prevents her from eating more than a bit a day, if that. She can’t even drink. We’re lucky she’s doing any of it.

My sister and I had a much-needed yelling match. I’m ashamed to admit I hit her, but it got her to finally be honest about this whole situation, instead of screaming and yelling about stupid shit like moving the guitar chord rolls she hasn’t used in 10 years.

As stupid as it is... I can’t help but feel like we are responsible for Mum’s deteriorating health. I don’t know how much to push her to eat. Sister arguably pushes too much. Stepdad is there to help lift her and carry her, but Mum weighs so little now that I feel like I could carry her with my bad shoulder. She’s under 100 lbs. She’s basically a skeleton. The hospitals don’t do anything when we admit her, and the nurses she sees that administer chemo just say “you need to feed her more.”

We are trying. They aren’t there when she throws up from “overeating.” They aren’t watching her wither away. They aren’t there when she’s in a half-awake daze because due to starvation and a drug-induced stupor. Take off the drugs, and she’s in scream-induced agony — that after two years someone FINALLY admitted “yes, that’s the cancer causing that.” 

No one has said “There’s no hope.” No one has said “It’s terminal.” But I honest to gods wish someone would, so my mother could have at least had the option to die with her dignity in tact. She never wanted to go out like this.

252,Self Introduction,5,7anhuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/7anhuk/self_introduction/,7,1509783668.0,"Hi everyone,

My fiancee was recently diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer. I'm an American, she is Chinese, and we are currently living in China. It's been especially hard because I have to ask her what the doctor tells her, or wait to get translations of the tests back to really know what's going on. I can't ask the doctor questions directly.

It's been about 2 and a half weeks since her diagnosis. She's doing IV Cancer treatment (not sure what to call it) and she's done one session so far. The Doc initially told her once every two weeks, but pushed it to 3 since her WBC is too low (it's back up after some injections).

I am really hoping people can suggest two things for me.
1) She doesn't have many hobbies other than watching TV. Her work took up most of her time prior to the diagnosis, but now she's not working and doesn't know what to do with herself. Can anyone suggest some hobbies for her to try?
2) She is feeling trapped in the apartment. Her mom just wants her to rest and stay inside. As long as WBC is up, what are some things she can do?

Thank you all",2017-11-04 08:21:08

Sometimes she just has not taken her steroids because she didn't think she needed them. She has refused to read any of the support material the hospital has given her. She forgets things the doctor tells her and then gets angry at them for ""being sketch with me"", but if anyone tells her too much then she shuts down and says it's too much to digest. My sisters and I have been taking turns leaving our families and our jobs in another city to come and care for her and my dad (sick with other ailments).

She's emotionally drained and very short tempered. I walked in and she was in hysterics that my dad was ignoring her and what would have happened if she had something seriously wrong. I calmed her down and sat with her for a long time. 

A little about my situation, I'm 33 and married. My husband and I were living in California when my mom was diagnosed with Stage III cancer. She had her first treatment on that bout at the end of May, 2014 and we had moved back by July. We literally live with my parents, which is trying in itself. But necessary to help take care of her. 

She was originally told she would never get rid of her cancer, but they could make it smaller and less invasive. Well, the chemo/radiation got rid of it outside of the lung and only a 1cm nodule was left In her lung. About a year later, the nodule had grown a cm in a very short time. She was face to face with all of this again, but this time her doctor said it was operable. So they removed half her left lung robotically. She was in the hospital 4 days and then home with minimal pain. It was miraculous!

But now we are back to chemo. I cried with her today and told her I wish it were me. She of course said she wouldn't want that, but I just hate seeing her going through all this again. It sucks. 

She will be doing chemo every Thursday. For 2 weeks she'll do a long day (2 hours of fluids, 4 hours of chemo and 2 more hours of fluids) along with her 10 minute other chemo. Then the other 2 weeks she will only do the 10 minute chemo. I don't know the names of the drugs but I know one of them has a high level of metal in it, hence the fluid flush. 

I don't really know the point of this post, but I felt I needed to get it off my chest. I don't even know if anyone even reads this sub any more, but...oh well. 

I just hate cancer. ",2016-11-18 11:41:58

I’m writing to ask for some advice. My mom was recently diagnosed with a stage iv blood cancer and I have my first baby and her first grandchild due any day now. 

I go to my mom’s house every night after work to spend time with her and help with anything she needs. My dad, husband, and brother are also pillars of support for my mom and dedicate their time and effort to getting my mom better too. My mom is tough and doesn’t need me constantly hovering but I know she loves the company and it, selfishly, breaks my heart whenever I’m not with her during this time. 

I am worried however about balancing a newborn and giving my mom all the support that she deserves. My mom was so looking forward to becoming a grandmother and I don’t want her to miss out on any experiences that might entail. With that being said I plan to spend most of my maternity leave at my mom’s with the baby (with the oncologist’s ok and instructions for my mom to wear a mask when she holds the baby) but I still get worried about the little germs babies carry compromising my mom’s health. Just want to be as good of a daughter and as good of a mom as I can.

It's been over six months since my mom was diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer (metastasis to both lungs, ovaries, and liver). She has been doing chemotherapy every two weeks and last week was her first CT scan (there were a few more in-between, but it was during a hospitalization). Unfortunately, her colon tumors have gotten bigger, which my mom figured out on her own due to increasing pain.

The pain, the nausea, the hair loss, the fatigue... it would be worth it if the treatment plan was working, yanno? But it isn't. My mom and I cried for a bit, talked about it, and decided to go full steam ahead into the next game plan. Her chemo has been switched and I can only cross my fingers and hope it works.

She hasn't been working and she feels guilty. She tells me all the time how useless she is around the house. I tell her she isn't, her only job is to focus on herself and to get better. She's the best person I know and if she could do more, I know she would. She misses her friends from work and having a routine. Work is the one place that keeps me sane and I can only imagine how much I would miss it if I couldn't do it anymore.

I had so much anger when I made my original post. It's still there, but the anger is directed towards the universe's indifference towards my mom. In the spirit of that indifference, I've accepted my role as a primary caregiver and I advocate for my mom wherever and whenever I can. If the universe won't help my mom, I sure as hell can.

There are very few things I'm thankful to my mom's cancer for, but in the spirit of looking on the bright side, here they are:

\- I've been learning how to cook. Nothing fancy, usually spaghetti or salads, but enough to make sure my mom and sister are well fed.

\- I've learned a lot from my mom. I'm now a pro at changing ostomy bags. It'll definitely help my healthcare career. (I'm staying the fuck away from oncology.)

\- My family dynamic has changed. We're all a little more put together. My family, her brothers and sisters, have been a blessing. They bring her breakfast and lunch from time to time while I'm at work or they clean around the house. My aunt even took my mom's laundry because I couldn't get to it. My uncle will come over and order pizza so I don't have to cook. My mom and I say I love you a lot more to each other. My sister has been seeing a therapist and she's become a lot more open with my mom and I.

\- I've taken my health seriously. I've been eating better whenever I can... little things like fruits instead of chips and less meat, more seafood or meat alternatives. I signed up for the gym (I've only gone a handful of times, but hey, I'm trying). I take daily vitamins. I know there's nothing I can do about genetics, but if I can try to reduce my risk, why shouldn't I?

Would I say these good things have been worth my mom's emotional and physical turmoil? Absolutely not, \*but\* it is the hand she and I were dealt with and we're making the best of it.

Whenever I need a good cry, I'll listen to Taylor Swift's ""Soon You'll Get Better."" I didn't realize the song was about her mom battling cancer until after I initially listened to it. There's one particular line that gets me every time and I know despite her millions of dollars, she's desperate, like us all, to make our loved ones better:

279,Being in denial and refusing help,5,eea5fy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/eea5fy/being_in_denial_and_refusing_help/,1,1577076813.0,"My dad was diagnosed two months ago with stage 4 metastatic lung cancer that has spread to his prostate and bones. He has refused to get chemo that would extend his life only another year or two. That is fine and I respect that decision. So his life expectancy is under a year. 

I can tell he is taking a turn, as he is now complaining of some diffuse pain, his cough is constant, and he has a slight wheeze. My dad has always been a busy body, and luckily I think that is helping him on a functional level, but my family that lives closer to him tell me he’s starting to go to bed a little earlier, or stay in bed a little longer. He’s getting more exhausted with doing some stuff around the house. He’s very small too, and is only around 120 pounds. He has little appetite and is looking more and more like “skin and bones”.

My dad is being very stubborn about seeking help. As someone who isn’t seeking treatment, I spoke to his oncology nurse navigator about what his options even are as his disease progresses. She said that at his last visit they did try to refer him to palliative care to get the supportive care he needs, but she said he refused.

Since learning that, I have tried to broach the subject and educate him on what palliative care could help with, but he still refuses. I think he sees it as giving in, or not being “tough”, or perhaps that it means things are getting close. I can’t get him to understand it. 

So my question is less about what to do to convince him, but more on what do I and the other family members do if he literally declines further and passes away? I am his healthcare proxy and I have no problem signing him up with hospice and palliative care if he loses the ability to decide for himself. But I’m terrified of what to do if he remains mentally sharp, goes “out fighting”, and passes in his sleep at home. 

He has not planned for anything and he won’t. I have told him I can help with those things, but he’s in such deep denial that I don’t know what to do and I can’t force him. He’s not planning financially, he’s not planning for what happens after his death. He has told me he wishes to be cremated, but how do we even handle that if he passes with no plans? 

I know this is such a morbid post and question, but knowing my dad is going to do what he wants, I’m not sure what I do if I get a call that he’s gone. Who do I call? Who would come pick him up? With his recent turn and looking more sickly, I am worried that this is going to all happen in the next couple months. This is awful, I am sad he’s being overly stoic about it, I am sad he’s refusing to address his symptoms, but if that’s what he wants, then I want to plan for his “rebellious” departure from this earth.",2019-12-23 04:53:33

She lost a lot of time (memory wise) and her birthday so we celebrated her birthday again in addition to mine last month.  She’s been eating for three weeks since chemo mouth, nausea, and thrush (four times). 

As of three weeks ago she’s mentally here and remembers things finally. I had to give her animal facts so I could tell if she was becoming impaired... low sodium and low red bloods cells made her strange. 

We’re trying to stay positive, cry when needed, and take it one day at a time.

She’s a nurse though so some days are easier than others. She’s really weak, so we don’t know how to keep her from being bored that she can do. She’s the go and do type. Her fine motor skills aren’t good.

She was forced to experience a lot of ups and downs with her treatments leaking, her constant fevers, and her picklines causing constant problems. 

However, starting this past September I noticed she began to act differently. She became more confused and would start yelling at my father and i that she hated us for mundane things. I've since gotten used to it, but she's becoming more and more confused and delusional by the day. Im just curious if all this delusion will disappear with timea after her chemo and how care takers are able to handle the yelling and the crying everyday without breaking down?

After an ultrasound and CT scan, we find out that the cancer has metastasized and a tumor has started to grow on his adrenal gland. There is also a calcified spot in his lung.

According to the information the doctor is working on, he has 10% - 20% chance of living past 5 years and the data is only relevant to folks much older than him. We have gotten referrals to larger centers with oncology teams that may be running trials. 

I'm remaining hopeful. I'm doing my best to not let far off thoughts or emotions get the best of me but also wondering if there is a better way to manage this. We have so many plans for the future and now it all feels shaky.

She’s doing ok, her doctors think she’s only going to need one series of chemo to take care of it, but she’s nearing the end of the process and she’s really, like really struggling to eat and drink.
She can only keep down about 1 sip of water every couple hours. Which isn’t nearly enough to keep her fluids up as you might imagine, and she can’t handle anything above or below room temp.

She’s basically been living off about 1/2 an ensure and a glass of water a day, and she’s really trying to eat more stuff like applesauce or jello or pudding, but obviously she can’t keep a whole lot down and throwing up would bring us back to square one.
She’s also getting a lot of mouth sores and irritation from vomiting and from the chemo, so it’s really painful to swallow.
Her biggest fear is going on a feeding tube, before her sister had died she needed a feeding tube and it really scared her, she has enough trouble with her stoma bag already. 
I’m not a medical professional, I don’t have any experience as a caregiver and my job basically is just to do what I can to keep her spirits up, encourage her to eat and drink, and make sure she takes her medication.

Marijuana would be an option, but Missouri (where we live) has no regulated dispensaries yet, and won’t probably til late 2020, which obviously doesn’t help us.

She did not have health insurance and avoided talking to a doctor for a long time until the pain got to be too bad and I called my aunt and convinced her to drive her to the emergency room.

I was 19 at the time and looking into colleges, but my grandparents raised me and I instead opted to become my grandmother's caretaker.  Her condition has gotten better and worse over the months.  Sometimes she seems fine and can do the things that make her happy like cooking and playing games with me and my cousins, and sometimes she is in too much pain to move or speak and has to be rushed to a hospital.  She is a very strong and funny and loving person and I have nothing but respect for her resilience and character, but my grandfather and uncle are not very sympathetic when she is at her low points, often accusing her of overreacting or pretending she is Feeling worse than she is for attention, and they will speak badly of her right in front of me or act frustrated with her to her face.

Those few years ago, the doctor gave her a five year estimate, but she has been at her lowest point yet lately and it feels like she has given up.  She can barely walk anymore, she has trouble sleeping for days on end and will babble incoherently to herself and others--and when she is coherent, all she talks about is dying, and it's breaking my heart because I still have my grandfather and uncle getting upset with her for being unable to take care of her hygiene alone or get around well, and they act convinced that she is faking it, and I feel like I have to do everything and that I am the only one who cares.  I think that maybe they are just in denial of the severity of the situation and reacting badly, but it just seems so meanspirited and makes me feel so alone because I put my life on hold to help.

Being a caretaker is hard and I feel bad for even admitting to having a hard time because I know that she is having a far harder time than me, but it's just so crushing to have to take care of someone who used to take care of you and knowing that no matter how hard you work or what you do, they will only get worse.

It has not been an easy road, especially because he still is dealing with the effects of his battle with stage II colon cancer from 2013-2015. I am able to have some “good” days; these days usually include me not breaking down about the current life situation I am in and I am able to have happiness with him on these days.

5 years ago my dad was diagnosed with stage IV  Squamous Cell on his tongue and throat. He was given 9 months to live. After chemo and radiation, we’re lucky he’s still with us. He was able to walk me and my sister down the aisle and meet his grandkids. Yay! 

Unfortunately in the past few years, my sister and I had a falling out and my mom and I don’t talk as much. My sister and I have started to rebuild our relationship and have always said no matter what happens between us, we need to put it aside to be there for our parents. I love my mom dearly and have a decent relationship with her. I’m definitely closer with my dad and my mom is closer with my mom. 

During my dads first treatment, chemo, my sister and I took on a lot of the caregiving. My mom seemed to be in denial, didn’t seem too interested in the day to day care. It was hard to watch my dad not get the support he needed from his wife. At that time, my mom was still smoking and refused to smoke outside and saw no issues with how it would impact my dad’s recovery. That kept up for 2 years. 

A few weeks after chemo ended, my sister and I had our falling out. (My husband and I took my family on vacation and my brother in law, sister’s husband, got drunk, hit on me and pushed me against a wall when I refused, all in front of my sister! In the morning I told her I thought it was best if he left, but wanted her to stay and have time with my dad. She said no, he’s staying. After that they both started drinking again. I asked them to leave the next day.) I know it upset my parents, but they said they understood. Plus, they’ve never been huge fans of her husband. 

After that, my dad started radiation on his throat. Because of the family drama, the toxic work environment I was in and my own mental health, It was hard for me to be there for my dad as much I was had been. My mom did a 180 from being kind of passive to controlling all aspects of his care. Which was good because he needed a peg tube and supervision with his pain meds. She wouldn’t accept any help from us, extended family or friends. Once my dad recovered from radiation and was tumor free, things relaxed a bit.

My sister had her 1st child and we all kind of came together again. I eventually resigned from the toxic job (that was really tough) and became very depressed. I’m glad to say that battle is over and I’m taking good care of myself now. 

This past October we learned my dad’s cancer returned in his lung and started immunotherapy. His oncologist talked immunotherapy up as the miracle we were hoping for, telling us how well his patients have done on it. I think his optimism and calmness didn’t give us much reason to be concerned. 2 weeks ago we found out it wasn’t working. Dad started chemo yesterday. He’s always been in good spirits, had a good sense of humor about all this and says he’ll stop fighting. Yesterday while sitting with him, I saw a fear in his eyes I hadn’t before. Understandably. 

I’m concerned about the care and support my dad is receiving at home. My mom is now 71, still works part time from home and babysits my sister’s 2.5 year old and now her newborn son, for 30-40 hours/week. My dad had rearranged his work schedule to accommodate my mom needing help with just 1 grandchild. My sister is a lawyer that works out of her house.  I live less than a mile away (I’m job hunting so my schedule is flexible) and her in-laws live a street away from them. Seeing what a burden it is on my parents, I’ve offered to watch my niece and nephew countless times, but she prefers my mom watches them. When I talk to my mom, the only thing she’ll talk about is my niece and nephew. 

My dad felt (and now even more) that my sister was/is taking advantage of them. He finally told my mom he’s upset with my sister for expecting them to watch her kids full time, especially now that my he’s going through chemo. My mom said it’s not a problem and doesn’t understand why it matters. My sister and her husband have always been closer with his family and I know it hurts my parents that they don’t spend time with them outside of babysitting and especially on the holidays. My parents don’t even bother asking them with help them around the house, so the help they do need, falls to my husband and me. We’re happy to help, but it’s frustrating. 

My biggest concern is my dad receiving the care and attention he needs at home from my mom. I’m frustrated because I can’t  do anything about it. 

Sorry for the rant and to those that made it to the end, thank you.

At the time our children were 3 and 1 years old.  Now they are 4 and 3.  My wife has gone through month of chemo, surgeries and chemo pills.  On top of an already very difficult home life situation, I also have a full time job, mostly working from home.    


I've been struggling with how honest I am with clients about what is going on because I'm afraid they'll think I'm incapable of getting work done and won't want to work with me anymore. For the most part many people I work with/for know what's going on but I always say things like ""we're getting through it"" and ""there are some tough days here and there"".  In truth everyday is extremely difficult both physically and emotionally.  Every minute of my life is either taking care of my wife or kids, running errands or working.  I usually work very late hours in order to catch up and then I'm up bright and early to get the kids off to school.    


We do have paid help a couple of days a week and sometimes family and neighbors chip in so we are incredibly fortunate in that regard.  But even with help I'm still stretched thin and struggling every day.  


Lately I've had clients who have been very unforgiving to me.  I've done incredibly good work for them for years but I've been struggling meeting deadlines.  On top of everything I'm going through, it's terrible to have clients telling me I'm failing because I'm asking for an extra day here and there to get things done, or sometimes moving conference calls at the last second because I have to deal with family.  


Unfortunately I can't just tell them so screw off because I do need the money.  It's just such a terrible feeling to do everything you can to please everyone and on top of that be criticized and demeaned.  It's infuriating to get comments from people who have no idea what it's like to go through this.  ""Can't your family help?"", ""Can't you get a full time nanny?"" People seem to hate excuses no matter what it is.

&#x200B;

I just don't know how to handle these people and my work situation.  I'm a responsible guy getting treated like someone slacking off.  It's difficult enough to have two young kids, or to have a wife with cancer.  I have both and I'm trying my best here.

  
Has anyone had a similar experience?  


On one good note my wife's cancer has not spread so we do fully expect her to pull through but she has 12 more months of chemo pills. ",2019-03-09 22:40:46
298,May I please have some of your knowledge / experience to help my mom?,4,ag6774,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/ag6774/may_i_please_have_some_of_your_knowledge/,10,1547567661.0,"Dear Redditors,

As I am writing this request, my mom is right now getting radiotherapy through her skull to eradicate a cancer thing. I feel extremely worried. She has 3 children, and with 29 years I am the oldest. Perhaps not surprising I am the lead in her caretaking. 

I want to cook for her the coming weeks, but she needs to gain some weight also. I want her to feel happy and strong. Alive, healthy...

Just to protect her and myself I will say that I also post in The_Donald and many would consider me a neo-nazi. I don't want to go into that now but I have been banned from many subs just because of that. If your political stance is holistic for your personality, please ignore my question. Those who can separate the two I will be very grateful for.

Can you please advise me what I can cook for her, with extremely basic kitchen things, that is ultra healthy? Something with a high calorie density which is also nutricious :) I made her drink chaga mushroom tea for months before her treatment and she already improved drastically just from that. Is it okay for her (56 years old) to keep drinking it after her radiation therapy?

And I can't cook the same or similar things all the time, right? How can I vary? Which nutrients should I avoid for her and which one should I deploy rich? Money is not an issue.

Thank you so much, and warm regards,

My mother is dying slowly of bone cancer. The doctor said she was hospice ready....that was sweet talk really to my sister and i. We've been the major caregiver's to our mother.
She made us promise we wouldn't put her in a nursing home or have outside help come in. If we knew how bad and how fucking emotionaly draing this was going to be we would have never agreed to saying we would do it all.
It started out with her comming home from the nursing home after a surgery that paralyzed her leg..she was talking her normal self minus her ability to walk. So that meant she needed minimal assistance. 
Then she complained about horrible headaches. The doctor did a head C.T scan and found 3 meningioma tumors. He had told us it's a progressive thing to where we won't recognize our mother. I thought "" no it can't get that bad "" i was saddly mistaken. Those tumours have hijack our mother!!.
We have been riding the emotional roller coaster. One day she's okay the next she's bat shit crazy thinking were trying to kill her dog and her. She refuses to take her meds cause she thinks were trying to poison her. Thanksgiving was a shit show.
Ny husband and myself get up every morning to go get her ready for the day. But before we go the only thing we have left of our life is the gym. So as a result we have to get up at the ass crack of dawn after working a 12 hr shift my self and bang out an hour there. Where we really don't get a good work out in cause were looking things up on the phone as how to best take care of new things that pop up. The newest being we just discovered that her heel of her foot has rotted flesh. That happened with her out of control lymphedema where her legs swelled to the point of her legs weeping fluid. Looking like they were gonna explode. We were so busy chasing bed sores that we missed the heel of her foot decaying. Now the aweful guilt i feel cause in reality i'm not a fucking nurse. Nor do i want to be but i bet i could be now.
Thanksgiving we found her in her wheelchair at the edge of her seat getting ready to face plant. Thinking she could stand and just WALK!! Gotta talk to her like she's 2 years old. Try not to startle her. I say "" mama today is Thanksgiving were gonna have a great day "" i tell her we gotta get ready. It went from happy to "" get the fuck out of my house "" at the top of her lungs. She thought she wasn't going to get a shower. The night before my sister had given her one. She didn't belive me. She thought we had tricked her and left her out of the days festivities. Said she was gonna call the police on me. For what i don't know. I say "" fuck it, i'm done. I just can't. "" There's never a thank you. There's always a fight about something that she's made up in her head. I fleed the situation. My husband was able to talk her down. Everyday it's insane. Like a fucking dream of straight crazy.
Of course we have the siblings that don't even help. It's all so very disturbing. The whole care of our mother is on my sister and i and my husband. . Those other 6 siblings like to come sniffing around to see what if anything might be left to them
 Fuck their mother and us. We can just go on forever like this in their minds. They see our mother here and there and her deteration is obvious. I can see them coil in discussed. Not shocking to us who care for her every fucking day!! Whats shocking to us is how you all could care less about our mother and let us 2 girls do everything. 
She takes 15 mlgs of morphine plus 8-10 vikoden es plus 40 mlgs lasixs,eliquis,cipro and last but least the stool softener. She swears that its a mexican jumping bean. I can't tell her any diffrent or she looses her shit and kicks me out of her house. I wait ten min outdide in the freazing cold and go back in and its just like she just saw me. Like nothing ever happened.
She resisted the hospital bed cause she thought we were trying to put her to bed for the rest of her limted life. It was a nightmare trying to convince her to go to bed. She wanted to sleep in her chair wich lead to bed sores on her bum cheecks and the inside of her thighs. And she'd stay up for 3 days straight. No good rem sleep. Wich made her bat shit crazy. Wich leave my sister and i exausted. 
If we knew that her death was gonna draggggg onnnn and onnn we would have never agreed. It's fucking torture. We have my sister and i spent our life savings. Myself 17 grand. All my money i was saving to buy a house. Her care and comfort cost. Something the other 6 wont contribute too at all. But they want their share in the end. Christmas they all were sniffing around.  They all felt soo bad. Ok then fucking help!!! 
I fear her death is gonna drag on and on. Death is negative in itself but throw in three exausted care givers who promised to not get help its beyong. I'm so fucking over it. My mother is gone i accepted that a while back. Now i'm taking care of a verbally angry person. Who is dying. I never went to school for those kind of things  Bathing, dressing feeding a parent. Are we supposed to see our parents so vulnerable and out of control? Is this gonna change how i see my mother.  I have to get out of this negative place. I feel swallowed whole. When she yells i feel lik a child who has pissed of their mother but then i gotta be the one who is firm take control of situations and force her to take her meds, force her to get dressed. Force her out of bed. It feels so wrong to forse my mother to do anything. I hate that i look like the asshole to my mother. She asks me every day "" what happend to me "" i tell her. And everytime she says "" no one told me i have cancer "" it kills me.
Then when i'm done with her and go to work for 12 hrs im stresed to death can't concentrate on my job. I make tons of mistakes. I'm literally atanding sleeping. As soon as my body stops. I feel myself twitch like i just was gonna fall asleep. Doing now as i write this. I feel so guilty for feeling everything i feel. But I'M FUCKING OVER IT!!

306,How do I respond to my mom's mental state? And can anyone tell me what the future holds?,6,9q93lw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/9q93lw/how_do_i_respond_to_my_moms_mental_state_and_can/,3,1540200210.0,"Fair warning, this will probably get longer than I planned. TLDR at the bottom.  


About three months ago my mom ended up in the hospital and was diagnosed with Small Cell Lung cancer. At that time, it was about a 6cm mass in her left lung, was wrapped around her bronchial tube and is in her esophagus and liver. There was a large, inconclusive area in her lower back that may be scar tissue. Her prognosis, with treatment is 12-18months.   


She completed 10 round of radiation and three weeks after that (though she should have gone in immediately after, based on her symptoms) she went into the hospital and spent three weeks trying to get her blood counts back to an even remotely safe level. During those three weeks, she was given her first round of chemotherapy which helped to keep those counts dangerously low (Her platelets were at .13 at one point and the best they ever got to was 27 when ""normal"" is 140-440). She got sepsis while there and so she was given intense antibiotics and (not related to the sepsis) had to be catheterized. She was released from the hospital with the catheter one week ago.   


Her physical health seems to be stable but that last week in the hospital and since then, her mental health seems to have plummeted. She has withdrawn even more than usual, and she is one to isolate herself on a great day, and is lost now that she is no longer able to work. Her identity was in that job and now that she is unable to work, she feels as if her life has no purpose. She says she just sits all day with nothing to do but will not respond to any of the many, many offers and suggestions that have come her way to get her out or to pass the time. It's like everything goes in one ear and out the other.   


Through all of this, I have been her main caregiver and support. During her hospital stay, I was there all but two of the days and on those ""off days"" I was in contact with her nurse, a doctor and my mother. Since coming home, I have pulled back a bit but am in contact with her daily and have been taking her to appointments and such. She says she wants me there but when I come, all she does is repeat the same complaints. For the last two weeks, I've tried to offer suggestions/solutions, just listened and held her while she cried, just sat silently to be there with her and even tried being more ""stern"" with a ""snap out of it"" sort of approach. Nothing I say or do, don't say, don't do, seems to matter at all.   


I believe she has had depression most of her life, at least since my early high school years. Life has been very hard on her, but her response to all of it seemed more depressive than stressed and this really seems to be the case now. I realize that I do NOT understand what it's like to face death and carry the weight of all of what comes with that, but it's so hard to see her not even try to pick herself up. While she's always been focused on herself this has caused her to really go down that hole. She's never been one to be overly interested in the lives of others, my life or my kids but now, I'll be with her for 4-5 hours and she won't even ask about them or how I'm doing. She doesn't even want to look out the window and discuss the weather. It's just a repeat of the same complaints from the day before.   


All of this to say:  
1- I'm frustrated. I will never say this to her and I feel like a complete jerk for even thinking it but it's true. I feel like a total a hole for being relieved when I took a day ""off."" I can't imagine what her life is and I feel so guilty for being selfish myself and letting her depression be annoying--even typing that--ugh. I'm hoping that pulling back, just a bit, and refocusing myself will help refuel me, so to speak, so that I can be 100% for her.   


2-Has anyone else dealt with a loved one with small cell? I know every person and every case is different but I want some sort of mental picture for the future. The cases I've found online tend to be from survivors who started with a different diagnoses or prognosis, and while that's wonderful, I know my mom's chances of actually beating this are slim to none. I'm a planner and I like to have some idea, no matter how much it can change, of what lies ahead. What should I watch for? What is this going to be like? This grey area between now and when/if she dies is hard for me and I realize that's my own issue and something I just have to accept--that it will be grey until it's not--but any type of experiences or advice would be so appreciated.   


**TLDR:** My mom has small cell lung cancer and is (in my opinion) very depressed and unwilling to do anything to even attempt to change that. How do I deal with those emotions and what can I expect for her physical health and my responsibilities as her illness progresses?

Dear Mr. Mauldin, Mr. Darrow, and Ms. Popp-Hellebuyck

My name is Heather Ross and my husband is Lt. Colonel Gary Ross. We are an active duty military family temporarily staying at the Residence Inn in Denver while my husband receives cancer treatment at the Colorado Blood Cancer Institute. When we got here and met with the Oncologist he said that we would be here for a minimum of 6 months or longer; pending the outcome of his chemo treatment. So naturally we wanted to get Gary a comfortable La-Z-Boy recliner to provide comfort to him while he recovers from his surgery and upcoming treatments. When we arrived at your store #216 (with our service dog Lucy in tow) we met your associate, Kate and she knew exactly what we wanted. The prices were so good, we ended up purchasing TWO of your recliners!

We explained to Kate that Gary would be having surgery early Wednesday morning (Sept 5th) and that’s why we would like to have the chairs in place prior to that procedure. She said she couldn’t make any promises but would see what she could do.

Tuesday afternoon Kate called and said that due to the Labor Day holiday she couldn’t get a driver to deliver until Wednesday. We explained that we wouldn’t be home all day on Wednesday because of Gary’s surgery but that evening would be okay. She asked if she could call us back after looking at the schedule. We said absolutely and then never heard back from her.

We were sitting in our hotel room having dinner when there was a knock at the door. There standing with recliner #1 was Kate. She had a huge smile on her face and she said that she was delivering our two recliners. We stood there in shock as she rolled the recliner right into the room, put it all together and explained how it worked. My husband is very limited in moving items but we offered to help and she said absolutely not. She went downstairs and in a few minutes she was back at the door with recliner #2.

Again, she rolled it right in and set it up for us. I couldn’t fully express my gratitude because I didn’t want to start “ugly” crying. Cause let’s be honest, once the “ugly” cry happens it’s a hot mess for a solid two hours.

We were floored by Kate’s KINDNESS and her amazing CUSTOMER SERVICE. Amazing customer service and kindness are not often highlighted or appreciated as it should be. In a world of constant bickering and people being mean, when we have something GOOD happen it NEEDS to be celebrated and acknowledged. So please know as a caregiver, Kate is truly a hero and as a military spouse I don’t use that word lightly.

Thank you Kate and La-Z-Boy for allowing my husband the opportunity to come home from surgery and relax comfortably. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for making this incredibly difficult time a lot less stressful.

Customers for life and HUGE fans of Kate! 🙂

Really wish I wasn’t here... but I’ve been reading on this sub for a few months, and this is my first post here. My dad has been diagnosed with stage 3 pancreatic cancer. He has only undergone two chemo treatments so far, with four more to go. 

Right now, he is still pretty functional, although he obviously gets tired a lot. I used to live six hours away. Earlier this year, I moved to a town about an hour away from him. I go to every appointment with him, and I am his medical power of attorney. He lives alone. My mother died ten years ago from liver disease. Fortunately, I work remotely, so being there for him when he needs me is not a problem. 

We have talked about the fact that me and my spouse will probably need to move in with him at some point. He is happy with that arrangement, and so am I. But I want to give him as much autonomy as I can until living with him becomes a necessity. 

I understand that no two situations are the same, so the answer will be different for everyone. But in your experience, how can you know when it’s time to move in and presume the role of caregiver? Are there specific things I should be looking for, or specific questions I should ask his oncology team? I would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks in advance. ",2018-08-11 05:06:29

I am 21, my fiancé-to-be (24) has a nonseminomas retroperitoneal  germ cell tumor at stage IIIB.  His tumor was the size of a cantaloupe before treatment, pressing on tons of nerves, and they originally thought it was starting to wrap around his aorta (it wasn't thankfully).
The month he was diagnosed I was about to sign a lease to an apartment and he was about to make a 630 mile move to live with me. I live in Pennsylvania but have spent a little over a year in North Carolina being the sole caregiver to my partner outside of of the occasional ride to the hospital from his father.
He was misdiagnosed for around five months and the doctors told us that had he not started the treatment when he did he would have been dead within a month- the cancer was very close to spreading to his lungs and brain. I still don’t understand how they know that and have been to terrified to ask and worry about the “what ifs” for his cancer.
After four five day cycles of cisplatin and etoposide over four months he was scheduled for a Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in February of this year. His team told me to go homes, and start planning our lives together, the hard part was over, he was stable.
I started college and took a week off to go and be with him the week of surgery.
His tumor markers skyrocketed in between this last round of chemo and the surgery... So I went on medical leave and again became his sole caregiver.
Three rounds of carboplatin and etoposide each round followed by autologous stem cell transplants. As of two days ago he had his RPLND surgery and they were able to remove the whole tumor without needing to do valve replacement or reroute anything like his team had anticipated needing to do. The tumor was the size of a baseball after all the treatment according to his surgeon. They were able to remove all the lymph nodes and entire tumor.
We get the pathology report back in a week to start figuring out the next steps.
Today was the first day in well over a year he was in unbearable pain in his back and abdomen and he was able to get up and move to the chair, is hungry, and drinking all things vital to his recovery. I am ecstatic for him, how well he did and he's not as terrified now. His father tried to tell him he was cancer free now but I corrected him. The tumor his gone but the doctors have Not told him or even mentioned him being cancer free at this point in time... He told me he wants to move and just pretend all of this was just a horrible dream which would be nice! I am working with his team to coordinate with a transplant center where I live so he can get his shots, labs, scans, and other appointments he needs without having to travel back and forth every few months.
The tumor may be gone and his pain is much better but everything in me is still bracing for the next thing and every older adult I have spoken to told me that likely will not fade until he hits the five year mark. I am exhausted. I love this man more than anything in the world and dropped out of my life twice to do everything in my power to help him through this but I am SO TIRED. Tired and sad and angry at everything even though it was nobody's fault. Sorry for the extremely long post its been a long year.",2018-07-29 13:28:04

The dr last week was very optimistic that once the tumor is out he will be totally fine, maybe need some radiation but not super likely. 

Here’s the horrible part. I have caught myself thinking that if it were more serious and he didn’t make it.. I wouldn’t hate that. I can’t even type that without having to pause and think about deleting it because it’s awful. I feel like the worst spouse ever for thinking that, and I’m hoping that maybe it’s just stress and anger and anxiety catching up with me because I am not facing and dealing with my emotions.

This was right after my bf’s senior year of college. 

He is the smartest, kindest, most motivated person I know and is currently working on his PhD. I add this for two reasons. First is that he would do anything he could to help anyone, especially the people he loves. Second, he is trying to be a professor and going to a top ranked school, even out of state, was important for what he wants to do with the rest of his life.

He has a really hard time with the loss of his mom. I think the extended period of dealing with feeling like she was getting better and then having to make peace with her passing over and over made everything so much worse in the healing process for him. 

I know that his mom supported him going to college to continue pursuing his future. She would have hated holding him back. Especially with all the uncertainty with her condition. 

He feels so guilty that he didn’t stay home or at least closer to home to help his mom. He sister went to school closer to home and I know that makes him feel worse.

MRI revealed a spine COVERED with deposits. Her time is now reduced to weeks, and hospice is involved. They're truly wonderful people, for anyone who is wondering. My brother is staying here with us full time, and his wife comes over daily. Basically a non stop stream of visitors which is good to keep her distracted. 

Honestly, I hope, when it happens, that she just falls asleep. Please, no seizures, no coma, nothing too painful. Just sleep.

January 30, didn't know my 54 year old mom has cancer. Definitely had some health problems, but after a lifetime of poor choices that's to be expected.

January 31, find out she has a large, stage IV, malignant adenocarcinoma in her right lung that has metastasized to her spinal fluid and meninges. I didn't even know leptomeningeal carcinoma was a thing. Super rare, aggressive, terminal. What the everlasting fuck.

I quit my career and moved from a place, man, and life that I love back to a place I moved away from for a reason to stay with her. No one asked me to, but neither did anyone tell me not to in any way, shape, or form.

This shit sucks. In just over a month she has lost almost all control of her legs. She has a facial palsy and food tastes different. Her ribs are now alternating between excruciating pain and tingling numbness. She has lost 20 lbs and hardly puts effort into eating, drinking, or moving regularly even though she knows those things will help. She hollers in pain most mornings until the pain meds kick in and she can get comfortable.

I want to help her. I want her to maintain her dignity and independence for what little time remains to her. But this is fucking hard. I listen to her holler but can't help. I've had to carry her and scoop her up off of the floor twice now. I'm constantly pushing food and liquids and meds, but usually I'm just ignored. 

AND I MISS MY FUCKING LIFE.

I'm watching my mom die. And it sucks. And I think I need more help with this, but my brother never has time because kids and her friends are unreliable and, to be honest, I'm terrible at asking for help.

That is all.",2018-03-04 00:55:50

I hated comforting him while he struggled to catch his breath first thing in the morning, I hated writing everything down in his note book for what time he took the medicine and what medicine he took. Now he's gone it's not so much sadness, he had a hard ten months and in the end it was for the best. 

All those things I hated doing I now greatly miss, as horrible as all those tasks where it's suddenly strange I no longer have to do them. For the last few months I couldn't leave the house because he had a panic attack, and now I can leave the house I don't want to. ",2017-09-09 05:27:45

321,Just need to share,6,6ac0p6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/6ac0p6/just_need_to_share/,2,1494442133.0,"My mom was diagnosed with Stage III C ovarian cancer March 2015. Here we are in May and she is now in hospice care, about to be in a nursing home. When her oxygen arrived from the hospice this past Sunday, it seemed like everything sped up. Yesterday (Tuesday) she could barely speak, she can't move, can't eat due to slowed digestion, and can't really take medicines due to throwing everything up. 

The hospice is at home care my mom had set up without me. The nurse visits twice a week, which is not enough. I don't know what I'm doing! Ive been trying to get her in a nursing home since Sunday, but the social worker didn't visit till Tuesday, and he says he would try to move her that day, but 6pm rolled around and I didn't hear anything. We're waiting on the admissions person at the nursing home now.

My mom hasn't eaten in about 2 days. Even if she got something in she would throw it up. She is constantly nauseous. The medicine they gave us for nausea causes constipation, but it's one of the only ones she can take. She is in pain, but the morphine drops they gave us hardly do anything. Again, she can't swallow much without throwing up, they cause constipation, they last 2 hrs max, and so she is constantly in pain. She has ascites, which is a fluid that builds up in her body all the time that she has to drain. She does that herself, but it takes up a lot of her energy. I had been taking care of her by myself for 3 days, and I finally got my sister here to help. 

Scariest moment of my life happened today. My mom could no longer walk to the bathroom just due to lack of oxygen (even with the machine) so while waiting on a bed pan to arrive from hospice, we had to roll her using a chair to the bathroom. She had to go, and we had no other choice. We got her in the chair, and she just can't control her head or body. We start to roll her and her eyes just glazed over. She wasn't responsive to our calls. Her arms and legs were shaking. She finally spoke and asked a question that didn't make sense, like she was disoriented. She pointed the wrong way and asked why don't we go that way? We tried to ask why mom? She still had to go and seemed back to us, so we made it to the bathroom. She complained her head wasn't supported in the chair so once we got her back in the chair I stood behind her holding her up. 

I'm so scared what I will face tomorrow, and I don't know how much more I can take. I can't sleep and I just want medical help. I don't want her to be in pain anymore. I don't know what I expected, but this is my worst nightmare. 

I needed to rant and I'm so sorry for what you all may be going through too. ",2017-05-10 18:48:53

We are also talking with a second oncologist who will be performing a stem cell harvest in case we have a reoccurrence in the next two years. We saw oncologist #2 today and after looking at the scan report we both got the impression that her remission isn't as far along as we hoped. 

This along with me worrying about affordable pre-existing condition coverage is weighing on me.

I've never felt so tired and run down in my life. She's hospitalized in the city I work in, but it's 30 miles from home. So I stop in every night and stay for hours. 

I posted about this all earlier but to recap, she was told she had cancer in her spinal fluid. They put a reservoir in to do chemo with. She had issues with that and had to have it taken out. They said she tested positive for an infection in the spinal fluid. They inserted a drain and monitored her CSF for the last 2 weeks. She only tested positive for an infection once, and now the lab is saying they see no cancer cells either. So WTF indeed. 

My dad has stopped his life and work to be here basically as often as he can. We did a gofundme for my him because people wanted to donate but we didn't want to hassle with gathering the money. It was outrageous how generous people are. 

We thought we were going to lose her. It was the hardest few days of my life.

She loves seeing him but tonight she broke down because she was too tired to change his diaper and put his pjs on. Something she sees as such an easy task. 

My sister doesn't understand that mom won't say no to her. So she thinks if she doesn't say no then mom is fine with it. My mom has NEVER been able to say no to my sister. I just wish she would understand that this isn't something she can handle and she needs to just stop asking. 

And why doesn't her mother in law get asked?! She's not fighting cancer. She's healthy!

On Monday she didn't even bother calling her Onc, she just showed up at his office. They got her fluids but he never saw her. Just infused her for 8 hours.

I hope the holiday season passed with little to no issues for you all. I was fortunate to be home the week between Christmas and New Years and was able to help my mom out a lot. Her WBC was dangerously low and so we had to go 30+ miles each way for 5 days to get Neupogen injections. Annoying, but she felt so much better after the 5th one, it was worth it.

She's feeling cruddy again now, but she is supposed to be calling her Onc and making sure they don't want to see her prior to her next chemo on Thursday.

I had a moment at her last treatment. I was able to take her and we were there ALL day. Literally 8am to 5pm. She does 2 hours of fluids, followed by 2 chemos (Cisplatin and another one I can't think of), followed by another 2 hours of fluids. We get there at 8am to get blood work and she never starts her chemo until around 11 or 12. It's very frustrating to have to sit around all morning waiting. 

The chemo room was extremely packed. As in there wasn't an empty seat in the place. That was very sad to me. MOST of the people seeking treatment were elderly, but I always cringed when I saw the younger ones. Cancer sucks for ANYONE but to see someone around my own age (33) there just broke my heart.

Around 1pm, when I got back from a lunch run (mom has had a great appetite this time around, woohoo!) I had my moment. You see, my aunt was recently diagnosed with Stage IV liver/colon cancer (no one seems to know which was primary) for the first time. It's not a good prognosis. When I got back, she and my other aunt (who had throat/tongue cancer) were waiting to be called back. They came back with me...and it was just very surreal. 1. my mom was being treated. 2. my aunt sat in one of the chemo chairs for the first time. 3. my other aunt who lost a portion of her jaw and over half of her tongue was there. All 3 of these ladies have or are fighting cancer...and only 2 of them are blood related. It was just gut-wrenching to be honest.

But...if anyone can get through this, it's these strong ladies. They are determined to live, even if that means putting their bodies through hell.

I think we can all agree cancer is a vile disease that has taken the lives of too many lovely people out there...
My name is Hailee and I’m a cancer survivor. March 16, 2021 will mark one decade of remission for me, and I thank the stars every day. 
I’ve come here on recommendation of my boyfriend to tell you a bit about my story...
I was 14 when I was diagnosed with aggressive osteogenic sarcoma, and my life was flipped on its head.
Going through the hardest year of my life, I made a lot of deep realizations about myself and the Illness. I had started writing prose pieces that gave people some insight into my life as a teenage cancer patient, and little tricks I used to get by.
A few years after completing chemotherapy, my mother and I decided to combine our minds to bring a book to you, that we hope can touch the lives of someone in need of it.
You’ll find chapters from both patient and caretaker perspectives, with tips at the end of each segment. Tips for patients, caretakers, and friendly people who aren’t sure how to lend a hand.
I felt weird about making this post initially because I didn’t want it to seem like a huge “look at me” ordeal... I just kind of wish I had something like this when I was going through it . The only reason we made the book was to hopefully help a family who needs it like ours did, and if I don’t tell people it’s out there no one will know.
If you are interested in reading more about our story and how we tried to make the impossible possible every day, follow us on social media, or grab a copy for you or someone you care about! 
Thank you for you time and much love!

Sorry for the long rant - I'm at my wit's end and would love some advice.  My mother (72) has stage four Glioblastoma, diagnosed just over a month ago and we are 2 weeks into radiation/chemotherapy treatment.  Myself and 2 other family members are taking care of her.  Her tumor is inoperable, deep in the posterior corpus callosum.  Her initial symptoms were confusion and weakness.  After being put on steroids at diagnosis, she became manic - talking 24/7, insomnia, grandiose thoughts, etc.  It is unbearable.  

Over the last month (and after a 2nd hospital stay), steroids have been tapered down and things have gotten a little bit better (after trying 2 different types of sleeping pills and supplements).  She still talks constantly (but tells herself to shut up 8-) and exaggerates everything!  What's even worse now is that she has become aggressive, paranoid, and demanding.  She tells the doctors she is fine and can walk, sit, stand - no problem.  She tells them she doesn't sleep because we constantly wake her up to give her medicine, then tells them we constantly forget to give her medicine when needed.  When she is with us, she says she is weak, dizzy, and constantly needs our help.  I think she is faking and exaggerating, but is it real in her mind and how do I know?  Is it because of the tumor, the meds, the swelling, or just her being immature?  She talks about getting me fired from my job so I can spend more time with her!  She has meltdowns and throws things at us, screams, stomps her feet, shakes her head violently, etc.  She constantly hides things and says ""don't let them take my stuff"", wants me to block off her drive way, her street, thinks people are watching her, etc.  She throws a fit not to go to the bathroom when we tell her to but then will have an accident and say it is our fault for not taking her.

The doctors have not been much help on this front.  They don't want to give her more meds (I guess because of brain interaction) and only treat the cancer saying that should make it better, but she is driving us as crazy as she is.  I've thought about recording her with my phone when she does this so I can play it for the doctors next time.   We live in a mid sized town but went to MD Anderson for the first time this weekend for a 2nd opinion and I was hoping they might shed some light but they were more upset about the new sleeping pill because it might add to her confusion.  I would rather she be confused and sleep at night.  At least we (her caregivers) can remain sane that way.  Has anyone dealt with something similar?  We are so frustrated and don't know what to do.  Treatment is important but this is incurable and quality of life is important too!

Thanks so much!",2020-02-12 14:17:17

We have no other real family close by and my sister lives in Europe. So it’s just me. My mum took care of my dad despite being divorced and she is such a saint. I did my best but worked full time otherwise that would have been another burden on them.

My mum is my best friend and she went through a lot with my dad and we thought that she could visit her family overseas once my father passed but with the cancer she can’t.

She had everything removed and doctors are not worried and in her last blood test they found no cancer cells. She’s 71.

I’m getting married in November and having my first baby in January. She’s so excited and I’m so glad she is here. But I hate that she’s sick and can’t do things like she used to. Her blood pressure is up and down due to medication and she’s not well enough to visit my fiancé and I at our home, he would drive her here and back but that is even too much sometimes.

My dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer around four months ago. It's already methastasized to his bones and probably the lymphatic system, and it has been advancing at an increasing pace.

The biggest problem with him has been getting him to stick to his treatments. He was put on testosterone blockers to slow down the spreading, but last week he stopped taking them because in his mind those are for his prostate and wouldn't help if the cancer is already in other places. 

He was given a casein diet to help him gain weight. He got enough for a month. It's been a month and a half and most of it is still untouched. 

Even analgesics, and even if he's in pain. The doctor prescribed him a patch and two different pills (buprenorphine patches, oxycodone and pregabalin in pills). He read about the side effects and decided to take only the patch. Even now that the pain is being too much for the patch, he's still refusing to start the pills because ""he doesn't want to fill up his body with chemicals"". 

So... is there any stategy that has worked for you regarding this kind of thing? I have tried to reason with him, but it takes me nowhere.

My grandmother who I never met died of breast cancer in her early 60s, but she found it quite late and back then they didn’t have the same drugs and treatments. 

She said the lump is small, and doctors are taking her through the process quickly, and it will be removed o August 9th. She said they’re going to use radiation and some drugs that stop it coming back  (I can’t remember the name but I think it started with d or m). When she found out she told my aunt who got checked out, and they found the same thing but smaller, and also found that she didn’t have the gene for breast cancer so it shouldn’t be a genetic cancer.

I’ll try to briefly get out where I am. My aunt told us she had lung cancer last December. She said she wasn’t going to get treatment, and that she had only as long as she could hold out left. My sister and I immediately made a plan with my cousin (her daughter. And we are all the family left that counts) to come and stay. My sister and I live 14 hours away, and both have kids. We worked it out where she or I was here, along with my cousin. I was here for the month of May, but had to leave because my son was struggling without me. He came with me this time, so that I can be here all summer. 

I got here a bit over a week ago. Things changed a lot over the two month I was gone. She lost 40 lbs (50 as of today, she’s 94 lbs) and a lot of mobility. The first few days I was here she was perkier, trying to eat at least once a day, and more capable of holding a conversation. 3 days ago she was asking for more flavors of koolaid, which is basically all she drinks. 

Then she didn’t eat that night, and hasn’t since. She had been getting up about 3 times a day, for a few hours at a time. Lately she’s gotten up twice a day and only for 1-2 hours, then back to sleep. She’s in more pain. She’s been kinda loopy. It’s like each day she declines so much, it feels way too fast. 

I just don’t know what each day will be like now. My nerves are shot. I check on her like every half hour, worried I’m going to walk in and see she’s not breathing. (I may be overdramatic about it, but I have no way of knowing what to expect.) I have anxiety issues and insomnia, but I had been getting on a decent sleep schedule. 2 days ago she had some sort of seizure that left us calling hospice at 10pm. She was fine an hour later, and hadn’t had an issue since, but it was terrifying. I haven’t really slept since then. Maybe a couple hours a night. I wake up about every hour. It’s nerve wracking stuff. 

I guess I just needed to vent, and see what you all have to say. I am worried with her not eating we may only have days left. (According to the book they brought, not eating and sleeping more means weeks to days, and it’s been several changes in quick succession.) I know it’s coming, and I know we are making sure she’s at least offered everything she needs, though mostly it’s been just increasing amounts of meds. I just don’t know if I’m ready. I don’t know what I’ll do if tomorrow is the day she no longer gets out of bed, or can hold a conversation, or makes sense. Tonight she said several things that just didn’t mean anything, and it seems those come on more and more each day. (She does carry on conversations too, it’s hit or miss and depends on the meds I think.)

Understandably we are frustrated because he was out less than a week and he is in a different hospital in a different part of the province. Not to mention not even a straight awnser.

Haven't found out yet if the primary site is her gallbladder or bile duct. Not much of a difference there, one has a five-year survival rate of less than 5%, the other has a five-year survival rate of 2%. 

She has two living siblings, so do I, and my former step dad is the father of my younger brother. I also happen to be very close to my former step dad. My own father passed away a few years back, they have been divorced since I was a baby.

 My older sister lives on the other side of the country, and their relationship is frequently very contentious. my sister is mentally ill and has a personality disorder as well, and quite frankly she can't get along with anyone for very long and is frequently blowing up at my mother and me over the smallest things. To a much lesser extent, my mother has the same tendency.

My mother has been alone since her divorce more than 10 years ago. She neither makes, nor keeps friendships very easily because of how oversensitive and defensive she tends to be. She holds grudges for the smallest slight, but finds excuses to explain why no one in her office gets along with her. in a nutshell she has several tendencies of borderline personality disorder, but not enough of them to fit the diagnosis completely.

It's kind of a contradiction, but she's a nurse and she does it extremely well. She's very compassionate and kind with her patients and has often worked in a setting where she's cared for people in hospice.

I'm struggling right now because she has made it very clear that she doesn't want me to tell my older sister, or my ex step dad, or anyone else about her condition.

it's very early in the stages, and we still don't have an official prognosis yet. Hopefully in the next week or two she'll have an idea about the goals she can set, and if it's going to be a matter of months versus years. 

I respect her privacy because I wouldn't want anyone sharing this information before I had a chance to. I think a large part of this however, is because she knows she hasn't treated some people very well in the past, and doesn't want them to turn around and be smug or gloat to her. 

Years ago when I told her that my stepmother was quite ill and had advanced dementia, she turned away from me so that I wouldn't see her smugly laughing about it. She also said on numerous occasions she was going to live to 'piss on' my father's grave. 

I know she doesn't want my ex step dad to know about this because she was absolutely awful to him during the divorce and in the years that followed. she did everything possible to sabotage his relationship with my younger brother, and the distance between them persists to this day.

I want to respect her privacy because it really should be her news, but several of my family members from my father's side, as well as my stepdad, are a big part of my personal support system. I'm not really sure if anyone else has dealt with this but I am going to have my own emotional needs, and I want to be able to talk to more than just my husband or my counselor about this.

it's early yet, and at the moment I'm doing just fine, but I know this isn't going to always be the case.",2019-03-31 02:40:16

We’re a group of engineering students from Imperial College London looking to design an app to help voluntary caregivers. A few weeks ago, we posted on this sub to find out what were some of the main daily struggles caregivers faced. The most common was isolation and the struggle to cope with daily stress. 

So, to help relieve stress from caregivers, we’ve been designing an app called Feet Up, Meet Up, a digital space where caregivers can either meet up with fellow caregivers for fun events together, or simply find activities on their own in their downtime. We’ve made it optional to bring dependants along, so caregivers can either have a fun day out together with their dependant, or get some time alone for self-care.

Please check out a prototype of our app: https://marvelapp.com/546fc9b 
In this app, your dependant’s name is Jane, and you’re going out for coffee.

It’s just a prototype, so it’s not fully functional. But we’d like to get feedback on the main concept (suggestions of relaxing activities and meet ups), app flow, ease of use, layout and appearance.

Thank you very much for your time and any feedback.",2018-11-26 22:13:26

They have found fluid on her lung (the same side as the tumour) she is struggling to breathe, on oxygen sometimes.
They are unsure if it is pneumonia, or from the cancer. 
They are talking about draining the fluid, but she hasn’t been seen by the respiratory team yet.

She had 5 sessions of radiation on the tumor on her spine which has helped a lot with the back and sciatic pain, she had no reaction/side effects from the radiation. 
They are talking about doing chemo but she needs to be up and walking before they will start that. 

My partner is very much struggling with this, as am I, but I am more concerned for him.

How do we know what to look out for with this progressing? And how can we know if it is in the end stages or not?

My dad was diagnosed with tongue cancer 13 months ago, got surgery that removed 2/3 of his tongue and most of the lymph nodes on one side. Then a few months later started chemo & radiation, as the cancer was rather aggressive. He got a peg tube so he could get all the nutrients he needed. Except he wasn’t great at administering food & water so ended up in the hospital off and on for being dehydrated. 

Other than that, Things seemed all fine and normal for the most part for the rest of the year. 

About a month ago he had a follow up appointment and they found masses in his chest, right around his aortic valve so they do a surgical biopsy to verify if it’s cancerous. Of course it is. Why not. The healing process for that was very painful, as they had to cut in between his ribs.  That’s when the surgeon told me it was cancerous, and inoperable. 

About two weeks ago my dad called me at work saying he had been having trouble breathing and needed to go to the hospital, so I left work early and spent 8 hours in the hospital. The cancer had not only spread, it was restricting his lungs and they had to drain fluid from one lung. He stayed a little over a week. 

Now, after a flurry of doctor visits, we know he’s stage IV and has two options - palliative chemo or hospice. 

Is this real life? Is this weak person currently living with me really my father who has been my rock my entire life? Is he really not going to be able to meet any future children of mine and be able to dote on them? I’m too young for this, he should be healthy and we should be able to have a long time to go see Marvel movies and spend hours together nerding out together. 

I can’t help but think of his mom, who I’ve never known, as she died when I was 2. She is a stranger to me and it TERRIFIES me that that’s how my children will grow up, without my dad. 

These last 2 years have been absolute hell, I’ve been part caregiver for my grandparents (moms side) as my grandma has slowly gotten worse with dementia and my grandpa having too many health issues to count. This year is going to absolutely fucking suck and it’s so depressing to consider. They’re finally going to an assisted living facility tomorrow and I was so excited for them to have the care they need and we won’t have to worry about them as much and then BAM my dads dying.

(not including new patient visits) I worked very long hours trying to compensate but I guess I just needed a break. I have taken a few months off to explore some of my passions such as nutrition and travel. The courage to do this came from my patients- life is too short, they would say. Although, I'm not quite ready to go back, being away from the hospital and clinic, I miss my patients dearly! I know that being diagnosed with cancer can throw you for a loop and change your life upside-down. My question is for all of you going through cancer or family members or caregivers--- Do you feel you would benefit from discussing your case with an individual like myself over a 30 min to 1 hr long conversation where we could talk through the diagnosis and treatment and etc.? More from a scientific perspective and less of a support group. The purpose would be to add to the healthcare team- not take away from it. Your doctor would stay your doctor and I would just be an additional resource if nothing else then peace of mind that you are doing everything you can for the most favorable outcome. The purpose would be provide understanding of the disease and prognosis so that you are more prepared for your visits and at a better place mentally. Thank you for your time. Please do not hesitate to PM me if you have any questions or concerns. Wish you all and your loved ones the best. I have also posted on the other cancer group so sorry if there is duplication. thank you.",2018-02-03 03:58:06

To preface: My Fiancé has a non hodgkins lymphoma that is a Subtype of Diffuse Large B Cell called Primary Mediastinal B Cell Lymphoma. Diagnosed in august 2017 with a tumor the size of a softball pressing on his heart and Lung. 
We were all thinking his post chemo PET scan was going to be great. After 1 round of RCHOP Alec's tumor was decreased by 70%. After round 4 it was decreased by like 90% and was likely just scar tissue. PET after 6th round showed the original mass most likely dead (SUV of 2.2) and a new mass to the left of his heart the size of a cherry tomato (high activity and SUV of 9.9) 
Doc let us know he needs R-ICE and BEAM + SCT and that his chances have decreased by 30%. 
I feel like someone sucker punched me. I feel like there is a very real chance I will have to live without the love of my life. He means more to me than anyone. He is my best friend. We are so young and no one  understands and just says ""dont worry he will live and make it through this"" and I know they mean well but what if he doesn't?? I'm just supposed to live without the best person I have ever met??? this isnt fucking fair. I am so scared of what is to come. What if he gets an infection when his white count is low? What if he gets sepsis and dies? what if all this chemo fucks up his organs and he dies of something else? My mind is spinning and for the first time since this all started. I feel like I am going to lose him. I looked at him today and I tried to remember the exact way he looked in the sunlight in the car on the way home. Thinking to myself; I never know which moments with him are my last. Feeling pretty broken. Sorry for ranting.

Since July of 2015 I have been in an on-again and off-again relationship with my boyfriend. He was diagnosed with stage 2 lymphoma and when it went to stage 3 he ended our relationship. He went into remission a month after treatment, then was re-diagnosed with more cancer cells in different lymph nodes and went through treatment again. I have always been a supporter as we started off as friends and were freshly a new couple when his health started failing, and even when things were bad and we were ""broken up"" we had always had a non-labeled relationship where we acted like a couple even when we weren't officially a couple. In January of 2017 I moved to FL from CT to work on an internship for school. We briefly stopped talking for 3 months and then we started talking again in July and about a month later we started dating again. He was re-diagnosed with cancer, this time non-melanoma skin cancer that he got when his doctor's put him through an aggressive radiation treatment. He was optimistic about this form of cancer since to him it seemed a much easier battle to deal with than what he went through a year prior.

Well, in November when I came home to visit things seemed normal even as he waited for his treatment plan. About two weeks after my visit when I went back to Florida for the last six weeks of my internship, there was a shift in personality. We got into a huge fight because he was angry I went to a company holiday party. I thought he was being irrational and he would constantly be angry that I was never in my apartment (when you live with 5 other females do you blame me?) and would fly off the handle over minuscule things that never bothered him before. Come to find out, he had started taking chemo pills and they were making him ill. He was unable to hold any food down and was eating saltines and water in order to keep any nutrition in. He sounded emotionally defeated on the phone and he told me that he was avoiding his family so he also wanted to avoid me because he wanted to break up with me but he didn't want to make the mistakes he had made in the past, so he told me when I got home and he started getting better our relationship would start getting better.

I am home, and we haven't spoken in three weeks. I keep my distance but at the same time I am worried sick about him because on December 23rd he started his actual chemo on top of the pills. I know being involved with someone with cancer is putting your own feelings aside and just being supportive, but I feel so lost and confused as to how to be supportive when he doesn't want me or anyone in his life. I have a phobia he is going to die and I'll never know or get to say goodbye. My aunt died from kidney failure and complications from hemo-dialysis so I live with this fear that I will never be able to get that kind of closure. Is this normal behavior from someone enduring chemo? He refuses any kind of counseling or support network and even when I have mentioned side effects of treatment in the past he was very insecure and felt like he was ""gross"" for having cancer. My friends and family don't understand, they see it as he is being abusive because they don't understand the psychological toll cancer takes. Any form of advice would help, I feel so lost and don't know who to turn to.",2017-12-27 09:32:38

The results came back, and they said everything is probably okay but they want to do another test. Should we be worried?

I ran the results through Google Translate and it says ""The left temporal lobe patchy low density shadow of the brain parenchymal abnormalities. Third ventricle and fourth ventricle did not expand; narrowing and displacement of sulci, fissure, pool broadened and narrowed. Midline structure no shift."" 

I honestly have no idea what we're dealing with here? As I said, we're in China and I don't really speak the language. Most of my answers are coming from online since I can't really ask a doctor.

We've been fighting this since 2014, but it really kicked into high gear when we found out it metastasized in 2015. My dad and I both care for her, but I'm a college student so I have the most flexibility to take her to her appointments and help her with things. She's on a promising immunotherapy trial. She started having nausea in April, before the trial, but since beginning the trial, we think it's gotten worse. Now she's on marinol for nausea and when she can keep that down, it seems okay. Her issue is trying to keep it down to get it to work in the first place. For that, she has other medications, but she is becoming more confused and isn't taking them properly.

I live across the street, but I don't live with her, so I don't get to see everything she does and how consistently she takes her medications. She's told me that she's confused about how to take the medications, but she didn't want to call for clarification because she ""didn't want to disturb anyone's holiday."" Before that, it was the weekend. We have her doctor's phone number but she won't call it because she doesn't want to bother him at home. Her primary oncologist is now saying he wants to pull her off the trial early because the nausea is out of control, but she has told me she doesn't know if she's taking the medication right. She hasn't even told him all of what the study doctor has prescribed her, let alone that she hasn't been taking it like she should.

She is just constantly sick and I don't want to accuse her of not doing what she needs to do because she is very independent and has always been able to handle herself. But she isn't in the right frame of mind right now. She has lost 40 pounds in 3 months because she can't eat without getting sick. She's on THC pills that make her out of it. But she gets upset with me and tells me I'm being excitable when I tell her I want to call her doctor for her and clarify things. She doesn't want me to correct her or ask questions when she gets things wrong in appointments. I'm having to tiptoe around her to try to make sure she gets the care she needs.

I don't want her to get pulled out of this trial for nausea when we aren't doing absolutely everything the way we're supposed to. The doctors seem to think that the nausea and vomiting aren't responding to their treatments, but she isn't taking them as prescribed. Shes getting confused on dosing, forgetting doses or just throwing them up...

I am at a loss for what to do when my mom just won't let me step up and try to take some of this over for her. My dad isn't very organized when it comes to medical stuff and doesn't always take medications like he should either, and he's scared to tell her what to do. So I feel like I'm alone in this.

Long time lurker here. I'm my mother's primary caregiver. She was diagnosed with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer that had spread to her liver Sept 2016. By the time we finally got the diagnosis, the oncologist said she would have only had weeks without chemo. 

Flash forward to now. From everything I've read about this disease my Mom has done pretty well. She has been on a gemzar and abraxene regimen and us starting her 9th round this week. The biggest side effect she has had from chemo has been neuropathy. She isn't mobile anymore but at least we have the pain managed. 

Every 3 months she gets scanned and the first 2 showed shrinkage in the liver. The pancreatic tumor has never really shrunk but hasn't grown either. We just got her 3rd scan today and it shows that everything is at a stand still. Nothing grew. Nothing shrank. 

For now her Dr wants to keep her in the same chemo regimen and says that unless her neuropathy really takes over he doesn't feel the need to back off on any treatment. 

I don't know what I'm looking for here. I know no one can tell me what the clock reads on a ticking time bomb. I guess I'm just wondering, in your experiences, what happened after this stand still stage? Did it last very long? Did things start to go down hill? I know your experiences my not be relative to mine. I just feel like it would help me to know what to prepare for a little more.

The ER doctor wanted to send her home. She's fighting cancer, he said. She's going to have some weakness and issues related to that because of chemo (that she hasn't had in almost 2 month). 

She was thrashing about screaming in pain. They finally got her settled enough to sleep a bit but it wasn't long. They scheduled an MRI to see if any tumors had formed in her brain or on her spinal cord. She can't lay still for them. They attempted to sedate her this morning but lab results were poor so they cancelled. Will try tomorrow. 

Doctor came in and gave us good but bad news. She has an infection in her spinal fluid. This could easily be causing her symptoms and not a tumor that might have formed. They are still checking her for that. 

It's a long road ahead for her and us. She's never not known who I was, that was a hard pill to swallow. But I'm relieved that they have a possible reason for the sudden change in alertness.

Yesterday was supposed to be his first day back at work, but he's not feeling well and didn't end up going in until today. He's nauseous, and as of four days ago, has evidently developed neuropathy in his arms, which we thought we had gotten clear of since he wasn't actively in therapy any more. 

I've been back at work for five weeks now, and I came back to an absolute mess - severely reduced work force, everyone angry/grumpy/scared for their jobs, tons and tons of work undone because there wasn't enough staff, lots of people from outside the company yelling at me (till they got told off by someone else that I was out taking care of my husband who had cancer). 

In late June, I found out I was pregnant. In early July, we found out my husband had cancer, a week later I miscarried, three weeks after that he had major head/neck surgery, a month after that he started chemo. I held it together pretty well for a while, TBH - we moved close to the hospital for a month, away from our home, and I was coping OK if not great.

Over the last few weeks I feel like I'm coming unglued. I'm anxious and upset a lot, although I have long periods where I'm fine (like, a couple of weeks at a time). Last night I was up half the night convinced that he wasn't sick, but rather that his cancer had come back after only a few weeks and was destroying  his body. I'm dwelling on the thought of how I'm going to make it without him, how I'm going to raise our son alone, if I'll ever have any more children, etc. To cap it off, a close friend just got pregnant for a second time and when she found out I was upset (through my husband) she told me that I shouldn't make her pregnancy about me (which, yes, correct, but fucking harsh), and I honestly don't think I ever really got to process the miscarriage because so much else was going on. All I want to do is sleep. I go to work, I make food, I sleep, I make food, and I go back to work.

And now I get to watch her grow fat with another baby while I cant even try to have one with my husband, and while I'm not even sure if my husband will be alive to help me raise any other children. 

So what all this leads up to; did you find therapy helpful? I'm not resistant, exactly - it's just that I don't want to do anything but work and sleep and play with my little boy and husband. Therapy won't keep my husband's cancer from coming back and it won't bring back my baby.

I have since arrived in their country (Auckland, New Zealand) and am staying with his family whilst he's in the hospital. 
We're yet to get an official diagnosis/staging, but they're looking at osteosarcoma. It's in his left hip. 

He was due to fly to my country (Brisbane, Australia) this weekend to move in with me and start our independent adult lives, but obviously plans have changed. 

Has anyone else made a big life decisions in the spur of the moment?   I mean we were prepared to move in together, but not like this. I don't know how I feel about moving into his family's place with his parents and younger siblings. I like having my own space, but the time we will be over there for is indeterminate and it makes more sense monetary wise to live with them.

412,New Subreddit for Cancer Survivors and Loved Ones. We'd love to meet you!,4,4xbzim,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/4xbzim/new_subreddit_for_cancer_survivors_and_loved_ones/,0,1471007810.0,"Hi CancerCaregivers,

I just wanted to let you know that I just started a new sub for cancer survivors and their loved ones recently. 

Our definition of a cancer survivor is just someone who has been diagnosed with cancer at some point. So people who are in-treatment and post-treatment are welcome. If you are a caregiver, or you have someone in your life who has been diagnosed with cancer and you'd like some insight as to what they might be going through, please feel free to stop by and post a question or comment. My goal for this sub is for it to be a place where cancer survivors and their loved ones to support each other, find resources, ask questions, and get answers about all this craziness. 

Lets all support each other through, and after a cancer diagnosis. Hopefully we can help each other along this journey, and make it a little easier for everyone. I just want everyone to know that they aren't alone in this, and that there are other people out there who want to reach out to you, and support you, and who understand what you're going through because they've been there themselves.  

Please feel free to stop by, even if it's just to read the discussion. We'd love to have you. 

And a big thank you to TeacherTish for allowing me to post on your sub! You're awesome, and I'm really glad that you made a sub so that other caregivers have a place to connect to one another.

However, it is because he doesn't have enough growth and this was the first doctor to sound truly positive about his current situation and treatment plan.  She said, ""I probably don't need to see you in here for years!"" 

THEN we got a call from the Social worker at our hospital saying that we had 4 tickets to the Bruce Springsteen concert if we wanted them, so we rushed back from the city, wrangled up my dad and his friend and had an awesome night with ""The Boss"".  A huge thanks to upBeat Cancer for the donation and memories.  I even took video of us singing/dancing to ""Dancing in the Dark"" like a couple of dorks.

I'm so excited for her wedding, but as I sit here trying to write my speech for the reception I can't help but remember the last time I was MoH for my friend who has since died. I know the wedding will be an emotional time for me and the bride (as mine was) because we will he missing Lindsey.

I'm having an extra hard time, though, because my husband is so anxious about the wedding and our trip to visit family out of state after. He just started new meds and they're doubling the dose right before we go.  He's had some fatigue and thinks he's going to be tired.  Plus he's going to have to take this pill at the wedding because he has to take it at the same time each day. 
I know it's selfish, but I'm worried he's going to ruin the vacation. Last time we tried to go away for a mini-honeymoon weekend and his anxiety was so bad we barely left the hotel (and not in the good way lol).  I need some rest and relaxation and I want some fun time with him before I start back up with work in the fall and before his medical stuff gets more complicated  (he needs eye surgery and may be starting a trial). 

But there's no way for me to tell him this. I can't tell him to just suck it up for a week because cancer isn't going away. His medication isn't going away. And I'll just be a horrible person for making it about me.  So instead I'm going to rant on here and cry a little more and then put a smile on my face and hope we have fun.",2015-07-30 10:41:21

She has stomach cancer and the full tumor can't be removed, only some of it, and it's growing.

My grandma passed away from colon cancer several years ago. I saw my mom do anything, everything, and sacrifice everything for my grandma. So I know some of what to expect, but, I also don't know what to expect. 

This girl is so amazing and I want to be by her side and fight this with her. I've told her and have been honest with her that I'm committed to her and that I want to be with her. I'm not going anywhere. I know that she is scared, nervous, and frightened. I don't believe she has a huge support system in this fight though. I think she is afraid that I'm just going to leave her. She has very. strong feelings for me as well. 

So all in all what I'm trying to say is that I'm going to be a caregiver to a beautiful girl and that I hope we find a cure! Strides are being made everyday! We need to be there for the ones we love. Is it going to be hard? Yes. But we need to be strong for our loved ones and give them the support they need! Cancer sucks and F*** cancer! ",2015-07-19 14:47:09
416,Husband having major surgery on July 14th,3,3biwow,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/3biwow/husband_having_major_surgery_on_july_14th/,8,1435624136.0,"My SO and I married on June 18th (11 days ago) in front of a judge in a courtroom in a small town. We've been together for nearly 4 years; living together for 2 years August. 

He was diagnosed with Stage 3A colon cancer in July 2013. He nearly died in the process. 9 days obstructed. 13 days in the hospital. Life saving resection surgery late in the night with only me there. 5 feet of large intestine removed. (No colostomy bag though!) Large tumor removed. 21 lymph nodes removed - 2 were cancerous. 

All at 40 years old. 

After, I moved in to his home with my daughters. He went through 7 months of intensive chemo. Finally in April 2014 he was considered 'cancer free'. 

He got back to work, back to golf, back to 'normal life'. We managed to return to a 'normal' sexual relationship - about once a week. 

By this January he was in considerable pain most of the time. He wasn't particularly honest or forthright in telling me that the cyst on his testicle was MUCH larger. 

During his quarterly oncologist appointment, his CEA blood test was creeping up. 

By March, they get CT scan and PET scan scheduled. Something suspicious on CT accelerates PET to immediate. 
Lymph node on PET is showing up bright yellow - like a Christmas tree light bulb. 

We're sent for a biopsy. They can't do the biopsy, due to it's proximity to his aorta. 

We get scheduled with a cancer specialist in a University hospital. That took 3 weeks. 
In the meantime, we find out his cyst(s) are benign, but are larger than his entire left testicle and need to be removed - AND are causing 70% of all his daily pain. 

His infusion port has 'flipped up' and needs to be removed and replaced. (Surgeon says in over 1000 ports installed, this only the 2x time he's ever seen this!)

His back tooth broke and he needs a crown. 

They can't do ANY of it until AFTER  they 'treat' his cancer reoccurrence or till they figure out HOW they are going to treat it. 

We finally meet the specialist. He immediately recommends surgery to remove the offending node. Probably chemo after. 

He can't schedule it though, until after the 'tumor board' where the surgeon and the radiologist confirm it can be safely removed. 

We get called 4 days later - on our wedding day - to hear the surgeon says Yes, he can remove it.  

The next week we meet the surgeon and his team. He informs us it's 2 lymph nodes, not one.  It's extremely invasive. They may need to remove more colon due to related arteries in the way. It's 3-4 days in the hospital. It's at least 3 days of no food at all. (Fucking ice chips again!!) 

We get it scheduled. 

We attend a family wedding this Sat on his side. He's the 10th of 11 children and the last to get married. They are very Catholic. Very. (We are not. He's an non religious, believer. I'm a respectful atheist.)

I'm the communicator, the organizer, the fixer of all things. I'm the comforter of the emotional. The provider of information. The source for answers to all questions. This wedding is HARD!  

I love my husband very much. I'm not angry at him or his family or mine or our  friends. 

I am angry though. Angry at cancer. Angry at the lack of help or support for either of us. 

Angry at 'prayers'. Everyone is 'praying' for us, and all I can think is ""Well, isn't that special. And lazy"". 

I'm strong and fiercely independent in normal circumstances. I'm capable and logical in a crisis. I compartmentalize well. 

So I'm bitching on reddit to anonymous strangers because I don't know where else to turn. 
There were no threads here and only 6 readers, so I expect I'm speaking into the void. 

.....................................


I miss sex. It's been months and it's going to be months more. 

I'm afraid for him. Afraid of surgery. Afraid they'll find more in his belly, or bladder - because they don't show up on the PET well. 

I'm lonely. I can't add to his burden, even as he tries so hard not to add to mine. 
My close family and friends know what's going on. I don't need to whine to them. 

I created a closed, and then Secret Facebook group for updates. I post very specific and clinical information. It's not a place to whine either. 
Really, I'm not into whining. Much. Often... 

I just need a break. A real break from all of this. 
I'm not going to get one. This is all I know.",2015-06-30 00:28:56

One is kicking the s\*\*\* out of their diagnosis and the other is doing an amazing job of supporting them. The issue is that the support person struggles with body functions and while they are rising to the occasion they are worried that they will not be able to return to the ""way it was"" physically due to the constant communication and descriptions of what is happening to their partner. They feel like they have gone from wife to nurse/friend and are worried about the transition back.

Also their diagnosis came within 6 months of them becoming an (amazing) parent so there is the added stress/craziness. I honestly believe that the convergence of joy and pain is the main issue and the candidness is how they are justifying things.

I assume all support groups are online these days so the region doesn't matter but does anyone have any ideas where a wife/new mother can meet people in a similar situation.

My mum lives with L, has done for pretty much all of L's life. L moved out for a while but missed my mum, so they moved in together, along with L's husband and child and still live together now with L's 3 children and another from her husbands previous relationship. That has meant that as my mum needed more care as she grew older and sicker, L has done it. 
.
In the last few months we have discovered that my mum has cancer of the colon, liver and lungs and it is terminal. She is a walking miracle and has been through some awful shit. She requires more care now, and doesnt want carers so we are doing it. At first me and L and K were all doing night shifts while A was there for a bit during the day (being a man, neither he or my mum is comfortable with him doing personal care). However after a week K decided it was too much for her and she couldn't do night shifts, so it went to me and L doing alternate nights, while K visited during the day to give L some time for her children and me some time for my life. That went on for a few weeks, then L said to change it to 2 nights off 1 night on for me, as she said that she was used to taking care of my mum anyway so I agreed. However, the shifts keep getting longer, i.e. someone will call and ask me to come earlier and I'll end up staying much later the following day. I don't sleep and I am shattered by the time I do get home. Last week L's husband was struggling to cope so she sent him to stay with his parents so I was there even more often and for longer trying to help out. 

Now K has an operation and has to self isolate for a week or whatever and then will be recovering for 4 weeks so cant do the daily visits. So L has asked me continue doing my night shifts which she says are 8 til 8 which they never are, while also coming round and spending the whole following day. I know that she does a lot and that this doesnt seem like a lot in comparison but to be honest I'm tearing up just thinking about it. 

For L, other than the whole cancer thing, in her words not much has changed except that she has to do personal care with my mum. For me, I've given up my whole life. I am married and we have been trying for a baby, in fact I had miscarriages numbers 4 and 5 this year. I've been off sick since the last one because I'm struggling with how to pull myself back from that and now I've got to face losing my mum as well. Not to mention that it is fairly likely (but fingers crossed and touch every piece of wood on the planet that I'm wrong) that A has bone cancer. 

I feel like I'm going out of my mind and I know its selfish (hence why no named names, cos if they find this, I dont know how I'd react) but I'm struggling to cope. I know that L's expectations probably are not unreasonable but they feel that way to me. I just feel like no matter what I do, it is NEVER ENOUGH.  Even when I meet them, they are higher the next time. What do I do?",2020-10-29 12:50:28

I get the mental part of not being able to have kids, yet at the time no Dr. said she couldn't.  Then came the news.  Since then, about 4 years, even tho she is able to do many things...party...go on trips etc. zero sex.

It was just dad and me taking care of her, dad is 73 and it was hard on him as well.

I was very close to her, she is my role  model, she was a fighter, i tried to be there for her, i was her caregiver from February, was by her side the whole time, during the lockdown, until June, that's when the complications began, she was in the hospital nearly 40 days, was very difficult because of the pandemic and restrictions but we managed. Towards the end, we brought her home, did hospice at home, we had someone take care of her, i was helping out occasionally but was not too involved during that period.

After she passed away, the first 3 days i didnt even feel any emotions, didn't really have any thoughts either, my mind was blank, numb maybe, no tears, the tears started after that, something random will bring up some thought or memory and i break into tears, but most of the time i am normal, also had so much to do those first few days that i think i was distracted.

Now though, i feel very disturbed, i am having nightmares, havent been able to sleep the past few nights, i don't feel so good, i can't really express it but i'm not okay. Even during the day, i go around doing things like everything is normal, but not feeling okay. I want to feel better though. I miss her, i have dreams where I feel like i'm longing for her, but also some that are not so good.

Last year at this time he started a new treatment called PRRT after three weeks of hospitalization. He just got his 6 month scan and it’s very promising with no disease progression. This treatment keeps working for months to years so he’s looking at (likely) a stretch of at least a year. In addition, his pain has come down and he has been able to stop taking pain medications. These combined have him feeling like he should work and contribute to the household/society. 

He never had a career. He was diagnosed with cancer only a few years out of college and the field he was working in is no longer one he’s interested in. It also involves tasks he’s not able to do anymore, such as restraining others, sitting on the floor, frequent driving, etc. 

I don’t know what the point of this post is, but I guess I’m trying to find resources for him to help find a) what kind of jobs he could potentially work or b) job training resources. I’d also like to hear anyone’s experiences with going back to work after cancer or with cancer. 

My husband will never be free of disease and is not looking to start a career, but he wants a job that gives him meaning. He’s very worried that he won’t be able to sustain full time work due to fatigue or appointments and will mess up his disability payments and end up out of work again. We have enough in savings that I’m okay with that risk if it makes him happier to work.",2020-06-25 21:07:57

Her Condition (basics I have picked up): Clean scan ~2yrs ago. Multiple spots found on liver. Biopsy taken from her back. Type 1 Diabetic. Prior pancreatitis. Elevated kidney creatinine levels led to the scan that found the spots. Some bowel issues, diarrhea? Not fully sure. Sciatica nerve pain. Does liver cancer have to come from the bowels or lungs? This keeps being mentioned. Also, is liver cancer aggressive post biopsy? Is it most likely already stage 4?

Any advice on mentally coping is also very appreciated. 

My husband's father passed of colon cancer years ago and it's been very hard on the family. However, that was prior to our marriage and I never got to meet him. I need to learn more about how to help her medically moving forward and both him and her emotionally and don't know where to start. He's throwing himself into helping all he can because he thinks he wasn't able to do so for his father due to many issues. I support this and am  bracing for basically what could be one of the most stressful periods in my life. His brother likely feels the same or similar pain after losing his father. We're unsure if he's dedicated to helping or drifting away or just plain overwhelmed. 

Additionally, we're all battling mental illness to varying degrees. I'm most likely bipolar 2 with depressive/mixed states. My husband and his mother are bipolar 1. His brother is also long diagnosed with depression, likely bipolar as well. Fun, I know. My parents have no known mental issues and are there for me to lean on. I just want to do this right.

I don't know where to start, so I will make it short:
was born with optic nerve glioma. Got chemo for a while. It helped, but the tumor was inoperable due to his location direct at the optic nerve (so he's still kinda there, but veeeery small and inactive, dead?).
Had to go to MRT and some other stuff ever year for 19 years.

Now I am 19 years old and fortunately the disease didn't come back, but recently I wanted to gain more information about it, because my parents and I didn't and don't speak much about it.

I found out that only malignant tumors are called cancer (mine was *benign*).
So I am totally confused, angry, and sad(?) right now.

All the years I thought that I had cancer. I identified myself as a cancer survivor and I was proud of it.
It helped me through hard times, to motivate myself again. And now I found out that it wasn't cancer?!?wtf...

Don't get me wrong: I am really happy that I ""only"" had a benign tumor instead of a malignant one and I know that benign ones can also be very dangerous and life-threatening/-changing.

So: Are tumor survivors considered cancer survivors or are they their own thing?
I don't get it...

Just to clarify, earlier this week my dad was suffering from pain, sickness, diarrhea, extreme tiredness etc. A family member mentioned it might be signs of end of life hence my post here. Since then he has actually got much better, we are guessing a bug, but of course, my mind went into overdrive. 

So, today he got his latest CT scan results from the hospital. He has stage 4 pancreatic and liver cancer. When diagnosed at stage 4 the consultant said 'we will only treat this cancer for 6 months and your life is counted in months, not years'. 

HOWEVER, his latest scan results show his liver tumour has shrunk to only 5mm and his pancreatic tumour has shrunk, slightly, but still! 

We are in the UK so under NHS. Although his tumours have shrunk they are still refusing to give further chemotherapy. 

I understand it affects the immune system etc but I just can't understand how if 1 of his tumours is only 5mm away from clearing why they wouldn't carry on. 

He's okay otherwise. His bug or whatever it was has cleared, he has no other symptoms really, bit of pain sometimes.

I am a 25 year old female who is recently married (just over a year). My father in law was diagnosed with stage 3 esophageal carcinoma and has just finished his last week of chemo and radiation. He had to spend the last week in the hospital because he was so weak and couldn’t keep anything down. When he was diagnosed my husband flew to him (we live in MD and he was in AL). Upon receiving the diagnosis we knew what we had to do. We opened our home and our arms to him and moved him in within the next few days. It’s been a really tough transition for all of us, but I always feel guilty when I think of the hardships I’m going through. We are newly married and just moved into our dream home, when within two weeks, we got the diagnosis of his father. I love my father in law very much and am so glad I am able to help him, it’s just been super tough for me. His mood swings and temperament towards me has been nothing but unpleasant. 

Anyways, Wednesday was his last chemo treatment and he’s been home since Friday. He’s incredibly weak and spends most of the day sleeping or vomiting (multiple times a day) or being unable to control his bowels. I’ve dealt with my grandmother going through chemo but I don’t remember dealing with this. I know everyone’s experience with chemo is different, but this feels....wrong. He looks worse now than when we first took him to the hospital over a week ago. He can barely stand on his own and my husband has to help to the bathroom. Has anyone else gone through this?

During the delay on the surgery I started noticing old symptoms coming back. After more scans, his oncologist said that not only was the cancer back, but it had spread to a spot on his spine. Surgery was finally scheduled, and then more chemo was scheduled to follow shortly after. 

He finished his VeIP chemo about a month ago now. His tumor markers have appeared fine and he appears to be the best he has in six months. We find out on Tuesday whether everything is good or whether he needs the stem cell transplant. I am worried sick. So anxious all the time. I feel like our world is finally going back to normal again and it could easily flip upside down in a few days. 

I am only 23 and have been there for him as much as I could be. I would go from work to school to the hospital to sleep in a shitty chair five nights a weeks during his last chemo. I would do all the cooking and all the cleaning at our apt when we were finally out of the hospital. I feel like I was becoming so drained this last time around that I can’t imagine how I would be for the next treatment. Especially since it would be 3 weeks in the hospital at a time. 

I would be there 24/7 for him if I could, but it’s just not realistic with work and school. 

I guess I don’t really have a point to this post other than needing to vent because my mind has been racing all night. It just sucks so much. ",2019-03-03 19:22:30

He has lived with mets to his spine since 2016. He stopped treatment and hospice has been coming to the house since September. My dad was much more coherent during Thanksgiving and I had no trouble making dinner on that Friday and going to a friends with him for dinner on Thanksgiving Day.

My dad has declined— the nurse thinks the cancer has metastasized to his brain. He gets confused about things and has been having hallucinations. He still eats and recognizes people and generally understands what is going on. I am the primary care giver but my uncle has been staying with me since last Thursday. 

I’m pretty exhausted as his most recent weekend consisted of wetting the bed multiple times a night, restless during the day along with some agitation. We have a 2 story house and he insisted on going up and down the stairs to his bed or back down to the living room every hour or so. Needed the help of a baby monitor for that one. (I know his bed should be moved and maybe he should even have a hospital bed, but my dad says “not yet”.)

Christmas has normally been a holiday we celebrate at our house. We used to have so many decorations up and of course a tree. This year I have done absolutely nothing to make this house look like Christmas cheer.  I kind feel like trash for not doing anything. Christmas is next week but I don’t know how my father will be then. There’s New Years. Our birthdays are next month too: I’m turning 30 and my dad will turn 68.

Even using the cane is a constant fight and she 'forgets' it to use it around the house because she doesn't like it. I ordered her a new walker that fixed all of the complaints with her other one in hopes that she might actually use it. She said she would and liked it more, but she has only used it once and yelled at me when I said I was putting it in the car just in case when we went to the store. Well the other day she fell while using the cane and broke her hip. I finally said enough and told her she could not use it anymore and had to use a walker after she got cleared from the hospital. She yelled at me and said she was fine with the cane....after they told her she broke her hip at the ER. She's still there and will probably be for a while more, but my fear is a repeat of this when she gets home (she's fallen several times and it's a miracle that she didn't break anything sooner). I've tried casually mentioning it so it might feel like her idea, I've tried a new walker that has none of the issues she complained about the other walker and played it up as a fun new toy, I've tried just flat out saying enough. She just gives me grief and keeps doing whatever she wants when she thinks I'm not looking (I can't watch her 24hr a day - I have to sleep some time). She has already proven that she will do this after getting minor injuries from falls and such in the past, so I'm running out of ideas to keep her from hurting herself. A wheelchair will turn into WW3, but the new walker converts into a transport chair which was helpful at the hospital before the was admitted.   


I'm feeling like I just won't be able to keep doing this for much longer. It's been about 6 years since her Stage 4 breast cancer diagnosis, and she's gone downhill fast this past year - my father died from lung cancer a couple years before her diagnosis, and I'm an only child. She won't let anybody else do anything for her but me (my husband does whatever he can, but she won't let him do hardly anything but go get food, and she refuses to let our friends help when they offer), and I'm about shot with caregiving and the constant fights of keeping her from being seriously hurt on top of everything else. I hate to say it, but it's been a relief having her at the hospital right now as she tends to follow advice from medical professionals even if they say the exact same thing she gave me a hard time over. She's still texting and calling me when we're not at the hospital, so I'm still having to stop everything regularly, but I'm not having to worry about her getting hurt from doing something she shouldn't because I'm not right there.",2018-10-06 11:22:18

 In January I became my mom's infusion trip buddy. Her treatment center is about 3 hours away from our town and my work schedule is more flexible than my step dad's so I've been driving her to treatments and staying with her until it's time to go home. I've been involved in almost every oncologist visit since then as well, and I think the real tipping point for this rush to get things happening was when I heard a doctor say, ""Because you are so young, this will likely be what kills you."" 


Since then I feel like I've pushing for things to happen before I lose her.  My boyfriend and I have been living together for about 3 years. We had talked about getting married before, but it was always more of a someday/later/no rush kind of conversation. Now I'm getting impatient about it because I want my mom to be there to see me get married. We've talked about having kids in the same way, this is also something I've been thinking about more, even to the point where I'm saving money and making other lifestyle changes in order to prepare for these things.

My husband is incurable, but probably has ""some years"" ahead of him according to the doctors. He is on maintenance chemo, and having biological children is out of the question. Even if he is still fertile after the chemo and radiation he had years ago, the maintenance chemo would most likely cause birth defects and complications.

I always said I was fine with not having children of our own. I stand by that point. I love children and always planned to have children, but also always considered adopting or being a foster parent. I also worked with kids all day and did not have the emotional energy needed to be a good parent.

However, now I have a new career that is MUCH less stressful. In addition, I'm going to be making more money (although it would still be tight if we had a child). I'm also getting older and I can just feel my biological clock. I know this all sounds ridiculous, but my SIL is having a baby girl and so is a good friend. Just this last two weeks I've had three other friends announce their pregnancies. Every time I see this it's like a stab in my chest. I never used to feel this way. I started crying at work when someone was showing off their three month old daughter. 

I've looked into it and because my husband is terminal, we are unable to foster. If we wanted to adopt, it would be a difficult and expensive process and even then we may not be successful. In addition, do I really want to put a child through losing their parent? Especially a child who has already gone through so much to end up needing adoption?

I feel so selfish, but I don't know how to move forward. I feel myself pulling back from my husband and avoiding intimacy because all it does is give my body hope which means a whole month of pregnancy dreams...

Basically, my brain knows that having children would not be a good idea. It would be too much stress on the child, my husband is extremely anxious and would have difficulty with a child, and we don't have the finances to provide the kind of life I would want. But I don't know how to stop myself from having these extreme emotional reactions to all of the babies/mothers around me. I don't know how to stop my dreams.

Also, I am afraid my boyfriend is using his cancer as a desperate way to keep me around.

1. He got a small tumor (doctor did not know it was cancer yet) the year he and I started texting. The tumor caused him nausea and lightheadedness, I believe. He didn't tell me about it until a month after we were dating. We have been dating on and off starting in July / September. He said he found out his tumor was cancerous: a pea-sized astrocytoma. Shortly after he got started on chemo therapy, I moved in with him to comfort him and help him sleep because he says he cannot sleep more than a few hours a night without me. He also says he cannot jerk off because he cannot orgasm without me. It seemed kind of strange here and there.

2. He spat blood in the shower one rare time I would not join him. The next time I did not join him, he was being dramatic and vocal: talking aloud to himself at a slightly raised volume so that I could coincidentally hear him. It screams ""give me attention"".

3. He spits blood often on nights that I do not text him while he is at work.

4. He spits blood immediately after he sees me accidentally looking at a muscular guy on computer. This is just too much of a coincidence.

5. He won't let me be near when he vomits, I have never heard him wretch, I've never seen him vomit blood until he has already been doing it for a while, and he won't let me be there during his chemo IV... seems fishy. It seems like he is hiding something.
 
He does not have one of those IV ports for getting chemo. Wouldn't the chemo destroy his veins if he didn't have one?

Before he was on chemo and before I knew he had cancer, when sensing our relationship was at an end, he would go into a manic episode where he would basically need help walking so he could lay down. I eventually did break up with him over text because I know I am easily swayed by emotions in person. I got back together with him later.

I am super emotionally-sensitive and everyone says I am naive. I kind of have a record of being the most naive person imaginable, but I'm trying to be careful and do the right thing for my boyfriend. I feel emotionally exhausted and in defense mode, so maybe I'm being paranoid.

My mother was diagnosed with Stage IV Ovarian Cancer last year in January. It's spread... well, everywhere. Lungs, liver, intestines, parts of her spine. The morbid part of me is just waiting for it to inevitably spread to her brain if it hasn't already (and the insurance company keeps refusing the PET Scan, joys). She's on her 5th set of combination chemo (Taxol/Avastin), after already trying various others including Cystoplatin and Doxol. This is actually her second time using Taxol.

She has trouble eating. A lot. It's at the point where she's lost 5 pounds in just 3-4 days because she says she can't, because she feels full all the time. And what little she does eat, ends up getting thrown back up. Even after taking Zofran. She can't even eat something mush like porridge or mashed potatoes (barring how much she hates the texture of both and related foods).

I'm not sure what else I can do. This is but one of many issues, but it's also the biggest one. She can't get better or stronger without eating. But short of admitting her to a hospital for malnutrition — which she will vehemently refuse and have a panic attack over — I'm not sure what can be done. She used to love food, and now she can barely touch it. I'll never forgive myself if she ends up starving to death because of this shit-tier disease.

Does anyone have any suggestions?",2017-08-04 13:23:21

It's been a rollercoaster since then of scanxiety, targeted gene therapies, radiation, etc. Bad news then good news then bad news again. I'm only 31; he is 42.

I already deal with severe anxiety/panic disorder and depression, which has gotten way worse while dealing with his situation. I am not cut out to be a caretaker - sickness makes me want to run and hide, and I can barely deal with my own issues, especially with everything going on in the world right now. My partner and I were engaged at one point (he proposed about a month or two after his diagnosis) but I called off the wedding because it was too much stress for me.

I thought I had a great support group though. But lately ALL my close local friends have been MIA - and I don't know if it is because of my partner's situation, subconsciously or not. I'm not even the kind of person who is moping about when we hang out or constantly talking about cancer stuff - I like to have a good time and need the distraction from all that. So I don't think my company is a downer or anything, unless the very fact that he has cancer freaks them out (even if I don't bring it up and seem cheerful) and they don't know how to deal with it? I don't know.

I expect this kind of thing from acquaintances, I guess, but not my very best friends. I am desperately lonely all the time now, and wish they would be there to support me (us) when I need it the most. My messages and texts are getting ignored most of the time, not responded to for days. I don't know what to do. It's physically painful...

I guess this is mostly just a venting rant. If anyone has advice, that would be great. I just feel like I am at the end of my rope sometimes. I don't even have the romantic relationship I once did. It's like I am in limbo and this constant state of high stress for the past almost 2 years... It's just not sustainable.",2017-06-08 12:16:23

Everyone assumes I'm going to pop out a baby soon because I obviously love children. A lot of people have been asking me lately if I have kids and I usually just say no and that's the end. Some people, though, will start on and on ""Well, you'll want them soon!"" Etc.

I just try to brush it off, ""My students keep me plenty busy!"" Or ""I have my nephew to keep me on my toes."" But these people will just keep going! 

I usually end up just being blunt and saying my husband and I can't have kids. A lot of times these people are parents at my school and I don't really want them to know about my husband being sick. Even then, though, they'll say there's always options!

I want to scream at them. I have no desire to put a child through what we're going through. I don't have the energy to be a good mother. We don't have money to be parents. And I'm not going to intentionally become a single mother. While my husband looks healthy, he has never been anything but terminal.

He pretty much only leaves the house for doctor's appointments and errands. The last 6 months or so it's a chore to get him to do anything. He gets a lot of pain and symptoms whenever we have something coming up. We had so many concert tickets this year that just went to waste because he didn't feel up for it. I'm having to force him to go to family events like his nephew's birthday party and Christmas Eve. 

Besides this being unhealthy for him, it's really wearing me down. I feel like a jerk for trying to do fun things for him. I am missing out on things I want to do because he waits until the last second to back out and I can't make alternate plans. 

We've been planning to go to Boston for a hockey game since the summer. It's my dad's treat. It's also the anniversary of our engagement (which happened in Boston) and I've been looking forward to it for months. Not today he's saying he didn't feel up for it. He just went to the doctors today and all his scans are fine. The APRN mentioned, though, that he should try to see the cardiologist maybe instead of going to Boston. The cardiologist can't see him anyways, but now he's decided that the APRN thought it was too risky for him to go out for the night. 

I think he just doesn't want to go. But I'm going to be a selfish bitch if I make him go and he's miserable and in pain the whole time.

February of 2014 he went to check in with his oncologist and found out the cancer was back. Has it in every lymph node. At the time my dad didn't want to do any type of treatment as ""he felt fine"". Still continued working. December of 2015, I got onto him about getting himself checked out. He was having difficulty walking and was wheezing. (He was also very overweight and has high blood pressure, blamed those symptoms on his medicine).  

Fast forward to October 2016. There were some issues with his prostate and bladder, went to the doctor and his WBC levels are over 20,000. Cancer is raging. 2 weeks later finally got a PET scan not only is the lymphoma in every lymph node but also his liver, spinal cord and bone marrow. Thankfully the cancer hasn't mutated but it still could.  

Went to visit my parents over Christmas. He's lost 70lbs and looks awful. He hasn't even started treatment yet and I'm worried that this is only going to get worse. My dad is his own boss and still believes he can work. He isn't eating meat, just hot and sour soup from different local Chinese places. I'm afraid he's malnourished and secretly trying to kill himself by only eating 1,000 calories or less a day. Medicaid just denied his chemo treatment for the second time and the out of pocket cost is $13,000 for these chemo pills.

Because he is home all day, but not completely incapacitated (the disability was more due to vision/his particular job being risky), he had been doing most of the daily chores around the house. He does the grocery shopping, over half the cooking, loaded dishwasher, his laundry, and takes care of the dog and garbage.

I worked, tutored, babysat, did my laundry, unloaded the dishwasher, vacuumed and did the bathroom on the weekends, and cooked the remaining meals.  

It was a great system.  Everything was pretty equally distributed and everything got done.

But now he was in the hospital all last week for unexplained pain.  The pain is making his fatigue worse, and also (obviously) making him extremely uncomfortable. When he takes the pain pills, he becomes very dizzy and disoriented and often naps. As such, we're trying to come up with a new symptom until his pain recedes.

How have you handled household chores? It would be unrealistic for me to do everything with my schedule (I often work 50+ hours a week before my extra jobs).  Should I try hiring a maid for some of the things? I feel weird asking family members to come wash our stinky, sweaty sheets (night sweats), but would feel less weird paying a stranger, haha.

This has not been too time consuming, because he is able to take care of himself throughout the day.  However, he does occasionally need rides to the doctors if he's not feeling up to driving and there is always the chance of needing more intense treatment that could lead to having to take time off.

I have been working at my current job for 5 years and hoarded my sick days.  My school is probably closing, and I've been looking at new jobs.  I've been using those sick days to take him to necessary appointments as he prepares for surgery next week.

My concern is how to approach asking a prospective employer about work flexibility without seeming like a liability.  As a teacher, time off isn't always the easiest thing to come by.  I'm looking into childcare jobs that may offer more flexibility (being able to make up the hours by working later, etc.) or library jobs (where I could work the weekends/evenings) but I don't want to go into an interview seeming like I'm going to be difficult.

He has no wife, no children, and really no friends. He's been pretty ""nomadic"" during his life and has never put down any roots. My Mom made the decision to take him in to her home and care for him. 

She did this with her mother when her health was failing a few years back. It was VERY stressful and eventually her care became to involved and she had to go to a nursing facility. She has since passed away. 

Anyway, my husband and I went to visit this weekend and my uncle's condition is rapidly declining. They do have hospice for him and they have been wonderful with assisting in his care and providing support to my mom as well. It was a hard 2 days for everyone. My mom is so overwhelmed and I feel like I need to do something to support her....I just don't know what to do other than be there for her. I live over an hour away, so ""pop in visits"" aren't really an option. She was really down on herself and saying that she feels like she just can't handle it. She feels like she isn't doing enough and we've reassured her that she is doing a GREAT job. 

My mom is a complicated person and so is my relationship with her. She has depression and anxiety and this is just wearing on her so much.

The days she doesn't get out of bed until noon when she had gone to bed at 9 or 10 the night before. The days she has a migraine I wonder if it will be manageable or will it only continue to increase. She has outlived many with her diagnoses and her prognosis is not good. She is no longer undergoing any medical intervention to control the growth of her current tumor. Her plan is to go into hospice next month. 

It seems that she is continuing to wrap up her affairs and with that she is shutting down her relationships. She speaks to a small group of confidants but that group does not include me or her children. The energy she does appear to have symptom free throughout the day is spent on herself sometimes just a few hours of TV. The kids don't understand, how can they? At this point it seems like when the time comes that she is truly sick her actions will seem justified.  She is making it very difficult and at this point there will be a huge sense of relief once she passes.

She's had multiple surgeries as well as radiation and chemo. At this point all of her deficits were byproducts of  medical treatments and not the cancer itself. She has grown tired of losing herself to the treatments and has stopped her chemo that was only keeping the tumor from growing. She is starting to experience some symptoms from the tumor but it's slight. 

She has enough energy and interest to do the things that she wants and unfortunately that ultimately benefit herself. Expectations on her around the house are zero but with young kids and a full time job any help would be appreciated. I think the worse part is that this work extends to her relationships. She is not investing or doing her part in our relationship but I'm an adult and can understand the why and show her grace. The kids are more and more frustrated because she is turning into a really bad mother and they do not understand. They know she is sick but they see she is able to do things for herself and just seem to care less and less about them. They are pulling away, she is getting more angry and selfish, and the cycle seems to be escalating. 

The kids and I at this point are just getting by but things are really not good and she adds so much tension to the house.",2020-11-02 14:28:55

He has been given heavy chemo treatments, and its taking a serious toll on him. **He was already a small kid, at around 4""3 inches,** ***maybe*** **4""4, weighing probably 55 pounds**. Since he started chemo, he's gotten smaller. I don't mean just like he's lost weight, I mean he literally, got smaller. He is about 3""8 now, maybe 3""9, weighing probably high thirties? None of his clothes really fit him. Is that a common or normal thing? **I don't feel comfortable talking to the doctors since I feel that's my parent's place, not mine**. I'm only a few years older than him, but its weird, because his height and facial features make him look younger. **He looked about 9, now he looks 6-7, but at the same time, his deathly pale/green skin tone and deep set, sunken eyes make him look old, and like he's seen things people won't see in three lifetimes**. Such hurt in his eyes, its hard for me to look at him in the eyes, which only hurts him. If he eats **ANYTHING**, its almost guaranteed he'll spend the next hour or two vomiting. And then comes diarrhea after that. I'm also worried, because he started doing this thing where he just spaces out at times, like no one is there. He doesn't realize anything. **He doesn't hear us, doesn't feel us if we touch him, just sits there looking forward blankly, looking scared or in pain**. I can throw my hand a centimetre from his face and he won't realize. I've held his hand, hugged him, cried into his shoulder, did anything to pull him out of his trance whenever he gets into it, but nothing works and he just stares right through us like we aren't there. Once it starts, we just have to wait it out. **He's in his own world**. Is that normal for kids? I'm assuming its either his brain choosing to live in itself, and not the real world, as a self defense mechanism, or maybe its just his body trying to save energy? Please let me know, thanks.

My wife finished breast cancer treatment about a year ago. At the time we knew she had a brain tumor, but we were in China and wanted it treated in the US. Fast forward to Thursday and my wife had a seizure because the tumor had grown and was pressing on her brain stem. They did a CT and MRI of her spine and found mets. The oncologist called them marrow replacing lesions. There was also an alarming amount of fluid around her lung. They removed 800 ml, but said there was more. They said this is a sign of mets around her lungs, but stopped short of saying mets are definitely there. 

Friday they did the craniotomy and removed the tumor. Everything went smoothly and my wife is recovering now. We are expecting to get the pathology report back Monday or Tuesday this week. Once it's finished I will talk with the oncologist and neurology team about what the next step will be. The problem is, I am totally out of my depth.

My husband was diagnosed over 7 years ago (although technically his first tumor was 10 years ago). People aren't actively offering to help anymore because things have been stable for a while now. 

Things have gotten a lot worse the last couple of weeks. He's going through radiation and all of his symptoms have gotten worse. He is currently running a fever and we're back and forth with the hospital to see if we need to drive down to the ER. He is more exhausted and having to take pain meds occasionally that knock him out. This means a lot of the housework stuff that he was doing is falling to me.

We're blessed that his dad is retired and is able to drive him to things and my parents offer to drive as well. I could use some help. though. I'm working full time and in grad school full time. I'm exhausted and it would be helpful to have someone help with cooking/groceries/housework. Any suggestions for how to open the door to these conversations without seeming whiny?

Had to do this for Mom as she has bought about 4 pay channels either thinking they were included, or by getting confused and pressing random buttons on the remote.

I was able to catch a couple of the purchases, but some made it through and already charged her for the month. This setting has already been incredibly helpful as it has let her know she was about to purchase stuff several times just today, and I don't need to regularly monitor her subscriptions anymore.

Hubby is a Vietnam Vet with PTSD, AAA, BiPolar I, Skin Cancer (both Squamous and Basal, over 23 surgeries for it so far), Ankylosing Spondylitis, etc., etc,. etc.  

We have been married forever, as in 30+ years.  Two months ago, he found a lump in his neck. He had been getting his teeth worked on and he thought it might be an abscess from one of them, but it didn't hurt.  After fighting with the VA about getting in to see a dentist, getting a cat scan, biopsy, on and on, he finally had a ultrasound biopsy two weeks ago, where it looked like it was just an abscess as when the needle went in, they started pulling what looked like pus out and the tumor collapsed.  Or so we thought.

On Thursday, they called and said they needed to see us THAT DAY.  Yeah, my thought was ""it is cancer"" but they said it was an abscess, so...nah. It's Squamous Cell carcinoma, likely metastasis from someone else.

Hubby will not discuss this. Does NOT want to talk about it, I read the path report online, and he asked me what it said so I told him. He is NOT dealing with it well.  I am scared, I feel this time is different, but have been caregiving for all this time now and won't back down, but I have no one to talk to.  

Told my sons and my ex DIL, and she promptly made it ALL about her, which is one reason she is ex, she called my son, her ex, up and exploded in tears and everything causing him to freak out.  

I don't know why I am writing this other than I am in shock, scared and alone and can't talk to hubby until he is ready to deal, which may, in his case, be never, to be honest.   ",2018-12-23 06:41:25

It seems like everything he tries to eat irritates his throat and he starts coughing and then usually gives up trying to continue eating.
I know once he starts eating and his body starts to heal there’s a good chance his taste buds might come back. (The doctors emphasize MIGHT, but I’m hopeful)

Hi Reddit,

I’ve been holding off on posting until I knew for sure. The doctors are doing a full body scan sometime next week, but they say they’re 99% sure my sister has Hodgkins Lymphoma. I know that survival rates are good, and from what I know my sister has a good attitude about it. I won’t see her until tomorrow. What can I expect? How can I help? Would I likely be a candidate for bone marrow transplant if that’s necessary? A doctor maybe able to answer most of those questions, but has anyone else had experience with a sibling getting Hodgkins? How did that affect the family? What gets me is that I’ve felt distant from my sister, and I’ve been trying to connect with her again. I don’t want to lose her. There’s a lot I don’t know right now, and so I’ll just have to be patient. Just wanted to start conversations with strangers on the internet for support",2017-11-12 06:43:01

Last year we consulted with ayurvedic specialist doctor He suggested taking more antioxidants which can lower growth of a tumour BUT can't invert his disease.   

He is a good man. In whole life, he did hard work for his family and their happiness. We know we can't cure this disease but We all are trying hard to buy more time for him.

My husband is currently on his second round of chemo for Stage IV colorectal cancer. He has a 48-hour pump that is getting disconnected today. During his first round he got a bit of chemo brain, but this round he's been foggy nearly the whole time. 

He's bored and extremely frustrated that he can't keep track of what he's doing. We live on the west coast, so we can't go outside due to the smoke. He's tried sewing masks, reading, or watching TV, but it makes him more frustrated. He tried to watch his favorite movie yesterday, and it took him several hours. 

Does anyone have suggestions on how to get through it at home? We're currently trying a Star Wars marathon, but he wanders a lot. I suggested coloring while the movies are on. 

He's also worried that chemo brain will get worse with every round. In your experience, has the level of fogginess been variable with treatments?

Thank you! (Cross-posted)",2020-09-13 02:00:39

I’ve posted here a few times before. My FIL was diagnosed with esophageal carcinoma last May and has since gone through the treatment and had surgery to remove the cancer from his esophagus. It’s been about 10 weeks since the surgery and he’s been back to the hospital twice due to complications. His bladder is no longer able to function properly so he will have a catheter for the rest of his life and a feeding tube. The doctor was adamant that he would be “like his old self” by May. Here we are two weeks out and he’s in pain like he was before the surgery. This last week his health took a big turn and he’s been unable to provide basic care for himself. He’s become reclused to the bed and cannot hold down any liquids or solids. His urine is an orange rust color and he’s lost about 6 pounds this week. His heart rate has bounced around from 110-130 with lower blood pressure. We know this all likely means he’s severely dehydrated but he refuses to go to the hospital since they will just “hook me up to an IV and send me home”. His pain levels have seemed to spike and my husband and I don’t know what to do anymore. We are both in our 20’s and lucky to be working from home during COVID-19 but will be unable to care for him once this all ends. It is beginning to take a toll on us as we don’t understand why his health took a turn. Maybe he’s just given up? Today, he complained of his lower back hurting and I’m almost certain it’s his kidneys. He’s been on oxy since last September every 4-6 hours and he’s barely able to make it through that timeframe now with his pain. Any suggestions? We called his doctor and they just put him back on an all liquid diet through his feeding tube. We took him in to radiology last week and they found no reason why he is throwing up land liquid or solid he is eating. Could it be his body is beginning to shut down? Do we look for a nursing facility or hospice for pain management? We are very young and have no idea where to go. His doctors won’t answer right now due to coronavirus and we are really very overwhelmed.",2020-04-20 02:07:06

598,caregiver stress,1,f8zqcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/f8zqcl/caregiver_stress/,1,1582613073.0,"Hi everyone. My aunt( 72 years old) was diagnosed 6 months ago with small cell lung cancer with metastases to the liver and lymph nodes(stage 4). Doctor gave her 6 months to live without treatment and 8 with. Now my aunt is terrified of anything that has to do with hospitals and doctors and needles and everything medicine related so she never got herself checked out. She never got married so never had children either.

She was started on chemotherapy and she did 4 rounds with good results showing that the tumors she had, had shrunk and others were so small that they weren't visible or were completely gone. Then sh\*t hit the fan: She had a cold and they put her on antibiotics but then the antibiotics did nothing so she had to take other antibiotics. Her cold went away but she had a heart attack in december, which means that she had gone 2 and a half months without treatment. Her doctor told us that she needs to get a ct scan of her head, thorax(lungs & heart), upper and lower abdomen. Turns out that during those 2 and a half months without treatment cancer had a party and some tumors grew again and now she even has a new one in her right lung. Her doctor decided no more chemo so now he started her on immunotherapy.

Last weekend(around the 17th) she developed a cough so I had a doctor come to the house because my aunt is scared sh\*tless of hospitals and since my father died of cancer in 2012 she hadn't seen the inside of a hospital until August when she had to stay in the hospital for 2 weeks. He gave her 10ml of dexamethasone and tomorrow I have to get her to the hospital for immunotherapy(once every 21 days).

My aunt even without her diagnoses is a horrible human being. Last year she wouldn't even give water to our other dying aunt. She's extremely mean and constantly insults you and she makes the type of jokes that nobody would even consider them to be a joke if they heard them. I can't stand being here any more. I gave up my life for the past 6 months to take care of her and not even a kind word or a thank you. 

My brother recently got married and became a father, my cousin lives on an island with her family so I can't expect any help from her and my other cousin also has a family and works 13 hours a day so I'm basically on my own. My cousin who lives an hour away, doesn't even call. The last time he called was for Christmas. His sister the last time she called to check in on our aunt called somewhere in late August/ early September.  My brother does visit us at least once or twice a week and brings food sometimes and calls every day.

I do everything for my aunt since I live in her house: cook, clean, bathe her, pay her bills, take her to doctor's appointments and her therapy, find doctors to come to the house to check her out. My only break from her is when I go shopping for food or coffee to bring back to the house. I can't stand this much longer. I've had more than enough and the end is nowhere in sight. I don't know if a job will be waiting for me when I go back to my city since the last time I worked was in August. I'm 35 years old and am completely isolated. I have no friends here. I also have to deal with her f\*cked in the head neighbour who thinks that I'm isolating my aunt from her because she doesn't get the fact that it's f\*cking flu season and my aunt even with the flu shot she had, has a weak immune system and a simple cold can kill her but no I'm the asshole here. My aunt also used to buy her neighbour cigarettes and give her money from time to time so since I've been staying with her and since I haven't allowed her visiting my aunt she hasn't been getting any money. I could write a book but I guess that's all for now...If you want leave me a comment here or message me so time passes by a little bit faster.",2020-02-25 06:44:33

600,SIL suffering seizure-like episodes; all testing is coming back clear. Has anyone else experienced this?,1,f3q7bk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerCaregivers/comments/f3q7bk/sil_suffering_seizurelike_episodes_all_testing_is/,2,1581703871.0,"Sorry if this is long; I'm trying to be as comprehensive as I can.

My SIL is 52 and was diagnosed with Stage IV metastatic breast cancer in March 2019. We're coming up on a year. In that time she's responded well to chemo and did 16 rounds before switching to tamoxifen, which was some time in late June/early July 2019. She's on a plethora of other medications as well, including anti-nausea pills, painkillers, an anti-depressant/anti-anxiety, fentanyl patch, etc.

In the months leading up to her diagnosis she was increasingly light-headed and dizzy, which we (and her doctors/nurses) attributed to her low blood counts post-diagnosis.

However, since July 2019 her light-headedness and dizziness have evolved. Initially SIL would feel a dizzy spell coming on with enough time to get to a seated and safe position. Then it starting hitting very suddenly, and she was at risk of falling. Luckily she was still maintaining consciousness and always rebounded within minutes of each incident. Then she started experiencing narrowed vision and loss of hearing, trembling/jerking of her arms and legs, extreme nausea, and excruciating headaches once the episodes (as she calls them) passed. This all has been progressing and her symptoms/side effects have grown more acute over the last several months. It's only been since about December 2019/January 2020 that she actually experienced one of these ""episodes"" while we were at an appointment with her oncologist. At that time, her blood pressure came back normal for her - usually on the lower side, around 117/75. Nothing alarmingly low.

The latest: she actually suffered one of these ""episodes"" a couple days ago while by herself, passed out, and when she woke up she had vomited on herself and the couch. She has no memory of any of it and no idea of how much time had passed.

I'm not complete on the timeline, but since June of 2019, in addition to PET scans every 3 months, she has also had three brain MRIs and two spinal MRIs, none of which have showed any evidence of new growth. Everything keeps coming back clear. She has met with a neurologist and done an EEG/EKG, which also came back normal. She has an appointment next week for a 24-hour video EEG, for which she'll be admitted to the hospital so that the doctors can observe what's happening with her neurologically leading up to, during, and after one of these ""episodes."" All of her blood work each month is in the normal range, except for the tumor marker numbers, which are on the rise. However, we've seen no new evidence of growth in any of her PET scans/targeted MRIs.

Yesterday we were at her monthly check-in with her oncologist for blood work, and in the two-hour span we were there, my SIL had two milder ""episodes."" At one moment she and I were talking in the waiting room, the next she was hunched over, trembling slightly, and extremely incoherent. Luckily a nurse was nearby and assisted me with her. We were supporting her to sit upright and as the nurse was asking her questions, my SIL squinted up at her with a look of utter confusion on her face and, after several seconds of grasping for words, asked her, ""Did you say something to me?"" Afterward she had a headache, was nauseated, light-sensitive, and exhausted to the point of falling asleep. After consulting with her neurologist, her oncologist prescribed her 500mg of Keppra, an anti-seizure med, to be taking twice daily. Her first dose was early evening yesterday when I got her home and settled.

The most frustrating part is that every single test to determine what this is or what's causing it is inconclusive. I know my SIL is petrified that the cancer has spread to her spine and/or brain and it's just not showing up yet. It just confounds me that NOTHING is definitive. I've even asked her doctors if it could be the combination of powerful meds she's on, but they've told me more or less that would not be the cause.

After a half of year of unexplained pain, and after several doctor visits where they insisted nothing terrible was wrong with him, they found a growth in his abdomen during a CT. It's around where his previous cancer was (an extragonadal tumor that's considered testicular cancer, pretty rare). We don't know anything else yet, not even whether the growth is big or small, but we begin dr appointments this Monday. We will see a surgeon this Monday and an oncologist next. We have three kids, ages 9,7, and 3. I haven't had an income in almost ten years and I'm terrified. The last time my husband had cancer he nearly died from the surgery and he spent four months in intense treatment -- so he's scared. I don't know how I'm going to care for my children and my husband. I don't know how I'll do those things and also work if my husband's paid time off runs out. 

I'm terrified to tell my kids. I know I'm overthinking things, but if he should die, I don't know how I would handle everything (he is foreign and his entire family and set of old friends except for me and the kids are still in Europe). My feelings swing from one extreme to the other seemingly without my control. Half the day I won't understand what I was worried about last night, then suddenly I'll be struck with chilling fear. I spend days experiencing inexplicable nausea. I forget to eat. Is this normal? And how can I be his advocate? Is it normal to wait 2 weeks for the first oncologist appointment? Should I be insisting on faster treatment? I'm so frustrated that six months of pain went by and I didn't insist that the doctors do more. I'm ok half the time and the other half the time I'm already imagining how I'll survive without him. ",2018-07-28 04:37:36

The treatment during rehabilitation depends on several factors including the site of the surgery and age of the patient, among others. Additional treatment, like radiation therapy, chemotherapy and exercises may be recommended after surgery to complement the process of recovery. Medicines may be prescribed to patients for expediting the healing process and ensuring a wholesome physical and emotional healing. Oncologists like Dr. Amish Dalal assess the physical condition of patients in order to decide on the necessary rehabilitation. 
Cancer surgeries may necessitate the complete or partial removal of certain affected parts of the body and surrounding tissues that are malignant. Inflammation if any around the surgical wound is not uncommon. Rehabilitation usually offers a wide scope for expediting the healing process. Physical therapy may be advised two or three weeks after a cancer surgery.  Dr. Amish Dalal, an accomplished Surgical Oncologist, examines the patient’s condition post-surgery and recommends the next line of treatment. 
What post-surgery rehabilitation can do for patients
Post surgery rehabilitation aims to treat common symptoms experienced after surgery. The nature of rehabilitation that a patient may require depends on the post-surgical care needed, the type of surgery that was conducted, and the site of the surgery. 
Rehabilitation often proves to be beneficial for relieving patients in the following ways:
•	Reduction in pain arising from the site of surgery
•	Reduction in inflammation around the operated area
•	Increase in the range of motion
•	Boost in physical strength
•	Restoration of regular lifestyle and activities 
Amish Dalal reviews the condition of patients post-surgery and decides upon the necessity of rehabilitation and the course that needs to be undertaken. 
Symptoms that may indicate the necessity for rehabilitation 
Cancer surgery, like any other surgery, requires time to heal completely to enable patients to return to their usual way of life. However, there may be symptoms that impede the healing process. These could be:
•	Fatigue and weakness
•	Sleep deprivation 
•	Depression and anxiety 
•	Pain at the site of surgery
•	Difficulty in undertaking daily activities
•	Inflexibility of muscles
•	Difficulty in concentrating or memorising 
Doctors observe patients after a surgery, both before and after their discharge from the hospital. This helps them know how well the patient is recovering, and in administering the necessary post-surgical care. Doctor Amish Dalal recommends his patients to regularly monitor their health and discuss their progress and concerns with him post surgery.
Here are some professionals that help with post-cancer surgery rehabilitation
A team of experts work in coordination with an oncologist in administering the necessary post-surgery rehabilitation while patients are at the hospital. After discharge, the oncologist may recommend patients to other specialists to aid the process of recovery. 
A team of rehabilitation experts usually includes the following:
Rehabilitation Specialist: Assists patients in achieving the desired range of movement of limbs, and regaining their strength. 
Physiotherapist: Helps patients regain mobility. This is essential for patients who have undergone a cancer surgery that has affected their movement. Those with difficulty in balancing, suffering from loss of muscles due to prolonged bed rest, and patients walking with an assistive device get to benefit from physiotherapy. Patients can also be administered radiation 
Dietician: Patients need to follow a strict diet especially after a surgery, to restore their health. With a thorough knowledge of the daily nutritional needs of patients, dieticians regulate their food intake to monitor the body weight so as to aid in recovery. While there are dieticians to ensure the correct nutritional value at hospitals, patients may consult a professional dietician for advice on the necessary diet chart after their release from the hospital. Amish Dalal recommends patients to follow the prescribed diet during the rehabilitation period.  
Psychologist/Counsellor: During the prolonged course of the illness, some patients may require counselling support. Psychologists counsel patients for their mental and emotional well-being. Amish Dalal, an expert Oncologist, may recommend counselling if needed.

i am 13, my nephews best friend had a brain tumour when he was 4. He went through 2 hrs of chemo and other things. I was quite upset to hear the news, since I knew him. I was looking fir things to do to help, and at 1:00 am, at a sleepover, me and my friend decided to brave the shave. We planned it down to the smallest details. Then, 2 days before we were going to tell our parents, my friend chickenEd out. I still wanted to do it, so I to,d my mum, and decided on the 3rd of April, 2020. I was going to do it at school, with my head teacher shaving my hair, but because of lockdown, she couldn’t. My Nanna stepped up to shave My head, since I was living with her (And still am). On the 3rd, I was petrified, stomach hurt so bad I couldn’t stand up. My Nanna just looked at me, mum took out her phone. I got onto the stool and did it. It was live on Facebook, and I was crying.

For the first year this sub only had a handful of members and I tried to respond to every post personally. I didn't want anyone to feel unheard. Thankfully over the years more and more people have found this sub and now nearly every post has multiple responses.

While I am sad that we all share the same pain caused by the terror that is cancer, I am so happy that you are all here to support one another. Reading the support, love and encouragement in your words brings me to tears.

My mother was a good woman taken from this world far too soon by cancer. So was my grandmother. And my lovely father-in-law left us way too early, from the same cancer that took my mom and grandmother. Mom would be thrilled to know that this community has provided so much support to families going through what we did. Hopefully we have made your struggles just a little bit more bearable.

Much love to all of you.",2020-10-07 06:12:06

22,My Dad died tonight,41,jcnog2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/jcnog2/my_dad_died_tonight/,10,1602932247.0,"I’ve posted on here a few times to vent, so I suppose this will be the last time. (Well I’ll still comment on other people’s posts, offering what support I can, but there won’t be a need to create a new post now)

He’d been declining the last 2 weeks. I flew over from FL to visit him (3 times in 2 months actually), but this time, he really declined from how he was when I first came to how he was today. 

He’d been in such pain that my sister had to call Hospice to make him more comfortable, and he still resisted pain meds for as long as possible. He only recently started allowing us to give them to him, and honestly it was probably bc he was in too much pain to respond most of the time. (There were some humorous moments when he got annoyed enough to respond - like when the one nurse asked him his preference on something and he replied in a whisper “I don’t give a sh*t”, or when my sister and I were trying to ask him if he wanted to be elevated and eventually she was like “I think he wants to” and he freaking started doing a sarcastic clap. I hated seeing him at his end, but at least there were these moments to make me smile now, even if they hurt) 

This last day, the pain increased exponentially, it seemed like the morphine wasn’t working, and his rasping from the congestion just got worse and worse. 

We had a music therapist person associated with the hospice over, and as she was leaving and talking to my sister, I went back in the room and he started gasping for breath. I ran over to him and was trying to encourage him to breath, it’s a little fuzzy tbh but I remember crying and begging him to just please keep breathing, trying to take deep breaths for him to follow. I don’t remember if I got the breathing tube before or after and held it to his face, but at some point he just stopped breathing. 

I texted my sister when it started to happen, and when she hadn’t come I yelled for one of her kids to go and get her, and honestly I’m pretty sure I called her after he stopped breathing but I’m honestly it sure. 

She might have come in at the tail end of it. But yeah, de died right in front of me. 

U know, all I wanted from going to see him, was for him to see that I loved him, even if I don’t verbally express it that much (he once told me that I’m basically him in how I act; very similar, so I always hoped he knew that was why I wasn’t as verbal as my sister). 

It’s a weird way to cope, but even though I was a wreck as it was happening, I hope he saw how much I loved him in those last moments. That’s all I wanted really. Well aside from begging God to at least let my father rest, if not get into heaven. 

I’m not gonna get into the religious contexts of what I believe, but I can only hope that his soul rests until it is time to rise, and that he’ll be able to go home. I hope I can see him again one day. 

I’m crying now. 

I’m gonna be a wreck. 

Honestly it’s ironic too. I was supposed to go back home today, my plane was for 8am, but I canceled last minute... the day I was supposed to leave was the day he left. I don’t really know what that means. But I’m glad I canceled and was there for him until the end. 

Thanks for letting me vent.

Not a day goes by I dont think about you. I remember when you first came into my life like it was yesterday. 
Do you remember the details? I do. How I thought the strange lump was simply caused by a more curable illness. How calm I was going to my ENT doctor and being told perhaps I should visit my endocrinologist. 
How I still hoped for the best despite being told the swelling in my neck wasnt from strep throat and my FNA was inconclusive on both tests. Despite being scheduled for a surgery to remove half of the organ the lump resided on. 
I was 19. My whole life ahead of me. I remember waking up, groggy and disoriented. I had to pee SO badly. I remember a nurse shoving a bedpan under me when I could hardly move and peeing on the bed I was in because what 19 yr old knows how to use a bedpan? I missed my family. What time was it? My throat was so raw from the breathing tube. It's so bright and everything hurts. Voices and lights acknowledged but I cant register their meaning. Finally, I see familiar faces. So worried, so loving. Please dont be upset, I'm still here. Ice chips are so soothing, but I cant talk yet. Fire on my throat, I want to ask my family everything I dont know but i can barely whisper. Morphine, sweet numbing darkness, and I can sleep. 
I rest. I go home a few days later. I remember sitting with my family, loving the moment. My phone rings. ""Yes, Doctor? A second surgery?... I see.. its positive?"" Smiles falling as if cut from a string. ""Please dont worry, it will be okay Mom!"" I say. Repeat surgery, not so bad as the first. Private room this time. But I cant sleep. Needles prod me every hour. Bruises along both arms. My body no longer produces calcium, my mouth is tingling and eyes burn thinking ""Why me?"" 4 days later, I am discharged, never knowing what ""normal"" means again.
Welcome to a lifetime of medicine. Welcome to a lifetime of never having your body be truly ""yours"". Cancer, you are not a friend, but our lives are entwined deeper than the most passionate lovers. You do not define me... but your existence and influence in my life cannot be ignored. Perhaps, one day, we will make peace. Perhaps we may not. I can accept your presence.

But your presence does not define me.
I am still me, despite you. And I always will be. 
Thank you, for showing me who I truly am. I am resilient. And strong. And beautiful. Courageous. Loving. Understanding. Patient. You will never take that away from me. No matter what.

Love, me.",2020-10-12 15:15:01

She fought hard for over 2 years. I was there by he side days leading up to it, I didn’t once leave. She was surrounded by my brothers, her husband and me. 

We were so close. She was my best friend— sometimes I catch myself wanting to call her. Or text. Tell her about the things in my day. But I’ll never get to again. 

I carry guilt. For not visiting he enough at the hospital. 

The last day I saw her while she was awake and coherent, she didn’t want me to leave. Hugging and holding me for over ten minutes straight. And as I walked toward the door she kept telling me how much she loves me, and as I got to the door she looked right at me and said: “you are my entire world.”

Then I left crying. It’s like she knew this was the last time we would get to talk. Because a few days later I got the call that she was reaching her end. They kept her sedated for pain but I still talked to her those two days I was by her side. 

I’m hurting.

My dad passed away last Thursday, the 20th of August. He was diagnosed with colon cancer on the 22nd of July. Not even a month. It all happened so fast. And it's just fucked up. I think that I don't fully understand what happened, I feel numb, and I'm assuming it's a defense mechanism. I don't think I could handle fully understanding what has happened.

I talked to my mom about it today... It feels more as if he's on a trip right now, rather than that he's dead. And you know, we thought he would make it. We were hopeful. But he had metastases in his liver, and the liver can do much but when it can't take it anymore it's practically over. It's just weird. And what's weirder is that time really doesn't matter anymore? And I'm mad at everyone around me. They're asking how I am and what tf am I supposed to answer but ""not good""?

I don‘t really know what I expect from this post. Three hours ago I got the call from the hospital that my mom peacefully died. She had an agressive breast cancer that came back this summer just after her first treatment. She struggled with pneumonia in December, was in a coma in January due to ARDS and fought so well. I really thought that she would make it after mastering all of this.

I feel so empty, I never expected to lose my mom at this age. I‘m an only child and my father is falling apart since the diagnosis, especially in the last few weeks where she was at the palliative ward. I feel like changing roles by being the strong part that my father is expected to be.

How did you overcome your feelings? I know that moving on is the best for me after the time of grief. I have lost my best friend and mom at the age of 22. Realizing that she will not get to know my boyfriend and is not able to see me graduate from university makes me more than sad.

Home life is pretty lonely. I take care of her two cats, I love them dearly. But I'm not sure I'll find love the same way I had loved, and still love, my wife. I'm not sure if I even want to, I'm a pretty old guy and I still feel I'm with her even after death. But in reality, it's surreal to wake up in a bed by yourself. The bed you once shared iwith the person you love and spent every night and morning with sleeping beside.

My dearest Angela, I miss you. You were my sweetheart, you were a wonderful mother, and an amazing grandmother. You've helped me through the grief and pain of losing our boy Armelio from a heroin overdose. But you aren't here to help me through the pain if losing you. My son and my wife, how much more loss will I suffer?

I love you Angela, James.",2020-09-22 19:15:17

My dads thread is short. After the seizure on the fourth we were told we  essentially were living on borrowed time. I am devastated. No matter how much you know its coming, hearing it just rips your heart out. Now he is on hospice care and i am learning to get through my day acting normal. Not to make this about me but i am trying to have some tact so dad can enjoy his last days with us. Planning a day to the shore because he loves the ocean. But my mind cannot get the image of the seizure from my mind. There were no convulsions. I thought it was a heart attack thats how it looked. I did chest conpressions because i couldnt detect any breathing. Each moment burns knowing the last words passed my lips could be my last to him. Its getting harder to pretend i am ok when all i want to do is cry. I know i am not alone, so many before me have been in my shoes, but it still feels like i am stranded. Then i have horrible thoughts like it would have been so much easier if it had been a heart attack. He would have died believing there was hope instead of living in dispare with an ever growing depression. He would have died clear headed instead of an expanded confusion. He would have died with strong legs instead of wobbling to just stand. I hate myself for this thought and yet as he asks me the same question for the fourth time i revisit it. I feel so selfish. I feel so heartless. But im not heartless just broken hearted. I fight to he strong for everyone around me, to be that rational voice. To be that helping hand. Yes i could see a profession, but i truely believe i know most of what they will say. I just need to deal with my emotions. And i cannot deal with them as long as my mom and dad are in my house, and yet i dred when they will go back to their house because it means the moment may come and i would have unknowingly lived that last moment. I know it will eventually be ok...but for now...for now its not.

Less than two weeks ago it took him from me. He went from being an fun, affable, softy (but tough on the outside) to a weak, angry, fragile, man at only 67. He had never looked old previously and it all happened so fast. He had to have three life saving surgeries in 3 weeks, but the cancer just continued to spread and the surgeries were too much for his now thin and frail body to handle. 

The cancer in the bone caused bone breakage and he was in unimaginable pain and suffering. He moaned from pain all the time despite max doses of pain medications. He tried to kill himself all the time by pulling out his oxygen so we constantly watched 24-7 to put him back in for him. He ripped everything (IV, electrodes) out all hours of the day and tried to get out of bed to maybe end it. He told everyone he was done and he wanted to die. This included fighting off the nurses who tired to stop him from hurting himself, and fighting my poor mother who stood by his side for 45 years and they loved each other to death. They were a real-life love story and fought only twice I can ever even remember. 

In his last week he pushed against me, his own daughter because I tried to prevent him from dying. I begged him not to but I could see the fear and pain and anger in his eyes as he ripped out the IV and the electrodes. I had to scream for the nurses because I couldn’t hold him down. 

I have to go back and thank the nurses when the Covid-19 has stopped spreading. Hospice brought him home after everything went downhill. He was finally home with my mom and his three daughters by his side instead of just with my mom in the hospital. We told him he was home and he kept saying “oh great.” And smiling so big despite all the pain. When I saw him his eyes had yellowed and were rolling into his head from the cancer spreading to his liver, he was aspirating because he couldn’t swallow and was hallucinating and out of it and groaning constantly in pain from the cancer in the bones and all over. His appendages were blackened. He was straddling the line between being alive and dead. 

Anyway, my father was born in Italy so he switched into Italian near the end. There was a lot of nonsense he was saying due to the pain medication and all of the things happening to his body. This all happened hours before he passed.

But then he started saying “the light, the light, oh the light.”

My sisters and my mom and I were crying and telling him not to go please.

He then started talking to my uncle who had passed away from cancer maybe 8 years ago and saying “hey Pete how are you doing are you good?” (All in Italian dialect.) 

We said crying “please leave Pete you can’t take him” “we love you but please go away”

I said “hey dad it’s me look at me”

He said “I can’t see anything from up here.” 

I was able to sing to him and he patted his belly and had my moms hand and was moving it back and forth. Every time I told him “I love you.” He responded “I love you too.” He literally couldn’t breathe, and he was so so out of it but he could say those words. He could enjoy my singing and the music. He always loved for me to sing for him.

He then randomly said in the middle of all his nonsense some things very clearly “well of course you miss them. I know you do.”

And to my mother he said “ciao, ___” 

We all finally told him (sobbing hysterically) to go play cards with the relatives in heaven and he could finally let go then. After that he let go. He waited to be home with us and then he let go. 

He died in the morning after a long night in which we had called the Chaplin and hospice nurse who told us he was taking his last breaths. He was so peaceful looking when he finally stopped breathing and the birds were signing like crazy and the sun shone beautifully. 

Also, no one is allowed to take this story and share it for any purposes. It’s only for the purpose of sharing that there is something after and I have given my life to Jesus now. Thanks for listening.",2020-04-06 08:35:39

The ambulance brings him in and a ctscan shows the cancer has possibly spread to the brain. I had my husband take my daughter to his familys house while i deal with this but i dont know how long i can hold my stuff together. I know once it hits the brain we are on the fast end of the spiral so how do i stay positive for my mother while she holds onto what little hope there is.

No one ever says this sort of thing happens. Media makes it seem like it's gradual-- it takes weeks, if not months. But I've been looking at a lot of stuff about late-stage cancer and this is pretty normal. You're fine one day and three days later you're on your death bed.

On August 13 he was taken to the hospital by ambulance due to pain and complications. We assumed he just needed another blood transfusion but he felt a ""pop"" feeling and was doubled over in pain. Due to Covid no one could go with him to the hospital. The poor guy had to go in by ambulance all alone.. later that night he called my Mom and said he was going in for surgery because they found a patch of flesh eating disease on his side. He was informed of the risks and that he may not make it out of surgery, but he wanted to fight it. He made it out of surgery, but his vitals were low. We were informed he may not make the night, but he thankfully did. 
They found another patch on his other side, but because he was sedated my Mom had to make the executive decision whether or not he should go through another surgery. He had another surgery and made it. Again, vitals very low. Temperature was very low, and he had skin and tissue removed from both sides and his back. He was hooked up to so many IVs and medications, as well as a ventilator. 

Things started to look up. He didnt need as many antibiotics, the respirator was only doing 30% of the work, his white blood cell count was going up and he was becoming more alert. He had a tracheotomy so he couldn't talk to us, but he used a letter board to spell out sentances. This was last week. 

On Wednesday we got news his organs were failing, they found 3 new tumors in his stomach and due to his condition could not continue chemo (which we knew would happen), and he was in constant pain. He fought so hard. He never gave up. Even today during his final moments he was still fighting hard.

So about a month and a half ago now, my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 liver cancer with 4 months to 4 years left to live. Truth be told I've been crying about the diagnosis itself since I found out but I had no idea how crazy this was going to be. 
Two weeks after my moms diagnosis she started chemo and had an extremely negative reaction to it. The process of chemo hurt my moms liver more and put her into almost complete renal shut down. Consequences we finally realized after her being hospitalized for a week straight after 2 days of chemo. 

Last week my parents told me that my mom will not be undergoing dialysis to prolong her life nor will she be resuming chemo to prolong her life either. Last week she had 1-2 weeks left to live. Today I am bringing my boyfriend with me to see her for the last time. 

I'm not ready to say goodbye to my mom yet. Shes only 58 and I'm only 22. For a large portion of my life I have essentially acted as my moms guardian bc her perception of reality is so skewed. It is to the point where no one seems to understand what shes saying and brushes it off to ""shes talking in code and is crazy"" when in all actuality she just struggles with finding the word or never learned the concept. I'm one of the only people that my mom has said understands her. Shes genuinely the only member of my immediate family that I have been close to and I'm not ready to let her go yet.

It kills me to see such a genuinely kind woman be struck with this and know that I almost definitely wont see her again after today. And it kills me that she'll never see me move into my first home, graduate college, get married, or have kids. And it hurts that shes dealt with emotional (and possibly some physical) abuse for pretty much her entire life and never felt strong enough to get away and be free. 

And while I will tell you this again later mom, I love you and I hope when you pass you go without pain and that then you can finally experience and enjoy some freedom I'll miss you and this will probably be one of the hardest deaths I've dealt with in my life, but as long as you aren't suffering anymore, i will understand and will be happy for you.

I had previously lost my father when I was 11 due to an motorcycle accident and I couldn’t help comparing the two and which was worse. Is it worse not knowing when your parent is going to die, and then it just happens out of the blue, without saying goodbye? Or is it better to know when they are going to die, so you can say goodbye, but you have to watch them become someone else (especially in the case of brain cancer where it alters moods and states of being similar to Alzheimer’s). I still cannot choose, but both are shitty.

She has taken a lot of painkillers at this point, and we have tried a lot of methods (from the ""traditional"" to the ""alternative"" ones) but we always come back to the painkillers.  


Now...the thing is that the baby is getting bigger and the pain is getting worse. But the baby cannot be born right now, we have to wait 6 more weeks. The main problem is that the painkillers that work for her are now forbidden due to complications and bad things that could happen to the baby. So she has to deal almost all by herself with the pain, that overwhelms her.   


**It's very hard.**   


Time passes so slow. I have to keep going to my 9-5 office job, cannot be with her all the time, and if I could there's little I can do for her. I'm with her, give her companionship, attend her, love her, assure her I will be there forever for her, but that's all I can do. I'm worried that the pain she's in will damage her in a psychological way, or worse, that she cannot withstand the pain and something awful happens. There are a lot of complications also with the baby, as contractions tend to happen if she's in a lot of pain.  


So...It's a very difficult situation, and I need a little support. Thank you for reading.",2020-03-02 22:48:35

i love my dad. i wish this hadn’t happened to him, so soon after my brother and i moved out on our own. i wanted my parents to enjoy their golden years together, i wanted to see them grow old together. i love them. but it seems like that’s not going to be the case.

78,Feeling helpless.,23,c34snl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/c34snl/feeling_helpless/,6,1561112134.0,"First time poster. been feeling really down.

My dad was diagnosed with esophageal cancer stage 4 august 14th 2017. Since then he has been part of 2 trials and had 3 different chemo treatments. The first trial showed alot of promise before it maxed out. One chemo was awful. One only kinda worked and now this trial. But...

This week my dad was told that not only is treatment not working but that things have gotten worse and he is too weak to start any new treatment. He doesn't eat that much and doesnt drink water and he fights with my mom whenever she tries to get him to do stuff to make him stronger. He has become so emotionally moody that he has had abusive moments going as far as to tell my mom if he dies it is because of her nagging. I tried talking to him but he doesnt see rhe problem. I even asked him if he wants to keep fighting and he says he hasnt given up yet but his actions dont agree. 

Anyway 

 I have suggested multiple times that they both talk to professionals about their emotions but neither will. I have been their emotional support for years but i have a newborn and am barely holding it together since this news, i dont think i can bare the weight of their emotions as well. Its rough and its hard to find anyone who understands without looking at you with pity. This is not my fight to fight, it is my dads, if he chooses to, but it is hard being strong in front of everyone including the baby. I thought about talking to a professional myself but cant fit it into my time between baby, work, helping parents (while not making them feel like a burden). Sorry for the vent but this is the only place i could go. I tried talking to husband but honestly, he is terrible at comforting. Terrible with words. So the best i get is a hug and a reminder not to drink too much wine. Which i can only have a glass once in a while because of breastfeeding so it feels more like salt in a wound.

Thanks for letting me vent.",2019-06-21 10:15:34

Since then, we've been dealt gut punch after gut punch. Here are some of the things we've done to make his last year+ special. Maybe someone can build off it for their own families, or provide even more ideas.

\- We had a large birthday party (of course, COVID has now made this impossible).

\- My sister and I, and our respective fiances, had a double wedding so dad could be in attendance.

\- We had dad do one of those books that allow someone to record themselves reading it for any future children to listen to.

\- For Father's Day, I had friends, family, neighbors, former classmates, bankers, former teachers, etc. share stories about dad - big and small - that he read and was able to reminisce about. We focused on positive moments in his life and I think it was helpful for him to see how many people shared so many precious moments with him.

\- I wrote him a personal letter, letting him know that while he will be so greatly missed, we will be OK.  I will take care of his wife (my stepmom) to the best of my ability and live my life in a way that would make him proud.

\- We have always been very closed, but neither of us is very into saying ""I love you,"" but we have made sure to say it much more often.

As all of you know, there aren't words that can do the situation justice. But I think doing these things will help ensure there aren't any more regrets than there have to be in the long run. Hopefully this is able to help someone.",2020-08-13 01:57:04

Exactly 6 months into the year. 6 months after the stage 4 diagnosis. It was in his prostate and spread to the lymph system and bones. He fought so hard to the absolute last second. 

It was so peaceful and it happened exactly the way he would have wanted. In his home, hooked up to no machines, with my sister and my mom, the only woman he has ever loved though they have been divorced 20 years, holding his hand. I said my goodbyes and told him I would be in the other room as it happened. I know it happened and I know it’s real. But I still feel like I need someone to make sure. 

I haven’t cried as much as I thought. Going back to his house, the house I was brought home to after I was born and grew up in, was comforting. He was suffering so badly. But I just miss him so much. I know these are normal feelings of grief but I just can not believe he is gone. Talking about it helps for now. I have moments of anger. I just don’t know what to do with myself. 

I’m a daddy’s girl. Always have been. We just understood each other and he was a man that was not understood by many. He was a loner and liked it that way (his words). But he loved his daughters so much. He taught me everything. I am impressed by what I’ve accomplished because he was pushing the bike the whole time once the training wheels were off. He is the most beautiful man I’ve ever know and my last words to him were that I know what I deserve in life and I will never settle, just the way he taught me.

Stairs are an issue which means he's confined to our bedroom upstairs.  It's a nice bedroom with an ensuite, tv, and room to sit in a comfy chair. He has constant company so hes never alone in our room. He has asked to come downstairs and hospice have told him that he is not physically able to and if he attempts he will most likely fall and end up in hospital where he will die. My husband keeps bringing this up and I've been advised to keep distracting him.  His brother keeps on at me about different ways we could get him down the stairs despite professionals telling us it is not a good idea.

I felt empty. I didn’t cry, I tried to speak, I just knew something was wrong. Eventually I lashed out, anger getting the best of me. I wasn’t angry at him nor my father or the nurses taking care of him, I was angry at the world- at myself.

I calmed down and I simply cried. I guess it came in waves, as I was mostly okay at the hospital. It’s hard seeing a parent with oxygen hooked in their nose and a billion contraptions and machines working around him. I didn’t want to be sad in front of him, my father is the closest person to me.

I so badly wanted him to be there to see me in my white dress. I’m only 18, and I’ve never dated anyone before, so it was a bit of a stretch, but we kept hope. Now, I have prom on November 23rd and I’m simply praying that he can see me all dressed up for that special occasion. 

It isn’t fucking fair this happens. I didn’t think it was going to, it seems almost outlandish. I just want to say sorry to him for the times we fought, and the times I was a bratty teenager, or the times I told him I hated him- because I surely didn’t. I love my father, and I hope that there is something after death.",2019-11-15 19:07:32

109,My Dad has been in the ICU since Wednesday and was put on life support yesterday morning.,19,ia5h0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/ia5h0q/my_dad_has_been_in_the_icu_since_wednesday_and/,9,1597518431.0,"This may be a bit long, and I apologize in advance, but I need to get this all out. 

My (30F) father (49) was diagnosed with bladder cancer last June. He has his bladder removed in hopes they caught it in time, but unfortunately it had spread. He's been so strong, a real trooper. He's undergone two types of chemo, radiation, and immunotherapy. I saw it deteriorate my poor father so much, but he fought through it all. He finally was on a chemo that was getting rid of his cancer which is amazing! 

But Wednesday morning came along and my world was flipped upside down. My Dad was supposed to go in for a blood transfusion as he had been feeling quite woozy for the few days prior. (He's no stranger to needing blood transfusions, but he felt a bit more dizzy than usual. Very out of breath too.) When he woke up he was in so much pain, he thought he had a kidney infection or something similar. (He's also no stranger to these as he has an ostomy bag and more susceptible to infections.) When he tried to sit up he said it felt like something ""popped"" inside him, so my Mom called an ambulance and he was rushed in at around 930am. At about 10pm she received a call from him saying that they discovered he has flesh eating disease and was going in for surgery. Since it was on his back they had to remove skin and tissue until they reached healthy tissue, so basically until he started bleeding. My Mother raced down there and saw him before he went in for surgery. The doctor warned them both that with his immune system being so weak, there was a chance he wouldn't make it out of surgery, but my Dad wants to fight it and went for surgery. He made it out, but the infection had spread and they were hesitant about another surgery. We opted for a second one and he thankfully made it through! He is unfortunately very heavily sedated so he cannot respond to us, is on a breathing machine, and an incredible amount of IV's. I still talk to him and tell him I'm there and that I love him though. 

Today I felt like everything came to a halt. My Mother called my brother and I and told us to get to the hospital because we had to help her make some decisions (the day nurses weren't letting more than one person in his room, which is unfortunately why I wasn't already there) with her. The DNR type of decision. She told us that the second wound hasn't stopped bleeding and when they tried to move him to see if they could cauterize it he went into cardiac arrest, so they had to stop and stabilize him. They did. They tried another cauterize procedure shortly after my brother and I got there, and did manage to get some done and keep his BP and heartbeat stable. His hemoglobin levels are still dangerously low and they're trying to keep that stable. Because of all this, he cannot continue with the chemo. The doctor told my Mom that he's not out of the woods yet and there is a possibility he could pass. When we left for the night his levels were still stable, but we were given a pager to take home incase something happens. It's now 5am and I cannot sleep. I just want to be by his side. 

He's still being strong and fighting, and I'm so fucking proud of him. 

I'm just not in a good place right now and need some support. If you read this all, thank you so much.",2020-08-15 19:07:11

Ok. Both granddads died of cancer. Not that old. In fact my fathers father was only 55 when he died. Then my grandmother passed. Cancer. 

In -98 my mom told me why she always was tired. My family didn’t tell me that they found out in -88 that she was ill. She passed in 2002. I was 19 then. It was a bit to early I think. She didn’t even turn 50. Messed me up that that they didn’t tell me sooner. 

I’ve coped kinda ok I think. But I’m a bit numbed. 
My father got a new wife and since then I’m not unwelcome there but idk. Her children seem more important. We, (two men Ofcourse), never really talked about it. And when I’ve tried he starts another conversation. 

Always joked that I’ve had my share of the disease. 

So about a month ago. My wife got an x ray and they found a tumor in her kidney. Big one. 

We got two kids. 10 and 14. 

Things just settled down. Kind of. 
She’s through medical school and I’ve got an ok job. But as you all know just getting through the week with preteens and teens and school and work. It’s a hassle. 

We tried to have it “normal” just until she went to hospital. 

Yesterday she had the op and by what I understand it went well. She’s in pain but seem ok. 

And on top of that it’s the coronathing so we can’t come visit at the hospital. 

Kids are super patient and are seemingly happy. 
But I know that they obviously are sad.  

And I’m here just passing time. I feel nothing and it scares me. 
I know I’m probably gonna break down in the coming days. 
Just hope that it’s not in front of the kids.

Our family is devastated, heartbroken, and cannot think straight.

What is your advice for what I should do with this time? Should I take a leave of absence from work and stay at home during this time? My sister lives with her and has been her primary caregiver. What should we do with the time we do have to make it memorable, pleasant, comfortable, and full of love for my mom? Any and all advice and tips are so appreciated.

Also, shortly after my mom was diagnosed, I found out that I am pregnant. This will be her first grandchild. We told her right away and she was overjoyed. She already crocheted 3 blankets for our little one. Our baby is due in April which happens to be when my mom’s birthday is. We find out the gender in 3 weeks. I had planned to do a gender reveal with the families but now I’m wondering if we should change those plans too. Maybe have my mom go to the ultrasound with me instead?

In 6 months he’s gone from my dad, a big loveable bear of a man, to someone who vaguely resembles a white walker from Game Of Thrones and he now only has a few more months to live. Maybe. 

Doctors have got lazy with this covid stuff and feel like it gave them a excuse to prolong things and gave them a new excuse to fuck things up. After a 9 day stay in hospital myself recently I have seen first hand how relaxed and unbothered doctors are and their total lack of urgency. While in hospital I watched ward nurses blatantly ignore ringing phones while not even busy themselves. This phone was for family to ring to check on loved ones unable to use a phone themselves. I’m wondering if my dads ward is the same. I was also given the wrong meds countless times and they just shrugged. 

It also bothers me that three months ago they were talking about cutting the tumour out and chemo and they still hadn’t done it for whatever reason and now they won’t do it because he’s a dead man walking at this point. They’re just fitting a stent instead.",2020-09-16 13:10:20

And if they did operate, he’s on blood thinners so he’d bleed a lot which is another reason for them not wanting to treat him.

We has been through 3 years of surgery, chemo and radiation and she was discharged from the hospital a few months ago entering hospice care for her final days. On discharge the hospital expected she had a few days to a couple of weeks. That was 3 months ago. 

When we had “one more day”, what to say and do came easier. When we have had 100 “last days”, we have been running out of what to say and do to comfort her. 

We were filling our days with car rides and visiting museums, etc. We have reminisced and taken pictures. Coronavirus has removed our options for going out. Now we are watching filler TV, doing some puzzles and otherwise hanging out. But I have run out of things to say and she has lost interest in the mundane activities we have around the house under quarantine. 

We are not religious; we both believe in oblivion after death. There is no comfort for her regarding an afterlife. There is some anxiety about not having a future, though. 

I have never been the kind of person to say nonsense like “it will all be ok” - and my wife doesn’t take comfort in those kinds of empty things anyway. We have said “I love you” so much that it has lost its meaning, sort of. Not lost it’s meaning, it just goes without saying - it’s not as much comfort in these last days.

We don’t talk about my future. I’ll be “ok” and she knows it and I’m not worried about that. I don’t feel comfortable talking about the future and she doesn’t bring it up either. I have tried to comfort her in talking about how much she has meant to me and all of the things that I love about her, but that sort of stuff is not much of a comfort to someone facing death. 

Each day she wakes up I’m thrilled, but I know it means a day of suffering for her. She’s not lucid some days, semi-present other days.

I still can't believe it. He just came back from his chemo and I went to check up on him and he was unresponsive. My life is a complete and utter mess. I'm trying to keep it together and balance school/work and my mom is just so broken. 

I miss him a lot and I had no idea this would happen to him. There weren't any signs. Just one minute he was fine and the next he was gone. He was very stubborn and refused to get treated until we forced him to get checked out. We only found out he had cancer six weeks ago and now he's dead. 

Sure, him and I had our differences, but I just can't believe it. I've been putting in my all these past six weeks and I barely get any sleep cause I was constantly taking care of him. I just turned 19 a few days ago and I can't help but be sad about not having him with me for the rest of my life. I just had a normal conversation with him and the next thing I know he's dead. I don't know what to do

For those who experienced something similar... how do you cope? Does it actually get easier? And i also just feel a little alone. I want to talk to people other than my family but I can't in conscience just text people I haven't talked to in awhile that my Dad is dead, it just feels selfish and I'd be putting a massive burden on whom I tell it to.

My mum never included me in her ""plans"", she didn't want to upset me. It was Monday, 28th of Remember 2017 at 7pm when my mum and dad called to say she had cancer had come back and it spread. Lungs (explains the cough), liver, pelvis and spine (explains the aching). I was 5 months pregnant at the time and I remember first thinking ""how do I give up this baby so it's stem cells would cure her cancer"", then I cried for three days.

We had her for four more years.

She was mostly just mum during that time, we all but forgot that she was sick and if it wasn't for the dr appointments, the subtle cough that followed us wherever we went, and the shadow of the port on her her tshirt that for the most part was what was keeping her alive.

She read bed time stories for my babies and was there for their birth, she nagged me daily, and she never let it show that she was a time bomb.

Until Monday 6th of April, my sister was due to drive up to see my parents. She couldn't make it until the Tuesday but she too felt the sense of urgency, she knew she had to be there.

That day my mum tried to call me, I told her I was busy at work  and I was sorry. So she sent me a message telling me thank you, and how much she loved me.

When my sister eventually made it there, mum was in her home hospital bed unresponsive, the couldn't feel a pulse. It was there though, just faint. She's taken enough of her painkillers to make her organs start to shut down. She knew what she was doing, she wasn't an idiot. She was a smart, strong woman, who reminded me many a time when I was in my moody teen years that she once took enough pain killers to nearly kill her.

She decided for herself that she was ready to go. She waited for me to get there, but thanks to covid I couldn't be in the hospital. My dad signed over his rights to my sister so she could be in the room. I cried in the carpark under her window for hours. Thinking this was as close as I was ever going to get to my mum again. My best friend, my creator.

It was not without the kindness of the nurses caring for her that when it was time they snuck us onto the ward to be there by her bedside one last time. To hold her hand, tell her we loved her. 10 minutes. These angels gifted us the last 10 minutes of her 4 year fight, 10 minutes I can't imagine what I would be without.

In January she was told she had six months to live— I immediately quit my career to move home a couple states to care for her while trying last resort treatments. She has quickly deteriorated, sleeps 23.5 hours of the day, hasn’t been able to walk to more than the bathroom, and has been losing the light in her eyes. It’s devastating. But this experience is solely to communicate how COVID-19 has effected this situation and to prepare anyone in this situation to work hard as an advocate for their loved one. And let me preface this experience by saying that I DO NOT BLAME OUR HEALTHCARE WORKERS BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IS HORRIBLY OVERWHELMING AND TERRIFYING.

Yesterday, I woke up in the morning, she had a low grade fever, extreme weakness, and was seriously confused. I immediately called her oncologist who told me to take her to the ER which I was beyond nervous to do because of COVID-19. On the way to the hospital she begins hallucinating, cannot communicate effectively, and of course is in terrible pain. I got her to the ER around 10:30am, they took her back and because of the virus wouldn’t allow me back. I tried to explain that she could not effectively communicate with someone and I needed to be able to speak with SOMEONE to go through her normal symptoms and the rapid onset of the new ones. They refused, shuffled me out the door and told me to wait in my car and a nurse would call me. I called around 5 times from my car, and walked in three additional times to try and speak to someone before I finally got a call at 3pm in which they told me that they were giving her a couple bags of blood because her hemoglobin was low (6.4). They were transferring her to the cancer unit and after getting blood she would be discharged. I was still not allowed to speak with anyone or visit (I was speaking with the man solely transporting her to her room).

I immediately began trying to reach her oncologist to explain that her hemoglobin was low.. it is AN issue but it is not THE issue. I talked to a triage nurse at the cancer center, not his triage nurse, who truly was an angel and listened and promised to relay my concerns. She did (thank God someone listened) and called me back to tell me I would get a call from the oncologist as he was in the room evaluating my mother in between 6-8pm.

6pm rolls around. I get a call that my mother has finally begun her first unit of blood. Which might i add, she hasn’t been fed the entire day— i had to call the floor and ask them to please give her some food which they obliged. At 6:45pm I get a call from the oncologist— he tells me I’m correct. That anemia does not cause this type of confusion. It’s either an infection or the cancer has metastasized to her brain. And that he is allowing me to be in the hospital for end of life purposes (again, thank God).

So I was able to get in around 8pm. She has begun on IV antibiotics and gets a CT scan of her brain today. They want to get her out of the hospital as soon as possible regardless because of the virus. It’s a whirlwind. And there is honestly nothing much to do about it but I wanted to put it out there because if anyone is facing a similar situation, i want them to be prepared to fight as hard as you can. Healthcare workers have SO much on their plate right now and things are slipping through the cracks. They are only human. But your human matters too. Be the best advocate that you can be during this time. It is hard and it is scary but they need you more than ever right now.

Earlier today, I had a video call with the two doctors in charge of my mom's care, my brother, my step-sister, my step-dad, and myself. My step-dad is with my mom at the treatment facility, while me, my brother, and my step-sister can't visit them at the moment and we're overall a bit skeptic of the treatment.

All three of us mentioned we weren't discounting the treatment my mom chose to pursue. We all said it is still another valid form of treatment no matter how skeptical we are. During the call the doctors kept talking over us, never letting us finish our sentences. I thought we had valid worries, concerns,  and sentiments. Yet I believe the doctors were rude and being defensive. They wouldn't discuss with us the potential risks or negatives with natural treatment, only highlighting the positives. But then they'd throw conventional treatment under the bus, saying all the negative things about it not highlighting any of the positives. It was extremely biased.

I want to genuinely understand what's going on, but when the doctors are like this, it's very hard to. And then the worst part was, one doctor asked us would we rather see her weak from radiation or not. I DON'T WANT MY MOM TO BE IN THIS SITUATION AT ALL. And even though my brother and I could visit my mom, my step-dad said it was better not to since she was undergoing treatment for long hours during the day. And yet the doctor asked us WHY WE COULDNT IN SUCH AN ACCUSATORY MANNER. ALMOST AS IF HE THINKS WE DONT CARE ABOUT OUR MOM OR WANT TO SEE HER BETTER AND HEALTHY.

For fuck's sake I want to see her healthy and I want her to be cancer free, and I'm not religious but I hope to GOD that this treatment works because I know my mom will NEVER consider conventional treatment, like her mind is set. And because her mind is set, I won't force my views and thoughts onto her about conventional treatment. So I AT LEAST, want to be VISUALLY and FACTUALLY reassured that this treatment is working you know? Like I BELIEVE my mom is already feeling better. I don't doubt the emotional, spiritual, and mental aspect of this treatment. I only doubt the physical which can be reassured with PHYSICAL EVIDENCE. That's all I was asking for and I felt like the doctors' could care less about the feelings of her family you know?

I can't believe the doctors had the GALL to talk over our worries and then QUESTION US WHETHER OR NOT WE'D LIKE TO SEE MY MOM WEAK OR WHY WE COULDNT VISIT WHEN WE WERE ALREADY TOLD NOT TO???

I don't know. I'm just really upset after that video call. I wonder if there are other who felt like their feelings were invalidated by doctors because just FUCK

Edit: I voiced out how I was upset about the video call to my step-dad. All he had to say was that he understands but most doctors don't have bedside manners and to just let it go because staying upset causes cancer. I'm sorry but ?????? I didn't know that doctors got a free pass for being rude. And not to be consciously rude, but at this point anything and everything can cause cancer so I'd rather stay upset than continually have my feelings invalidated???????",2020-10-14 15:42:28
153,The nurse’s hard love today pushed me to be better at supporting my moms wellbeing.,14,j9hxne,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/j9hxne/the_nurses_hard_love_today_pushed_me_to_be_better/,18,1602495739.0,"The physical therapist came in to see my mom who was admitted to the ER today. She’s been severely dizzy for a few days and spent much of the time sleeping, no walks around the block like we used to a week before. No 3 meals a day, either with the start of the new chemo.

Mom and me were about to go out around the block of the lobby on her hospital floor when I first got to her room, but she sat down and said she was too dizzy a few times, so we didn’t.

Then the physical therapist came to evaluate her. They walked about 3 rounds together as the other nurse talked to me about how much encouragement is needed and crucial from family members for the cancer patients. It was emphasized to me that I needed to walk with her and I needed to phrase our walks differently, like, “hey mom let’s go to the store together!” 

At this point I felt so guilty and terrible because I have been saying for a long time that I needed help, and here they were saying, I needed to do this, that I don’t have a choice really. That I need to be the strong link. I explained I’d like more help even a physical therapist to visit once a. Week basically so there are more people mom can interact with. The physical therapist said mom doesn’t need her to walk. She can walk fine, just needs encouragement.

The nurse told me when we eat meals we need to eat together so mom is encouraged to eat. And to make the food look appetizing even if it doesn’t take good to her. To ask her what she likes to eat everyday so I can get or make it for her and strike when she has even the smallest appetite.

I was feeling terrible today because mom was telling me she didn’t want to live again. It’s been hard to keep being optimistic when she says things like that to me—and I know, intellectually, her pain is there—and sometimes I side with her, I think about how we force people to be in pain, and why? Why do I force her to live for me, etc? Aren’t I doing that? Possibly? Then I try to be selfless or switch to a less self-satisfying perspective where I don’t want to lose her, where I feel really unready for that to happen, where I feel absolutely loss and broken, but try to understand her perspective that she doesn’t want to be in pain, none of it, that she doesn’t want to continue like this—and I think about sedation and how to best help her go peacefully when the time comes...

The nurse and physical therapist basically felt that she was depressed and not eating or walking because I wasn’t encouraging enough or spending enough company with her, or eating with her, or encouraging her harder to walk—I started crying because I felt terrible (I usually do when someone tells me I’m doing a poor job at basically anything, it triggers this feeling of worthlessness) and it was happening here—but their talk with me made me refocus. I’ve been trying to say to myself that the pain isn’t about me (I agree and disagree) but if I refocus on my mom then she will eat and she will walk and she will find a reason to live.

It’s all easier said than done. I felt resentful when they pulled me aside to say that. But after a few tears , I walked back into moms room and started up wrapping the food my aunt made for her. I began unwrapping while she was telling me she couldn’t eat because she’ll throw up. And I did my best talking about mundane things like my cat turning 11 and how we used to play ping pong in the porch when I was in 6th grade, the summer we didn’t have internet or tv. I said “mom this soup is so good! And this meat is so tender! You have to try this! It’ll be good for your gut.” And she was eating the congee, and she was eating a few pieces of meat, and by the end of the night she seemed more willing to live, more at peace.

It’s an ebb and flow. It’s hard and then it’s not—it’s hard and then it’s light. Then it feels like everything is okay, no matter the outcome, because we can share some laughs together and smiles while the sun sets outside her hospital room window. 

And I get to walk out that room saying “see you tomorrow! Love you.” Another day.",2020-10-12 09:42:19

155,Living to Die,15,i8s5fe,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/i8s5fe/living_to_die/,4,1597316522.0,"Around April my dad was diagnosed with a very aggressive form of brain cancer, we were told that he would live another 4-6 months. My family decided to keep him home (with no chemo/treatments as it’s pretty much futile at that point) in a hospice program so that he would be able to die in the house he loves surrounded by the family he loves. That being, it’s becoming more and more difficult to look at him. His deterioration is absolutely heartbreaking and I can’t help but cry whenever I see or think of him. He can’t eat, drink, move, see, and his breathing has become more labored and erratic recently and his fingers have started turning purple. He can’t do anything, and since he can no longer take his seizure medication there’s the risk that he can have one at any given moment. It’s like watching a helpless animal die and not being able to do anything about it. You don’t really grasp the concept of death until it’s right in front of you, slowly taking the one you love, and your just watching. 

I’ve never been a good daughter and I know there are many things I should’ve done differently. My dad was an alcoholic most of his life and still was until he got sick. When I was younger (around ~7-8) he got so drunk I couldn’t recognize who he was anymore, which for some reason left a deep scar and I began resenting my dad and any alcohol in general. He didn’t hurt me or anything but something in my young mind clicked saying that that isn’t your dad. The 10 years that followed I was straight cruel towards him. I hate myself for that because he loved me even when I was a bitch. I feel awful that my actual feeling of love and care for him came out when they told us he was going to die. I will undoubtedly live with the biggest regret of life of not being a good daughter. (Sorry if I sound like I’m having myself a pity party I just wanted to get that off my chest, I know this isn’t about me.)

I wish there was a way to euthanize terminally ill people, because no person deserves to live the way my dad and many others live. Just living in anguish, pain, and suffering to die. I hope that my dad’s death comes quicker because that’s the only thing that can stop him from suffering. The day I went to see him at the hospital is seared into my memory. In a very weak voice, he asked me a very coherent question that caught me off guard, “When am I going to get better?”.

Edit: My dad has just passed away, he did so around 3:00 am 8/13. May his soul RIP.",2020-08-13 11:02:02

But I need an outlet and support. In January 2018 I was diagnosed with stage 4 msbc, my torso was riddled with it.  I was very active so I thought all the pain was from slipped discs and the activity around the farm. No, I had broken ribs and my spine looked like Swiss cheese (exactly what the er nurse said).   This put me in a wheel chair, then a walker, after 6 months of that I could finally get around with little help.   With continued treatment and quarterly scans, in February 2020 we find out it’s moved to some lymph nodes and my liver.  This year I had 6 rounds of chemo, lost all my long curly red hair (which was my security blanket and mask). The chemo did kick it out of my liver, but it’s still in some lymph nodes.  I’m still in treatment and the my wbc is so low I really can’t go out without the huge fear of getting sick. In July my hair finally started growing back, which made me very happy. But to get to the point of the reason I’m here....  how do you cope when everyone thinks you’re happy, strong and doing ok?  But inside all you want to do is cry, curl up in the corner and disappear. Because you’re tired of pretending that you’re ok.  I’m not ok. My body hurts all the time, my mind never stops worrying about tomorrow (what if there isn’t one for me?).  I have children and grandchildren and a husband that adores me.   And what do I do, I hide the way I truly feel inside so they don’t worry about me.   I don’t tell them these things because I don’t want them to feel the way I do.  I don’t want to harm myself, just need someone to talk to that understands.",2020-08-10 21:59:57

Lots of catching up, laughter, and cups of tea. 

I know from video chats that he had lost weight but I was taken aback by how he looked in the flesh - though tried not to show him that I was. Saying goodbye was heartbreaking, without being able to hug in these times. He’s been really emotional since having the surgery, the tears in his eyes felt like punctures in my heart.

I wish I could make things better for him.

Today I’m thinking about his journey ahead. He doesn’t look well enough to have chemotherapy, but I know it is the important next step for him due to lymphatic spread. I hope he can put on some more weight and build up more strength beforehand.

Things are likely to get worse before better, but he has such fighting spirit. I’m really proud of him and his determination to get better. He is utterly inspiring and I wish I could put into words how amazing he truly is. 

I love him so much. Happy Father’s Day dad!",2020-06-22 01:05:06

I was 9, and I saw him die - the whole event. I was in traumatic shock and I was not expecting it. My mom held his hand and I watched from a couple feet away with all the EMT in the room. Years later as I was older I came to find out he had pancreatic cancer, and it was a quick diagnosis “you have 3 weeks to live.” Yep were they right. 

I opened up to some people and they did give me their loving support and thoughts and kind (even encouraging words). But what is interesting this came from people that lost a dear loved one and all expressed the same thing: 

“view this as a positive way, you were there to say goodbye.”

“I’m glad I was there one last time” something like that. 

“I wouldn’t say it was the wrong timing” (as I mentioned myself - walking in the event) “I’d say it was the right time. Able to say goodbye, and him being able to see you one last time.” 

“I’m so glad I was there to say goodbye. It was hard.” (Something like that). 

Gosh. These comments to be honest for me and my coping - pissed me off. Gets me triggered. Now, If anyone here finds comfort in that, that is for you and I will respect that and there isn’t anything wrong in that. But for me? It makes me angry - heck I wish I never saw it, it was very very traumatic not understanding what was happening, and seeing him struggle for his breathe and a tear dropping down his face as he said to my mom (last words) “I love you.” There is more to the story, but for other people’s triggers - I will keep out. It’s heart breaking to me to think about what my father must of been thinking in those last moments, and my heart aches for him - that he gets to miss out on life. 

Cancer sucks. Death sucks. 

Just yeah, I really needed to vent this out. I know people are meaning well.. but no, I will not take comfort walking into my father dying and struggling to grasp for air. I don’t understand how anyone would want that in their memory. It’s not a good memory for me. It’s a memory that makes me angry, panic, and upset.

My wife passed last week after 4 long years of trying to survive a stage 4 NPC diagnosis.  During this ordeal I learned that as much as I respected and admired her for the strong and powerful lady that she was, her strength in being able to lift each foot and keep walking down the path of hope, even when hope ran out, through all the pain, fear, doubt, hope/no hope, tears, brief jubilations and always always love, grew each day.  Her example is also what is going to keep me going raising her kids.

But I was her caregiver during all of this and she asked me something that I was never able to answer.  Why do we say “fighting” cancer?  It always bothered her because to her it meant that no matter how hard you worked at getting rid of it, cancer could “win” and you’d be a “loser”.  She rejected that.  And the way I see it, she gained 4 more years with her children after being given scant months.  Cancer didn’t “win”, she didn’t “lose”, but I lack the vocabulary.  She never let cancer define who she was.  She never let anyone define who she was.  She simply was her.  And I miss her greatly as do her kids.

Does anyone have alternative vocabulary to “fighting” cancer?",2020-05-15 15:08:48

She had to go through chemo and a few surgeries and within a year was back to normal, although on many cancer related drugs and her health and hair gone. She is truly the strongest woman I know. Unfortunately, eight months ago she was diagnosed with breast cancer again, stage 3 triple negative metastatic, which is an incurable cancer. I am 15, and taking it pretty hard.

My dad of 53 years was diagnosed with terminal cancer on 11/03/20 and whilst our family are being as supportive as we can he has gone from being able to walk  and drive round freely, to being wheelchair bound and in need of constant care. He is really struggling to come to terms with this, we have created a Facebook for him and got him in contact with old friends which has helped slightly 

Finances are not great and he is in constant worry about leaving us short of money,  He has a pension that was due to finish next year but he won't see next year, unfortunately.

There are a good nights, where our family have a good laugh but when the conversation drops or silence falls for a short while i can see him thinking. I always say 'whats on your mind' so i can share his pain so he's not alone and tonight he just replied 'i just dont want to go, im not ready' to which theres a lot of tears and hugs. He's was scared of the dark as a kid because he beleived that if there was darkness he would not wake up. Now that fear has come back and we have a night light for him which helps a bit but not completely.

I am from the UK just outside of London and becuase he is classed as extremely vulnerable to Covid-19 we have not chanced going outside for a walk yet, also because he has been sleeping so much due to the codeine, morphine etc a walk just hasn't been practical however were ooking to change that.

What I'd ultimately like to know is how i can make this short time I've got with him the most fulfilling and the best quality time that could be given to him. We are making my older brother power of attorney and have slowly started taking control of his finances to alleviate the stress as he can't cancel direct debits let alone call his pension fund without crying. What can i do to make him feel looked after, comfortable. I'd honestly give up my anything from chocolate to my limbs if it would mean  thay he could survive this shitty tumour in his brain.

Not ultra rare but the pleomorphic makes it a bit more rare and aggressive. One good note for us was although it’s aggressive it doesn’t like to move around fast, it stays in situ more often than not. During her initial biopsy the lymph nodes were clear so things didn’t look so bad, seemed to be in situ. 

I am on disability from a work injury and headed toward permanent disability and my work cut my private insurance off just prior to this diagnosis. Whatever I couldn’t afford to have my wife on it anyway. So gonna go bankrupt paying for insurance but I got her covered on a solid insurance plan. I want her to have the best care even if it wipes me out financially.

So it’s been a long few days as her insurance went live April 1st. Bone scan, then mediport placement and CT yesterday and Chemo this morning. This COVID-19 issue stops me from going into most of her stuff including her oncologists this morning. So my wife who already has bad anxiety issues had to hear that this has metastasized to her liver alone. It’s breaking my heart as I am always with her at the dr for anything as she gets very anxious even for routine stuff.

So here I am with my wife sleeping next to me on the bed trying to process all of this. None of it is good news but it’s not the worst news. In the middle I suppose. Good stuff is her bone scan was clear, the liver seems to be a small spot and the dr isn’t changing the treatment course at this time as she is already on a strong, hard hitting path. So we are going with that we are not gonna flip our lids until the Dr gets worried. 

In the end I am at a loss, for 16 years I’ve been her rock, pulled us through some serious crap and for the first time in my life I feel unprepared, lost and don’t know what to do for her. I’m strong with her but break down whenever I’m not near her (shower, out in the yard etc..). Everyone I know says I’m the strongest person they know and here I sit feeling totally broken and helpless.

I don’t know what to do, I don’t want to lose her, I don’t know how to keep strong this time, I don’t know how to fight this one. I’m scared.

If you read this far thank you, I don’t know that there is anything anyone can tell me but hang on, follow the drs orders and fight like hell. But I’ve never been here before so I reach out to this community for support and advice. Thank you all.",2020-04-04 05:53:23

I’ll try to keep it short. 

My mom has been fighting against cancer for 3 1/2 years now. Going through multiple surgeries & treatments, that all stopped showing results after some time. Right now she’s in hospital after having brain surgery because of a large metastasis & has to stay another 10 days for radiotherapy. At this point we are all fully aware, that her time on this earth is very very limited. She’s being strong for a long time and within the last few months her energy & will to live just faded so quickly. 
Naturally all I want to do is spend time with her, which is really difficult right now. The hospital’s guidelines are extremely strickt about visitors & only allow one visitor per day. Still me and my sister tried to visit our mom today. She is underage & couldn’t come to visit, if nobody would drive her. As the virus cases are rapidly increasing right now, we’re afraid it would soon  be impossible to visit her at all. Also I couldn’t handle visiting alone, because im just not emotionally stable enough to be in this environment of illness & death, plus seeing my mom in this condition, all alone. But the hospital staff denied us access together, so only one of us could visit. As my sister couldn’t come there on her own, I told her to go through. I was so sure, that I would have the courage to explain our situation, but I just couldn’t speak. Instead I just ran out & broke down crying. I knew it was absolutely helpless, because the staff was just doing there jobs and helping the greater cause of fighting this virus. I understand and I respect that. 
But still, in all of these years of fighting, I have never felt such pain, as someone telling you right in the face, that you could not be with your dying mom, hold her hand & tell her how much you love her, when she needs you the most.",2020-10-21 23:18:58

I said, shaking, knowing nothing good was coming. ""You don't have RA, bad news, you have stage 4 Osteosarcoma."" I cried, for so long. I was devastated, you never think its going to be you.

The episode is very sad to watch but I feel very helpful. It explains death, life, being, and what it means to have a parent pass away, especially from this disease. Whether it be cancer or not, eventually everyone will have to deal with the pain that we are all dealing with in here.

This episode doesn’t solely apply to those with parents with cancer however I felt that it would resonate greatly with those who are dealing with something similar.

182,Mom in hospice,14,hvaejd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/hvaejd/mom_in_hospice/,5,1595377358.0,"My mom was diagnosed in May 2019 with stage 4 lung cancer after her femur broke due to a lesion on the bone. She had no symptoms aside from the leg pain (which she thought was maybe something with her knee at first). She also had extreme back pain, which eventually lead to a CT scan which also helped diagnose her cancer. She was a smoker back in the 70s, but quit in the early 80s. Not sure if the type she had was due to smoking (she was in denial for most of this and never asked questions or did any sort of research). She had surgery then and was in rehab for the leg, putting any treatment on hold for her lungs. After she got out of the rehab, she started radiation on her leg and started immunotherapy with Keytruda every 3 weeks. 

During this time she had to eventually have a port inserted into her lungs to drain them due to fluid filling up in her lungs. She was constantly uncomfortable as it hurt to lay down, and even if she found a comfortable position, she felt like she couldn’t breathe. Eventually the fluid stopped, which was a relief, and she started getting good news with her scans. 

Fast forward to November when she started getting extreme upper back pain and unbearably tingly arms. She ended up having surgery on her spine due to another lesion causing a fracture in her vertebrae. She never felt relief after the surgery. 

Since about March she has been in extreme pain and her scans showed additional tumors. Her oncologist suggested chemo (which I’m not sure why that wasn’t the first thing he recommended upon diagnosis). She’s always been terrified of chemo and didn’t want to do it. She wanted the opinion of my two sisters and I and we wanted her to do it. She started on it but only made it maybe 4 or 5 times before she was too weak for it. 

End of June, she was in so much pain she was admitted to Rush Hospital in Chicago, where she’s been ever since. No visitors due to COVID of course, but the last time I talked to her was Friday and she was crying and in pain and said the staff told her she should give up (she said those weren’t their actual words but that was the gist of the conversation). I told her not to give up. We hung up abruptly just because it’s hard for her to handle the phone anymore physically. 

On Saturday my sister told me she was moving to an area in the hospital where they were going to work on pain management. By Sunday when my dad and my sister went to see her (I was out of town), she was already unconscious. My sister said she looked like death. 

I came home early from my trip I was on and went to see her. I wasn’t prepared for how she looked. She really does look like the living dead. The nurse said she has “days” and will call us when it’s hours. I just cannot believe this happened and she declined so quickly. On Friday she was talking about how she would be coming home Monday (the 20th). 

I have so much guilt now. I wish we didn’t push her to try chemo, I wish I called her more (albeit whenever I did call, she was sleeping according to my dad). I cant ever forget that last conversation listening to her crying and feeling so helpless. And I won’t ever forget what she looked like when I walked in the room. This is the first time I’ve experienced having a loved one with cancer and I just wasn’t prepared for the toll it takes on a body. She lost over 100 pounds and was unrecognizable. 

Thanks for reading, I just wanted to write it out. I’m surprisingly good about it until I see or talk aloud about her. I’m worried for my dad. He is 84 (she just turned 70 this year), and is not in the best health. He’s on oxygen and is on a walker. He can’t drive or do much. He doesn’t want to go see her anymore after he saw her Sunday. I think he’s beyond shocked because on Saturday he said she was excited to finally get to see them and she never did as she was already unconscious. It makes me sad that he doesn’t want to see her anymore, but I know he’s got his own way of dealing with things. I just pray she goes gently and sooner rather than later. I don’t want to see her like this, but knowing right now she is not in pain is better to take. I just can’t believe I’m never going to see my momma awake again or hear her voice. 

One thing I’m thankful for is in late June, my sisters and I took her wig shopping and she bought a wig that made her smile again and wore it right out of the shop. We had a nice lunch and I know it made her very happy. I can’t believe that was just a month ago. 

The nurse said she can hear people talking to her. Do you believe this to be true? I don’t know how you could know that. I talked to her yesterday but it was very hard.",2020-07-22 00:22:38

Radiation Specialist confirmed that there’s no cancer present anywhere beside the 8cm tumor, only a small spot in a lymph node that is too insignificant to consider concerning.

I am so unbelievably relieved. At this point, he’s looking at 3 months of hardcore chemo/radiation to shrink the tumor and then surgery. 

Every doctor keeps commenting on how healthy he is and that he should be able to withstand this aggressive treatment. (62 yo smoker, used to do a fair bit of hard drugs in his younger years, and definitely doesn’t eat well). I don’t necessarily believe in God but there’s something/someone watching out for him. 

I hope the treatment goes as well as the team thinks, hearing how hopeful he was today was amazing.

For example, one of my friends has lost her mother, brutally she didn't have the chance to say goodbye keeps telling me ""but she's still here, enjoy it, do this and do that etc"" when I tell her how hard it is to see her like this and see her suffer. I don't want to compare, both situations are different but she tends to think she knows everything when she doesn't because she's never been through this. She's lost her mother yes, but I saw my mom suffer, crying, screaming, telling me she couldn't support it anymore and now I see her losing her conscious, her sight etc.
I'm not saying my situation is worse but that it's different and I really can't listen to these ""advice"" people give me like they know what I'm going through..  Just be there for me, listen to me but don't tell me what to do if I didn't ask...

Plus I just say the same things over and over again to try and describe to them the pain that I'm feeling.

And even though thr cancer is better than it was a few months ago, his organs aren’t. 

He has a genetic heart condition and has been in hospital for a lot which has made his many organs weak. Recently, we got to know that he got another heart condition because of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and it’s now at a point where chemo cannot be done anymore. He has Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. Now I know prognosis for this cancer is very very good. 

But, his heart cannot take chemo anymore. His heart has permanent scarring and his aortic valve is hardened and needs to be replaced. We cannot afford the treatment also. His lungs are getting hardened because of radiation. The doctors have given him the time frame of 1 year to 3 years, with still having hope that radiotherapy with immunotherapy can work.

He never wanted to treat his cancer. He would say sometimes to let him go but he still went to all of his treatments. Now, ever since the time was given, he says every morning that he doesn’t want to go to the hospital, which never used to happen before. He just wants to stop. He goes to the hospital only because of me. That’s it, not even for his family anymore. Just me. Because I broke down crying when he told me the time frame. 

I don’t know what to do. I think about how he needs to continue the treatment and maybe he will get better but then I also think about his quality of life post cancer and I don’t think it will be very normal. 

I don’t want to lose him. I cannot imagine my life without him. I’ve known him all my life, we’ve been friends for 10 years and been in a relationship for more than a year and I can’t lose him. But I also don’t want him to suffer. He says that if it was me in his place, he would not be able to lose me either. I don’t think I can live with the decision of letting him die but watching him in pain everyday is so hard. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know. Did anyone else ever had to make that decision? How did you do it?",2020-10-10 17:09:12

I am in the car with my family headed to see my dad. I decided spontaneously after a few weeks of wrestling. I live 13 hours away, I was worried about Covid, costs, work, etc.  Then...

This morning as I walked into work, “Go now!” just overwhelmed me. So I told my husband I was driving up today. And he took off from work. And my principal and his team were like, “We got you!” The students don’t return to the building until next week. So this is the ideal time. I’ve booked a hotel for two nights at surprisingly affordable prices. My husband just put new tires on the car...

All the pieces are there. I just couldn’t see it for overthinking and being rational at a time that doesn’t really call for that. I just couldn’t imagine taking my last breath and remembering that I never held my dad’s hand or kissed his forehead one last time. I want to play old music for him. And watch something hilarious. And his wife is allowing him whatever he wants to eat. Maybe I can tempt him with his favorite bagel combo. 

I know he can’t speak but I pray that I feel his blessing and love. My father and I had a contentious relationship growing up. I never really felt that he loved me but he must, right? Because I love him deeply regardless of the past. And love rarely flows one way.

Thanks for letting me share.",2020-10-02 06:56:49

A massive seizure revealed the tumor. He had brain surgery and underwent radiation and the chemo pill. When I saw him a month after the surgery, you would never know what he’d undergone. I drove up and spent a week taking him to his appointments and eating lunch at his favorite restaurants. He was so alive and his usual self. We were all so hopeful. Some part of the treatment was his undoing. He deteriorated quickly. The last time I saw my father, he was unable to use the restroom by himself. My stepmother who is a nurse by profession became his at home. The trips back and forth to the ER have just gutted her. All of my siblings live around the country: I’m in the South, two sisters in the West, a brother in Hawaii. We’ve flown in to help as we can then Covid hit.

This last visit to the ER will likely be his last. They did an MRI of his torso and the cancer has spread. He has been sent home to be as comfortable as possible until he transitions. I have been for the most part numb for the last year or so. My father was unable to attend my daughter’s wedding, his first grandchild. I was supposed to visit him in March, then the pandemic hit. 

I am so torn. Do I drive up just to hold his hand and listen to music one last time? He doesn’t seem to be coherent anymore. I feel like I have let go months ago. The last coherent visit, I played old music that I remember him listening to: Eurythmics, Stevie Nicks, Commodores, Wham, Sade, Barry White, etc. I would quiz him on who it was. And he dug deep down into his memory searching for clues. Now he can’t talk.

I’m rambling I know but I’m not sure if I take the drive and risk exposing my dad to flu? Cold? Covid? I know he’s dying but I don’t want him to suffer. I also don’t want my stepmother to be stressed by the possibility.

I have accepted the fact that my mother will die.

Until then, I will live my life the way she wants me to. And we will enjoy each other’s company as best we can. Whether that’s sharing ice cream or sharing tears, we will enjoy every second.

She has been so brave and strong for all of us (her immediate family) even though we told her it’s OK to “let go.” She is very stubborn, and I know she is fighting her death; I can’t blame her, I’d probably fight it too...But last night she started developing tremendous pain, like nothing we’ve seen before. She was flailing her legs around and wailing things like “help me,” “ow, ow, ow,” etc. Luckily we had some morphine tablets and some Xanax on hand, and hospice recommended we crush up one of each and put it on the inside of her cheek since she couldn’t swallow a pill in that state. It seemed to help. Today they gave us some liquid morphine with a small plastic syringe so it’d be easier for her to take without risk of choking. But I’m worried because she hasn’t eaten anything at all since yesterday, and has barely had any liquids. She has been asleep for the majority of the day. She wakes up for short periods of time (30 seconds up to a couple minutes) usually when she is in pain. She is not very coherent at all, however there have been a few moments where she does make sense. I know she can hear us talking. She told me she loved me earlier, which was great to hear. We talk to her quietly throughout the day and hold her hand. We also have to get her up a little to change her bed pads and diaper. I’m really scared of how the medicine is affecting her on a completely empty stomach. I’m worried the morphine is causing her death to come quicker, but since she cries out in pain and asks us for help, I know she needs it. I hate that she is suffering. It’s soul shattering to know there is so little we can do to help her. I’m just so confused, and part of me wishes it would just end so she can be at peace and stop struggling.

Then the confusion, the unintelligible responses, the faces she'd make, biting the blanket and the worst were the convulsions.

Eventually the dr sent her to a cancer specialist who told us almost immediately that it was probably cancer but we needed to figure out what type, that was on valentines day. Since they figured out she had stage four non small cell lung cancer. Immediately they started radiation then chemo. The chemo tore her up horribly, then when I took her to her Dr for blood work one day they said her blood pressure and white blood count were way too low so they sent her to the er. The er saw that her heart was arhythmic so they started trying to treat her. Within two days she had several mini strokes, which as it turns out was from clots going to her brain, with the chemo messing her up so bad they couldn't give her much blood thinner so the situation got worse fast. They were set to send her home on palliative care when she suddenly passed away. 

I myself have had 3 surgeries this year one planned the other two not so much. I was in the middle of recovering from back to back surgery when she went into the hospital, was struggling because our stimulus still hadn't came and I've been our of work with no pay for over a month.

I’ve been trying to stay upbeat around him as best as I can. He’s my only sibling and we’ve always been the best of friends. Our parents and his gf are wonderfully supportive and seem to be doing a lot better job at dealing with this than I am. 

I was off the last couple weeks to help out and they all insisted I come back to work this week and I’ll be visiting next weekend to see how he’s doing after he starts treatment tomorrow. I feel so incredibly heartbroken and sad. It’s hard to hold it together and I’m worried about work tomorrow as I’ve got a demanding job in the health care field. I feel selfish even asking how I’m supposed to deal with this when he’s the patient. I have a few wonderful friends (who have always seen me as strong) but otherwise, I’m single with no family here. I feel so alone and anxious. It feels like an out of body experience when I’m in a public place right now. 

I’ve contacted some local counsellors to find someone to talk to but it’s the weekend and I’m struggling to get through this Sunday ahead of me...",2020-03-08 20:39:47

My dad (66yrs) got diagnosed with a glioblastoma 5 months ago and I (F,26) have been taking care of him, together with my mom, since then. he had an operation and the healing part went great considering the diagnosis. he finished his therapy (radio+chemo) a month ago and even before then (3 weeks into therapy) he started to be weaker and weaker. First I thought ""ok its bcuz of the radiation duuh"" but last week we got a confirmation that the ""leftovers"" of the tumor have grown a lot since december. even though i kinda knew, it still hit me, harder then the first time, when I was with him in the hospital for his first check up, thinking ah, he is just getting more and more confused because he is getting old and then boom - fking cancer. anyway, it doesn't look to good. I will talk in two days with his neurosurgeon because the doc at the oncology is a douchebag. just another number in his eyes i think, ya know. 

Now here is the thing, I cant look at him and I hate myself for saying that. My depression has reached the peek I think this week. I just want to hug him and tell him everything will be fine but I just cant...he looks at me with sad eyes, he ain't stupid. he IS one of the most inteligent people I have ever met ...my dad and I never had a great relationship, never like im his princess or he is my daddy...he always put work on first place and then the family, but Im not hating on that, what do I gain from that anyway? i want to spend more time with him, but its hard...he can't talk properly anymore, he is slowly losing the ability to walk, etc...all hospices are full here so atm we get some help from a sister who visits...and he hates that, i can so clearly see that he is fed up and that all he wants to do is to drive his car and play cards with his old friends and make contracts of some business bs idk...im lost, so lost and so scared...i want to make him smile, thats all i want. a sincere smile from my dad, not a pitty smile just to calm me. I never got to meet him and see him fully how he is as a person because he wasn't always home, mostly to nap or to sleep and eat...just work work...so idk what he really loves or what i could do to cheer him a liiiitle bit, just a tiny bit..i owe him that, at the end of the day i respect and love him..I would show him all the pictures of his projects he has done, but im scared that that might depress him even more or that he won't know what i'm showing him...fuck cancer, seriously.

225,Not at 35,14,f6hsng,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/f6hsng/not_at_35/,12,1582176852.0,"""They found a mass in my colon, the doctor says that it's likely cancer.""  The words rang through my ears and I felt everything around me reeling for a moment.  Not at 35.  We have children, two boys who are just aged 6 and 1. Our plan was to have another baby when the youngest went on to pre-k but slowly I felt that dream slip away.  We had been putting off a vacation to Europe to see some of my husband's family there for when the kids are older, because we thought that we'd have the time.  I slowly mulled over a dozen things that we planned to do once our children were older and now....I knew.  I felt it in my gut that it wasn't an early stage.  I can't explain how, I just knew. Two days later we planned an impromptu family outing to have a little quality time before the chaos of appointments,  surgery and chemo began. We never made it, on the way the vomiting began and the loss of blood. 4 days in the hospital and a few appointments later my fears were confirmed, stage 4 cancer.  

I can't explain the dread that I have now.  I am typically the person who sees the bright side of any situation, who doesn't realize that things were really hard until I reflect back on what I've been through.  Now, I don't feel like we have more than a few years with my husband.  It's an overwhelming feeling that doesn't feel in anyway like pessimism but more like a premonition.  I don't dare share this feeling with anyone else and I constantly adopt a brave ""we're going to fight this"" demeanor; I feel guilty though, that I'm not blindly optimistic like my family and friends around us and I have a very deep feeling of dread for what the future holds.  Is this completely crazy?  I keep on thinking of things that we can do as a family to make memories and make the most of our time, I figure that whatever the future holds that at least we will have spent our time wisely.

My time since then has been a mix of guilt about not being around to help more (my family and I live 1800 miles away), worry about how her family (husband and two young daughters) is going to cope with both treatment and (potentially) mourning, and outright sadness about very likely losing my sister and friend.

There were a few months this Summer where treatment seemed to be going well and we got our collective hopes up... but a follow-up scan this Fall revealed growth in some known tumors and several new tumors.

Seeing and talking with her over Thanksgiving (last week), she acknowledged that things are getting/feeling worse week by week.  Which doesn't give me hope that she has much time left.

As someone whose work relies heavily on mental focus and creative thinking, trying to get _anything nontrivial_ done has been a struggle.  Unfortunately, I'm not in a position to _not_ work for the coming weeks/months (especially since I'm going to need that time off for emergency visits as things progress — being thousands of miles away makes this even more logistically difficult).

Folks who have been in a similar situation: how have you reconciled _""loved one is in a terrible condition""_ and _""my own day-to-day life and family need to continue moving forward""_?

It’s too much; too long of a story, too private (I realized as I started typing), so I’m just gonna give the bare bones for now. 

My dad is 67, a few months ago he started acting weird and tried to keep it from my sister (39) and I (26). Between the 2 of us we pieced together that he had cancer in the brain. 

At one point it seemed like he was doing better - he was in the hospital getting treatments, had all these big plans for when he was released... 

But now it’s bad again. He’s staying with my sister, thank God. I’m not in the same state anymore, and don’t have the financial means to take care of him. But he seems worse to me. 

I went there for a week to help her out and to see him, found out from medical papers that she got from his doctor that he doesn’t JUST have it in the brain, no, it’s adenocarcinoma, it started in his LUNGS, and spread to his STOMACH and BRAIN. He’s in stage 4. 

I can’t even think about it without crying tbh. 

My sister is very into holistic methods, so she’s trying whatever she can, trying to get him to eat foods with less sugar both for his diabetes and because she read that it can starve cancer cells. 

He’s stubborn though, he wants to do things HIS way, he feels like he has no freedom. That she’s taking his choices away, even though his choices (like wanting milkshakes and candy bars) may make things worse. 

My sister told me he’s been refusing to eat lately. Anything. That he wants to give up. That he yells at her that he wants freedom and isn’t sick (he definitely is, he slept most of the day, everyday when I was there, got confused easily, moods and temper up and down, is skin and bones from not eating properly for a while). He’s tried to leave her before too, he doesn’t want to stay there but honestly I don’t think he can’t be on his own either. 

I feel like either way he’s going to go, and it’s either gonna be that he’s gonna shut us out and pass away out of sheer stubbornness (not eating I mean, since I don’t know if my sister’s methods are working or not), or he’ll go from the cancer (a guarantee) but doing what he wants, and at least he wouldn’t be shutting us out. 

I just don’t know what to do. 

I haven’t talked to him since I returned home. He doesn’t answer his phone and when I called my sister she doesn’t ask him if he wants to talk to me, so I guess he doesn’t. Idk. Maybe her head is just too filled from the stress. 

I was already stressed before all this, but now it’s just infinitely worse. I’m not even the one handling him on a daily basis or dealing with cancer, and still overwhelmed. It feels selfish. But I just don’t know what to do, for him or her.",2020-08-31 04:15:47

246,Hi,12,hmjibj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/hmjibj/hi/,8,1594108255.0,"Hi I’m new to this just because I wanted a place to vent because I don’t want to annoy my friends by always going in and crying. But my mum was diagnosed in 2013 with breast cancer she recovered and we were living out best life until in March we found out she now has a rare terminal cancer and I have only told a few people who are my closest friends but I just don’t know how to cope I’m crying every night because honestly I’m 17 I can’t live without my mum she is my best friend she is so beautiful and perfect she doesn’t deserve any of this she is keeping her spirits high and just got engaged to my soon to be step dad and are getting married next spring. I just don’t know how I am going to be able to cope once she is gone and it terrifies me because she isn’t going to be at my wedding or meet my children (if I get that far) and I just want to talk to people who don’t know me but can possibly relate.

247,My sister was diagnosed.,11,h9asqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/h9asqn/my_sister_was_diagnosed/,6,1592232345.0,"Story: (We don’t know exactly what type And I don’t want predictions please)

My sister starting in April was having headaches and nausea on and off. It got so bad that she ended up going to a walk in clinic and they said they don’t know why but here are some headache and Amit nausea meds. It got worse and she ended up dehydrated with painful headaches and more nausea. She went to the ER and they  basically said she had a UTI and they couldn’t understand the nausea and just gave antibiotics and anti nausea.

It kept getting worse. She ended up in the ER twice in one day. Sent her home with the same meds. She was even worse that night and started piling up blood and her arm got numb and she was slurring her words. I called 911. Back at the ER...they did a CT and said she has a small brain lesion and that she needs to see a neurologist and get an MRI. The neurologist at that hospital didn’t think it was urgent enough to do an MRI there....and thought that she may be allergic to the nausea meds and changed to different ones.

They barely kept her at the ER just to get rehydrated. 

This was in the midst of corona virus so everything felt increasingly difficult.

Couldn’t get a neurologist because my sister didn’t have insurance. I got her an eye appointment though because maybe she just couldn’t see.

The optometrist she saw noticed her right optic nerve was bleeding and inflamed and sent us to the ER at a different hospital. 

They did an MRI. Found the brain lesion and and nodules and confirmed the optic nerve inflammation and bleeding. 

They did a lumbar puncture to relieve the pressure. She was admitted for 5 days on steroids while they did tests and CT’s and MRI’s to figure out what all of was.

They all seemed to point to Neurosarcoidosis  and also some type of possible inflammatory disorder.

She was feeling better and her right eye healed. She started tapering off her steroids and her head began to ache again. 

Another MRI and 2 days later we get a call that the lesion had grown and that they did an MRI on different parts of her body. She has nodules on her spine and neck. 

They scheduled emergency brain surgery for the day after. The day of surgery the surgeon took me aside and said it was a malignant tumor and thinks it’s possibly lymphoma. 

Only I could be in the hospital. I called my family. We decided to wait until she was more coherent the next day to tell her. The neuro surgeon ended up telling her she had cancer after coming out of the recovery room. Still looopy.

All she could do was close her eyes and keep them closed and put her thumbs up. 

I had to leave and couldn’t stay cuz visiting hours. I felt terrible for leaving. 

Since only once visitor a day. I drove my disabled mom back and fourth and my other sister would take turns visiting the ICU. My father died of Leukemia 11 years ago. So, it’s like reliving another nightmare. 

I droppped my mom off and just got home. When I get a panicked call from her. That I needed to come back. I need to be up there. It’s not good. 

I asked what was wrong and she was so panicked she couldn’t say and she said just get here the nurse said it was okay.

I called my other sister and we both rushed off to the hospital and cried our way in. 

I talked to my mom and sister....the neuro surgeon had updated my mom about stuff that I had already known and his theories of what it could be which sounded aggressive and terminal. 


It really hit hard and was scary and we were all crying. My sister couldn’t get the name. The nurse came in and helped calm us down and they had the oncologist pay a visit to better clarify. I asked what type...what stage etc. 

She said they didn’t know. They have some thoughts but they won’t know for sure because some things don’t fit what that typical cancer would be. She’s very rare. 

samples were sent to the University of San Francisco and University of Washington. She said she’d know the day after.

The house supervisor allowed us all to be in the room when the oncologist came in. We met her and she said we still don’t have answers but good news is that the University of Washington would take her case on. They’re one of the best. 

My sister had been in the hospital for 8 days. Had brain surgery. A shunt placed from her head to her stomach to relieve the pressure of spinal fluid and then they had to re-adjust the shunt again. 3 surgeries. 

She’s finally home today. It was nice and now I’m here with her and it’s been a crazy time. I’ve never really had anxiety attacks but I’ve had so many in the past week or so. I’ve broken down countlessly just crying out of no where.

My family depends on me to be the calm, collective and decisive one. The one that knows and will be there. I’m the oldest sister and my mom has a hard time understanding and getting around. 

My sister that has cancer is 28 years old. The youngest. She is the angel of the whole family. The most generous, giving, loving, nature loving person I know. It She was so set on hiking the Pacific Crest Trail this year. She was ready to head out but because of corona and the headaches it was postponed. She had been saving and training for over a year. It just really hits hard. 

When talking to her she is the most relaxed about it but we know she has her moments. When it’s discussed her answer always is, “It is what it is. I have cancer and all cancer is bad.”

Only once she quickly blurred out her death wishes. 

I can’t imagine my life without her. I’m pretty scared of the appointment we will have with the doctors at UW. 

I don’t know if I believe in God but I never speak of her cancer as a thing that can’t be put into remission. I like to think that I can speak it into existance . That her doctors will say, “She has cancer and if she keeps up with treatment. She will live a long and happy life.”

That’s my story. I do have a loving husband by my side and my mom and middle sister...we are all very close. 


It’s just really hard and painful.",2020-06-15 14:45:45

We want him to be in control of his pain management and care as hospice allows but he thinks it is a death sentence. He gets angry when we bring up the topic and says we are “throwing him out to pasture”. How do we make an old fashioned stubborn man understand that hospice does not mean he’s dying next week and he could be on it for months. It just means he is monitored more closely and has all the pain management he needs. Please help we are desperate.,2020-06-13 04:02:52
249,Feel so alone - rant of feelings not expecting any responses just didn’t know where to post my pain,12,gwqak5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/gwqak5/feel_so_alone_rant_of_feelings_not_expecting_any/,2,1591333746.0,"My Mother has terminal PPC, has had surgery and lots of chemo to prolong and has been through sepsis and ICU stay in Winter 2018-  we thought we were losing her. She was dx in Spring 2018. Bowel obstructions have been her main issue. 
She has had increasing pains, that are thought to be cancer regrowing where it’s been shrunk before and she’s constantly sick and got aches- sometimes she’s alright and until the pain last week was painting walls and what have you.
She’s been shielding for 12 weeks, we haven’t seen her for 14. I had my first baby in January so she could be a Nan and I could have her around. Then covid hit and has taken so much precious time I’m utterly crushed inside. She’s met her twice in four months of her little life. We live too far for window waving and she got to the point it would break her heart to see us so far away. 

So she’s been moved to a hospice from hospital to symptom manage, hopefully for three weeks or less. She can’t manage at home. Oncologist has reluctantly agreed to a regime of Caelyx- if she can overcome this breakthrough pain.

I’m utterly heartbroken. She is a single parent, no other family. My sister is 18 and lives with her and the dog, and our other sister is 25 (doesn’t really make any effort and hasn’t since diagnosis to spend any time with her, despite nearly losing her and being begged by our Mum to spend some time together-). 18 yo doesn’t have a dad or other family she will be left alone.
Mine and our useless sisters Dad has helped a bit but through me texting and asking as he lives a few miles away.
His family is what I thought my family too. But my siblings haven’t even been in touch to ask how I am or any of us. In fact they’ve never bothered since Mum was diagnosed. Anyone will tell you ive tried loads. They have stayed at mine  and I always make effort. Never anything back. Self absorbed teens. My baby girl has come along and still nothing. Annoyed I wouldn’t allow photos on IG because clearly, my baby is all about their attention. My baby hasn’t been well on a few occasions and no one has been in touch. Now this is happening and I feel alone.
I have my Oh for support. We are executors of the Will and from the beginning I’ve had to do everything and face the realities, fight for her to remain on ventilation in ICU. I’m in oncology meetings, as a support. It’s as if people see me as some robot who isn’t allowed emotions.
Of us three girls I am closest to her. 
She loves her granddaughter and it’s painful to see her so sore and so sad on FaceTime.

Today my sisters were awful on Twitter- radio silence for months as usual (until they want somewhere to stay for a concert etc then they’re in touch as I live in a big city.) 

I don’t know why. This whole BLM movement is amazing but they’ve gone from not caring about anyone but themselves to performist activism and I feel like screaming “hello your eldest sister is lonely and sad in lockdown miles away with a new baby and mother in hospice?” So because I RT someone’s (fair) comment about social distancing not being honoured at protests and how this is upsetting those who are shielding and are frightened. A second spike will inevitably mean we can’t say goodbye or hold her. If we can’t see her and she passes in that hospice I might never recover from that pain.
I retweeted, I have no comment on the BLM I’m not fighting for that I can’t see beyond my day with my baby girl and this situation. 
She is 16 and commented a nasty comment, as if I didn’t care about the cause.
Now five minutes ago these teenagers couldn’t give a damn and had no idea or maturity to understand the gravity of institutional racism. It’s insulting to imply I don’t. The movement is happening- you can still see how social distancing being broken is a concern for people like us who will pay the ultimate price of not seeing shielded relatives.
I’m so upset I didn’t response and the other two siblings liked it. I deleted my twitter.
I already feel so lonely in this. I’ve been abused emotionally throughout this by one of my sisters.
It’s a mess. Friends don’t want to know. They text at first, offered a zoom chat today and i just wanted a friendly chat and said so, to take my mind off my sadness. No replies when I pushed. They’re bored of my depressing situation.
I put my baby down on Sunday with my partner and walked out. I was close to walking out in front of a bus. The thought of my baby brought me back round.
I can’t have these feelings aloud- My OH is amazing and if it wasn’t for him I wouldn’t have made it this far. His family don’t really ask after me or our baby, feels like they’re only interested in when she’s older or something. Not in her baby years it’s pretty irritating. They don’t ask my OH how he is coping. Now my own siblings who never cared before are actively against me? When all my life I’ve given up a lot, to spend time with them. Now they’re old enough to be rude they just are with no respect.
I feel very alone. I don’t know what to do. I will be taking up counselling this time to cope as it’s not fair on my baby but I know I’ll be left to pick up the pieces. 
I think the fact I’m so hurt, I feel sick with the pain inside. I’ve lost four pounds this week in weight. 

I don’t expect any replies. I need to get this off my chest, and just say how sad and frightened and bitter I am

I am hoping she gets out of there. But I’ve little optimism left when I’ve seen how vulgar people who you expect to support you actually are. Just no communication.

Now she’s not in a place where she can talk, she’s in the icu and is just barely starting to be conscious again after surgery and complications.

He did not go peacefully. I was not there. I feel guilty. 


The only moment I really cried was when he was already dead. I was afraid to touch him, but I did it anyway. The panic and pain came over me like a wave. I started hyperventilating, and almost passed out. 


During the funeral I was only comforting my mother. She leans heavily on me for support. No one else sat beside her or comforted her. I had to do it alone. He already had children, and their partners, we are close with, whom could have sat around her with me.

This is particularly messed up for me because as I kid I had to take care of her. She was depressed and I was her caregiver.

It kept regrowing, he defeated it and it grew back again.  and this time it spreaded so quick that we are still in shock. It's happening. He started to be really weak and detoriate since xmas and i was not able to care for him at home anymore in terms of physical support, so we admitted him in on sunday. He was still alright, not at his best until wednesday when he complained of massive headaches. He vomitted twice during the night. In the morning, I tried to wake him up for his daily medication, he was only able to open his eyes to see me 1nlast time and went back to deep sleep.  He became unresponsive on thursday, was brought down to ICU. Doctors suspected it was either internal bleeding or the tumour surpressing on the nerve. He registered to be organ donor so they are in process of finalising it and will romove the tubes out on sunday.

I thought I'd prepared for this, and that I wouldnt be too bad but it's really hard to see him with breathing tubes and all other tubes around him. And he doesnt respond to me but he looks so peaceful in his sleep. We talk to him a lot hopong he could hear us. I'm glad that his massive group of friends get to come and say goodbye to him for the last time. 

I'm just really dissapointed that it happened so quick that we didn't have chance to do all the videos he wished to have in his funeral.

I love him so much and I'd never ever leave him.

It’s almost 50% of our check. She never signed up for individual insurance either. Open enrollment here in Illinois just ended few days ago...

She’s normally a bubbly , go get them person here at work. In the last 72 hours, she’s given up all hope of life. 2 days ago was an x-ray for a slip and fall. Yesterday evening was a scheduled biopsy. This morning, they called her back in to confirm cancer (she hasn’t said which one, but from her x-rays it looks to be lung with a growth a little bigger than a golf ball on her lower left lung) She has no family (her husband and son were killed in a accident 10 years ago and parents long deceased) We’re trying to be there, but she’s already made her life into a transaction. (I don’t have the money so I might as well just die. There’s nothing out there for anyone to help me. I’m already dead, might as well just work till it’s over-direct quotes this morning)

We want to show her there’s hope and this isn’t the end, but don’t know where to even begin. You google things and you get ads and half infos. I’m hoping reaching out to you all here could help try to find that hope. Are there ways to get her on the insurance to get the treatment she needs? Are there resources she can go to? Groups she can lean on for support and hope? 

I’ve never had to deal with anything of this magnitude in my life. I’m normally good at finding hope in dark places, but even I have a sinking feeling. Anything you all can offer to point her in the right direction is huge. Thank you  all so much.

Update: Adenocarcinoma Stage 3A was her precise diagnosis. We had a long conversation about it and we’ll be keeping her distracted at work to keep her mind busy as much as possible. So far, there’s some options she’s been offered but doesn’t want to take the advise of the doctors. I am working behind the scenes to see if there is anything else that can be done. A doctor friend is reaching out to see what they can suggest since this isn’t his area of expertise. In our conversations she is lacking hope cuz she has no one.

She has agreed to an aggressive treatment plan and for that I'm incredibly grateful. Mom has always had a sharp tongue and I've always been able to ignore her or talk her down. Ever since her diagnosis she's turned into a viper. I'm her only child and the only one transporting her to her doctor's appointments, chemo, running to get her prescriptions, making sure she has food...you name it. It's all on me because she has driven off every other family member. They don't call her, they call me for updates. They have tried to call her, but she either hangs up on them or won't answer. Her mother called me in tears last night wondering why she won't answer her calls.

I fully recognize she is scared to death and that she's in pain. I know she's frustrated she can't care for herself like she always has, she can't work, she's strapped to an oxygen tank. It's the holidays and she wants to go shopping and she can't. She hate's being constantly poked, prodded and asked the same questions over and over. That her life has changed dramatically. I don't blame her for being upset. It's a perfectly natural response. But she is lashing out at me worse than ever before and she's starting to make a scene at her appointments. And I have calmly asked her to please stop yelling at her care team and me. (And bless them for their patience they have with her.) I have tried to be firm with her and have a rational conversation about her behavior. Today I finally decided to stand my ground and that I was not going to be yelled at any longer. I told her she's going to run off the only person left in her life that cares enough to help. Of course she screamed that I obviously do not care, I am treating her horribly and proceeded to call me a liar...and I can't get over it. She's never screamed at me the way she did today. She's never said such hurtful things to me. And today was the first day I dropped her off for her infusion and left. I asked the nurse to call me when it was close to time so I could pick her up. Now I suspect I'll get yelled at on the way home that I abandoned her. 

Mom was placed on an antidepressant and honestly I'm not sure it's working. The social team is trying to encourage her to consider counseling. She won't. She is criticizing everything I'm trying to do for her. I'm trying not to be overbearing. I even asked her to tell me if she thought I was around too much, because I know there are some days during this process she just wants to be alone. I'm trying to look to see what I can adjust in the way I'm involved in this. I can't just remove myself, and I'm trying to not let the screaming and cursing get to me. 

I have asked her social about caregiver support and she's going to provide some info for me. I'm just at a bit of a loss on how to calm her down and how to steel myself against her nastiness. Or even if that's what I should do.

My 33 year old wife was just diagnosed with a grade 3 tumor in her breast, luckily we got it fairly quick, its 3.6cm, and the lymph node that was biopsied came back clean. 

Unfortunately the tumor they thought was DCIS is actually invasive. Shes doing well, but I worry so much. After her biopsy,  she couldnt lift our kids for 2 days (2, and 11months), and I could see it was breaking her heart not being able to pick them up for hugs. I worry what limitations the treatment will have, and her emotional response.

It was just so rapid, from planning on trying for a third kid, which we wanted, to now being told we would need to save eggs if we wanted to try in the future. 

I am so grateful our kids are so young and won't understand what's happening. 

Today was the day we got biopsy results, Friday we meet with a surgeon. I am looking forward to hearing the plan. Other than being supportive and doing more of the housework,  I dont know what I can do to help her get through this.",2019-10-31 06:28:16

He was frustrated about the slow healing and pain and eager to get back to his job.

I thought nothing of it. He was a tank of a man who had injured himself many times over the years, broken his C1 vertebrae in a bike accident, been thrown through a pane glass window by a drunk on a train platform as a cop, and he would be back on his feet soon enough. We exchanged funny Facebook posts 200 km apart, as always, and I went on with my life.

Last week, after going for a follow up about the apparent damage to his body and pain, he suddenly collapsed and was rushed to the closest hospital unable to speak or walk.

Through my mom I learned they suspected it was initially undiagnosed bone cancer. I immediately went to see him and witnessed a drugged up semi-lucid skeleton of the man I had  looked up to as my ever present tower of strength for most of my life. He was in agony, moaning and flailing, and the weary and pained look on his shallow face and sunken cheeks will haunt me for the rest of my life, as well as the shaggy greying beard that I had never seen on his clean shaven face. He looked old, pathetic, sickly. He had a catheter in and was wearing a diaper under his gown, the kind of humiliation he would have been horrified by.

Over the course of a few hours he would fade in and out of awareness, mumbling nonsense and giving me a few scarce moments of clarity. He began sobbing when he saw me, and I could see fear and regret in his eyes.

The attending doctor told me that his kidneys were in danger of failing due to high calcium, and their immediate concern was to control this before running a battery of tests. The confused mental state was part drugs and part a body’s normal reaction to the problems. I broke down and cried next to him while he rested in a drug induced haze.

I said my goodbye, which thank God was returned with an “I love you too” and a warm hug with a familiar embrace. Those will be my dad’s last spoken words to me and I am thankful.

I went back to work the following day and tried to continue on like nothing was wrong, against a slew of second hand information and family bullshit about how everything was going to be fine. My gut told me it wasn’t going to be okay. I prepared myself for the worst. I was right.

On Friday morning I got the call. All the tests had come back definitively. It was lung cancer that had remained undiagnosed for some time and had spread throughout his body, including the brain. No treatment was possible. It was fatal. He had at most hours or days to live. He was in palliative care. I needed to come and say goodbye.

I left work and waited for my wife to get home. I was in no shape to drive. We drove and hour and a half in dreadful small talk, trying not to talk about what we knew was coming. Fake laughter, music. My dad was dying.

When we got there, I was greeted by an outrageous family reunion. A feuding Aunt who hated my dad, another Aunt I hadn’t seen for almost 20 years, her family, and my mom. Of course, I thought, all the worms crawl out for this.

My dad was in a state that broke my heart. His eyes unfocused, his body withered and showing bloody rashes all over. Unable to speak or move under his own power. Unable to breathe on his own and hooked up to air. This was a military man who once slashed his hand open while fixing a broken down car on the middle of a freezing highway and merely cursed about it after wrapping a rag around his bloody palm. The man who taught me work ethic, strength, and dedication. That life wasn’t all flowers and fun, but it wasn’t as bad as you thought it was. I asked for time alone.

My wife and I sat in the room, the feel of death’s hand hanging over everything, I felt this lump in my throat. He might have been out of it, I have no way of knowing, but I told him how fucking proud I was to have him as my dad, how much he had steered my life for the better, and how our many fights over the years were forgiven. I told him we’d be ok. That it was ok to go and I’d see him again.

We stayed a while longer amidst drama and “here, I want you to have this” and “you need to do this” and awkward fake laughter and stories.

I went home that night and found up out he had died an hour after we had left. Part of me thinks he was waiting for me, but who knows.

Now I’m left with a mother who wasn’t there for me and a squabbling petty family. Not one phone call to ask how I am, my work friends have shown me more compassion and basic human decency than my blood.

I am thankful he knew my kids. I am thankful I said goodbye. I am enraged by the drama and upset my family is causing. I’m staying as much in my own world with the people I care about than theirs, I am celebrating the man who made me what I am, and feeling the loss of his steady hand and sarcastic sense of humour.

I look to my own children and prey they will never know the pain I just went through.

I’m going on with my own life. It’s what he would have wanted.",2018-10-22 03:47:11

I just got back from my stepdad’s doctors appointment (I drove), and was told that he only has 2-3 weeks left to live. He’s my stepdad but he’s been in my life since I was 3. He was diagnosed with stage 4 bile duct cancer at the beginning of April, which was really hard since I couldn’t see him but I since moved back home to be here and help my mom. I’m really struggling with the thought of him dying, we had a scare last week and he went to the hospital but we were told the tumors had shrunk so I guess I got my hopes up a little that he was going to last into the new year. He’s not dying from the cancer, but from the complications, he’s had a very hard life medically and his body seems to be giving up. I’m not really sure why I’m telling strangers on the internet this, but I don’t have a ton of friends and feel bad burdening them with the news, especially since they have no idea how to react and it always turns awkward. I’m only 27 and have never lost someone close to me before. I hate the fact that he’s never going to see me succeed in life, I’m currently unemployed due to covid, not in a relationship etc. I’ve always dreamed of him walking me down the aisle as I’m estranged from my bio dad and to think of a future without any of that or him scares me.

He successfully went into remission and got his transplant only to have the cancer come back a few months later. 

Yesterday, he told me that his white blood cell count has spiked and in the 110 range. He doesnt want to take the medicine anymore as it is causing mouth sores and he has no joy in life. His doctor has told him he only has 2-3 weeks left.

It sucks the life right out of its victims, but she fought so hard all the way to the end. This time last year doctors predicted she had 3 months left, and she kicked its ass for a whole year. She got to have one more go around of every holiday, birthday, and anniversary with the family. One more year of treasured memories for us all. 

The past 4 months were gruelling, painful, bedridden, but she was happy to be surrounded by family all the time.

She used to be quiet and reserved, until one day she realized nobody was in charge of her anymore, from then on everything was about having fun with the grandkids. She quit smoking, played beer pong, tried weed, sang, danced, and gave life all she had to offer. Right now it’s difficult to look back on the fun memories of family vacations, holiday celebrations, crazy superstitious traditions, and to separate them from the painful image of the frail sick woman in bed. But I’m glad my family got to have as much time as we did.

I can’t possibly imagine how my grandpa must be feeling. Losing the person you chose to spend your whole life with, losing your best friend in the world. Watching their health deteriorate for a year, never knowing which kiss goodnight will be the last. Heartbreaking.

I think we can all agree cancer is a vile disease that has taken the lives of too many lovely people out there...
My name is Hailee and I’m a cancer survivor. March 16, 2021 will mark one decade of remission for me, and I thank the stars every day. 
I’ve come here on recommendation of my boyfriend to tell you a bit about my story...
I was 14 when I was diagnosed with aggressive osteogenic sarcoma, and my life was flipped on its head.
Going through the hardest year of my life, I made a lot of deep realizations about myself and the Illness. I had started writing prose pieces that gave people some insight into my life as a teenage cancer patient, and little tricks I used to get by.
A few years after completing chemotherapy, my mother and I decided to combine our minds to bring a book to you, that we hope can touch the lives of someone in need of it.
You’ll find chapters from both patient and caretaker perspectives, with tips at the end of each segment. Tips for patients, caretakers, and friendly people who aren’t sure how to lend a hand.
I felt weird about making this post initially because I didn’t want it to seem like a huge “look at me” ordeal... I just kind of wish I had something like this when I was going through it . The only reason we made the book was to hopefully help a family who needs it like ours did, and if I don’t tell people it’s out there no one will know.
If you are interested in reading more about our story and how we tried to make the impossible possible every day, follow us on social media, or grab a copy for you or someone you care about! 
Thank you for you time and much love!

EDIT: 5% of all proceeds go to The Rainbow Connection,  pretty much the equivalent to make a wish but only centered in Michigan.

Just need to talk this one out.,10,i9i49z,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/i9i49z/my_19f_dad_58m_has_been_diagnosed_with_stage_4/,12,1597421852.0,"My family’s a small but nuclear unit in terms of chaos. My brother (27) and I have absolutely minimal contact with my mother, who is still “with” (lol) my father, and has my 12 year old sister with her. Mum and I didn’t speak for four years as she’s an abusive alcoholic to a Tee. My dad came down with symptoms last July, and got very ill in September. I cut contact with him for three months over other issues, but begged him to see a doctor. When we started talking again he hadn’t, and it was all worsening and spreading in terms of symptoms. That was December. I had a terrible nightmare of waking up this xmas with him dead and no family there. (I rarely have nightmares and when I do, they’re always prophetic and true, my family and friends really worry when I say I’ve had a nightmare). 
So I moved back home despite our really rocky relationship at the time, because my gut sensed things were off. 

Skip forward another 6 months of me and my brother begging him to see a doctor. We got told it was probably non Hodgkin’s lymphoma end of June. Then by mid July it was oesophageal. Now we know it’s tonsils, which has spread to lymph nodes, oesophagus and possibly brain/lungs/stomach (waiting for confirmation). One of the tumours somewhere in his neck was 10cm in mid July. I dread to think what it will be by the time the nhs start his treatment.

We’re still waiting on the final confirmations on everything diagnosis wise, but it really doesn’t look great. My dads superman, he’s never smoked a cigarette, touched a drug, he goes years at a time without a drink, and has exercised 2 hours a day every day since he was a teenager. He’s a world record holding bodybuilder, if there was a real life superman it would be him. He’s always refused painkillers, begrudges antibiotics and cried about having to have sedation for a double hip replacement. 

And yet, he’s not even into the woods, and he’s already the skinniest palest, most lifeless I’ve ever seen him. My brother is his primary caregiver as he works from the family home, whereas I travel for work extensively so I’m rarely home for more than 2/3 day’s at a time.  I want to be there as much as I can be, but I also know that my dad has expressly said he wants my brother to be there more, not me, not my mum. I need to respect that too I think.

Anyway, I just really need some words of wisdom, understanding. Anything. All the friends I have who had parents with cancer are parent less by 20. And there’s a few. I’m incredibly prepared for that situation, not that you ever really can be. But moreover, I need advice, it’s the first cancer case in 6+ generations on both sides of the family and the first seriously ill adult in my family in my lifetime.

There were people from all walks of life, genders, ages and race. And for once.... race didn’t matter. We were all in one place on common ground. Because we were all bonded by one thing...the fight against Cancer. 

When we talked it was no bad vibes.  You don't feel like anyone thought they were better than the other or because you was white and I was black. When my daughter was at the Benson Center I was on a mental and emotional roller coaster. Daily I met and conversed with many people. Nightly I ate with different families, so you know the food was different everytime lol. But I did learn that eating vegan ain’t so bad. In every verbal or nonverbal encounter the feeling was always mutual. We knew each other was scared, fearful, tired, cried out with no sense of direction. 

I felt good hugging other mothers and sharing my fears, tears and hugs with them. I opened up on Facebook cancer groups and I learned so much. Because no matter how far fetch it seemed.... somebody somewhere went thru it before me or they read something about it or just a simple word of encouragement.  I just want to let someone know today that we are praying for you. Regardsless to what the bottom line is don’t give up. Live life to the fullest everyday. If you can't walk or talk... you can laugh. You can think happy thoughts. Choose happiness, laughter and peace. Dont worry about what you can't change and what's done. I’m talking to the care giver also, hang in there you are much loved and appreciated 🛎❤️",2020-08-14 08:24:43

I’m an only child on my moms side. On top of everything, she is also going through a divorce, which started a month after she was diagnosed. Her, hopefully, soon to be ex-husband, is a greedy POS. They signed a prenupt before marriage and yet he’s fighting it. I have some family in town, but I am basically my mothers sole care giver. On top of caring for her, I work full-time, am a part-time grad student, and have the overwhelming stress of balancing the fact that I don’t know how much longer we have together (although I am very optimistic, but also a realist) but also the impending stress that would ensue with dealing with assets/will/last requests, etc. 

To be honest, at this point, fuck money. I make a decent pay check but I’d give it all up every month to get my mom whatever her hearts desire, and I have. I’d sell everything I own to ease her pain and make the cancer disappear. I just want to know, what am I to expect? Do things get better? I know what hurts her more than anything is not the fact that she has cancer, its that she’s faced with the fact that life is terminal earlier than most and that she is going to worry about not being there for me, as all mothers would.

285,I love my mom but her cancer made her so much more reliant on me and its killing me inside.,11,htadbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/htadbi/i_love_my_mom_but_her_cancer_made_her_so_much/,4,1595074055.0,"Let me start out by saying that I never had a great relationship with my mom. She was always tough on me. My older sister was catered to and this isn't just a point of view, it's a fact that shes admitted and apologized for. It isn't to say she never did things for me but she is not even a polite person, shes likeable and personable but she isn't polite and this last year we both have fought a lot and luckily a lot of mental/emotional healing has happened. 

I'm a female in my mid 20's, my mom was diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer after she already went through surgery and chemo for Stage 2 the year prior. 

I moved away from her when I was 17 and I'd been living alone for 3 years up until last year. Before the chemo she treated me basically like a personal slave, she'd yell at me for not cleaning enough, not helping her with things that I didn't know I had to and for when I set up clear boundaries. I'm expected to be her shauffer because she hates driving and is terrified. 

She has nerve damage from the chemo, my sister causes unnecessary stress and berates my mom so basically any and all care is on me. My mom can barely feel her hands and feet and although the chemo has stopped, it seems that the nerve damage is not improving (she says its worse.) She can't cook because she drops everything, she can't drive even if she wanted to now, she can't open anything, she can't cut her own nails, she can barely even grasp a fork. 

I'm trying to be positive but we live together because someone has to look after her right now. It's like having a toddler, she calls my name upwards of 10 times a day because of course theres chemo brain and she can't remember enough for me to do something for her while I'm right in front of her. 

I feel horrible for complaining because I know I'm lucky and shes lucky shes still here. Shes always been a source of pain for me though and I feel like i might end up being her primary caretaker for the rest of her life, that her nerve damage may never get better, that she will likely get early onset dementia because shes too stubborn to listen to me about exercising her brain. It feels like even if I leave her, i don't know if anyone else will help because she's single and my sister can be so difficult. I feel incredibly selfish, guilty and hopeless. 

As much as I worry about her future, I worry about mine. My life has barely begun and I'm worried that I'm going to get increasingly negative and become someone who never dates again because I am living with my mom and it sounds weird but I am actually doing it because she literally needs me to care for her. The amount of assistance she needs wouldn't qualify for a home care aide either. I think I'm overwhelmed mostly because I've never had children and I haven't had a long term relationship for several years. I just am so used to the independence and now I don't know what life looks like or what I look like to others looking in. 

I'm sorry to vent, if anyone has any kind and positive words right now I'd appreciate it. Thanks for reading this far.

Edit: to clarify she is thought to be cancer free now and we are just waiting for official remission. Her nerve damage and stubbornness is why I feel I may care for her for the rest of her life.",2020-07-18 12:07:35

It has been a huge help and massively reassuring to read the stories of others who have been impacted by this horrible fucking illness.

Last night, after the bravest battle, my beautiful dad passed away. We held him tight and told him how much we all loved him. We had his playlist on shuffle and shortly after he went, Space Oddity by David Bowie played. 

""Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles,  
I'm feeling very still.  
And I think my spaceship knows what I must do,  
And I think my life on Earth is nearly through""

Bowie is one of my favourite artists. The fact this song played was both heartbreaking and heartwarming all at the same time. He told me he wanted me to have a baby a few months ago. We have always said that when we have a child, they shall be called Bowie. It was so strange that this was the first song we heard after he passed. 

He was the best person. I was his first of three daughters and he called me ""number one"". He was my number one too. Our song was ""Suddenly"" by Billy Ocean because it was the first song he heard when I was born. He added the lyrics to the speech he gave at my wedding and we danced to it on my 30th birthday.

I am going to miss him beyond measure.

I apologise for rambling, I just needed to vent.

She had as much of the chemo treatments as her body allowed but on checkup, they found it had spread AT LEAST through the bladder wall.  A few weeks ago she had her bladder removed and they took a piece of lung tissue to be biopsied as they thought it may have spread.  It came back positive, so now it is stage 4. BUT then this past week, she went back to the hospital due to a blockage in the small intestine which ended up requiring another small surgery. Now, she has not been in contact for a couple of days, or online at all. I am currently unable to call to check up on her as I am having my phone replaced. She is home, amid a plague of sorts with her husband Tom who also may have cancer and if either of them gets this virus both of them are likely dead. 

I guess I just needed to tell someone because the likelihood that I will never see my mom again has hit me hard and I am finding it very difficult in combination with the mental illness I already deal with that is making it so so so much worse.  I hope I do not sound like I am whining about stuff or overreacting.......

UPDATE: So I am sorry for not replying to anyone, I have just been trying to function. My mom messaged me on FB Messenger and had been ill for a couple of days after the surgery for her blockage.  She is in the hospital still as far as I know but should be sent home soon. I feel like it is still likely I will never have the chance to see her again, but at least I know what is going on.

The reason for that is love, like a lot of times. Anyways, my family has always only been my mum, grandmother and my two uncles. Back in 2015 me, my fiancé and son moved to England together after living in Sweden for 3 years. Back then my mum and my uncles had started to fall out with each other, it wasn’t that bad back then but ever since it has gotten worse and worse. I have always talked to my mum daily during all the years, and I have tried to call once in a blue moon to my uncles and grandmother as well. Sending cards etc just to let them know that I do care about them, miss them and love them all. They have never really tried to put an effort to talk to me though. The thing is that my mums and her brothers problems put me in the middle, but no one seemed to care. They just kept fighting (without even talking to each other) 

Today I found out by my mum that my grandmother passed away. She found out by a family friend, and that friend found out from my uncles. I was last in the line...and I feel so upset about it. Apparently she has been in hospice care since two months back, and they didn’t even let me know that. If they did I would have hd the chance to take my son, fly over, and see her for a last time.

I received the devastating news today that my Mum has a tumour on her kidney and also a pathological pelvic fracture as there is a lesion in the bone. Not sure if the 2 are related or 2 separate things. 

Mum and I shed many tears as I read through the results, and after she and my Dad left, I just sobbed uncontrollably to the point where I almost threw up. I’m a mess. 

It hurts my heart. My Mum is the greatest woman I know. To know that this is happening to her just destroys me. I’m torn between not wanting to wish precious time away but also wanting to know where we’re at - is this treatable? Can this be fixed? I’ve been googling which is the worst thing I can do and also useless because depending on the stage, the prognosis differs greatly. 

My partner has been great. He asked me earlier what I needed - do I need time alone? Do I want him to sit with me? I was just ‘I don’t know. I don’t know what I need’. I just don’t know what to do. I just feel so helpless and useless. I feel like I need to be doing *something*, I just don’t know what. 

I know I need to pull myself together and be strong for my Mum (& my Dad who is really devastated by the news), just like she has been for my whole life. I flit between ‘it will all be fine’ to ‘I can’t know that it will all be fine’. My emotions are all over the place. I just need advice from people who have been there: how do I remain strong? How do I put on a brave face? How does life continue as normal - how do I go to work tomorrow and act like everything’s fine when my whole world has been turned upside down? I do feel that being around my workmates will help because work is like therapy sometimes, and if I stayed at home I’d just sit here and torture myself with the what ifs.

I just keep hoping I will wake up and this will have all been a bad dream. I feel absolutely burnt out by the shock and sadness. I wish I could fix it. I wish I could go through it for her.",2020-02-17 20:11:09

My dad was recently diagnosed with Glioblastoma (both the most common and most fatal type of brain tumour). He’s had surgery and is starting radiotherapy and chemo soon but they’ve been told that only 15% of people with this tumour live past a year, even with treatment. 

I have a very complicated relationship with my parents and as they caused me a fair bit of trauma in my childhood. They are nicer people now but I still have a lot of unexpressed anger towards them which makes our dynamic uncomfortable at the best of times. I feel distant from them emotionally and like we don’t have a strong bond. 

I live with my husband a few hundred miles away from the rest of my family. Dad has my mum and stepsister around, but I’m his only biological child. I feel like I’m expected to be there way more, do more, say more - but I don’t think I can. If/when he needs lots of care or is dying, not only do I not think I can cope with being there and helping, but I actively don’t want to. Obviously I am scared for my dad and don’t want him to suffer, but the emotional labour of this situation feels totally beyond me and I don’t want to suffer with him either. 

I’m worried it would leave my mental health even more broken that it already is (has been quite fragile for years and I’m only just looking at starting treatment for the BPD and trauma caused by my childhood). Because I’ve had so many years of either being suicidal or just trying to self-destruct, my instinct with anything now is to put my own well-being and my husband first, start recovering, and make sure I’m not doing any further damage to my psyche. I don’t want to do any of the stuff that’s expected of me and I’m shit scared of the whole thing. 

I feel like every single cancer/illness narrative says the person who doesn’t feel able to be around as much is horrible and selfish. The good people are the ones who sacrifice themselves and spend most of their time looking after their parent’s needs. I used to work in social care and when discussing seriously ill older people their children were always demonised and talked badly about for not becoming their carer, or not being close by at all times. I knew that it wouldn’t be that simple where my family were concerned but I didn’t expect to have to deal with it this soon. I always thought it’d happen when I was older and more competent and functioning well enough to meet my obligations. I’m 27 and my life is a mess. 

I feel fucking evil and selfish and so angry with myself for having these thoughts and feelings. I wish I could do what society and my family expect of me, but from reading about how this horrid disease develops...I don’t think I can without destroying my sanity or my life. And I don’t want to do that anymore. I fully intend to do as much as I can - but I fear that’s not a lot. 

I don’t even have a therapist I can vent this to. The only person who understands how I feel is my husband, but he also hasn’t had a family member be this ill. I feel completely and utterly alone and most other stories I’ve seen fail to comfort me because I can’t relate to the wholesome,  straightforward relationships other people have with their parents, and the complete selfless dedication they show. I feel actively alienated by it. I don’t even want to go home for Christmas (even though it could conceivably be my dad’s last) because it’s so painful - I’d rather stay with my in laws and be surrounded by laughter and love and not have to face any of this. 

Someone please make me feel like I’m not crazy or horrible because I’m emotionally flagellating myself atm and can’t get past it. I’ve convinced myself I’m a selfish piece of shit who doesn’t deserve any kind of family. Is keeping my distance a little bit even an option here? 

Please nobody be mean or judgy. I feel very fragile and just need help. X",2019-11-30 18:17:51

Things have been sliding even further downhill since then.  She's not really eating.  She takes a few bites, after a lot of verbal and some physical coercion.  But that's literally all, a few bites.  She has lost so much weight.  Now she isn't eating and has had diarrhea nonstop for over a week.  The doctors keep releasing us because it's just diarrhea and they can get her back on track in the hospital.  But as soon as we're out she's back to not eating.  Not that she really eats that well in the hospital.  

Every night since she was diagnosed (I took her to the ER and stayed with her the first several days) she has wanted me to hold her hand to go to sleep.  I feel like I'm holding her hand while she slowly dies and it's ruining me.  She's not even two yet.  This is so fucking stupid and unfair.

Part of the reason is that I have finals the next week, but that's not really the issue. I can work at my parent's house – there's plenty of space for me to find a quiet corner and study. I don't want to go because last year, as I was packing to go home for Thanksgiving is when we found out about sister's cancer diagnosis. I called my mom trying to figure out what exactly I needed to pack and she just blurted it out in the first minutes of our call, ""your sister has cancer. She's a year older than me, diagnosed with breast cancer at 24 and within 3 months was classified as stage 4.

I don't want to go home for Thanksgiving because I don't want the reminder. The reminder of fear, hopelessness, and of the time where I had to be there for everyone. I allowed and encouraged my parents and sister to lean on me in ways I couldn't handle, especially two weeks before final exams. I allowed myself to be driven into the ground trying to hold everyone's feelings for them.

I don't want to go back this year and really feel like I can't if I want to stay focused on my exams.

The prognosis is not good and he's more than likely not coming home.

I am just sitting here absolutely sobbing and wailing. Why? Why does this horrible disease exist? It's just not fair. I am becoming a paranoid wreck in general over this. I can't believe this.

She fought long and hard for 4 years, but in the end it kept growing and she, along with her doctors decided no more chemo or surgeries could be done without her loosing more speech & without her becoming totally immobile, and the cancer was just growing too fast. Fast forward a couple months to me being 23 and having my mom go in for a routine breast exam and then finding an abnormality on the scan. She had to wait a week to get into the 3D imaging and during that week I was a wreck. I couldn’t breathe or sleep and hardly ate. Today she went in for another scan and they said she just has dense breast tissue and should always opt for 3D scans. Im absolutely relieved because I don’t think I could take another loss.

314,I’m(22f) losing my mom (59) and don’t know how to feel,11,cwuywv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/cwuywv/im22f_losing_my_mom_59_and_dont_know_how_to_feel/,8,1567075649.0,"I’m not sure if this is where I should post this, or if I should even post this. Anyway. My mom (59) was diagnosed with cancer for the third time back in July of 2018. It has been a roller coaster and very obvious this was going to be it. 
When she was first diagnosed, she didn’t tell me right away. I(22 f) just got engaged at the end of May and she didn’t want to “take away the happiness”. At first I was upset but after some time I understood what she could of possibly meant. I then began to realize that this time was aggressive and wasn’t going to be easy. We planned our wedding for September 21st 2019. She had been a part of the planning and was so so so excited for the big day. 
Last Friday, she went to the hospital because she was having pain and a lot of bloating. They found out her cancer has spread completely taking over the Liver. They then talked about the options with her. Skip forward to Monday, she was still in the hospital. I came up to see her but she was sleeping. I gently woke her up and told her I just came by after work to check on her and I would let her sleep. She told me that she loved me and definitely needed the sleep. I could just tell a difference in her, I began to tear up and said “I love you too, I’ll see you tomorrow”. That’s when she promised me not to cry because she will be at the wedding and everything was going to be okay. I promised-definitely didn’t keep it. 
The next day my dad called me as I was on my way home from work telling me that the doctor just called and that they took a liter of fluid off her lungs but she has made zero improvements and they think it’s best to stop radiation and just make her comfortable and think about hospice. I went straight to the hospital and it was like a completely different person. She was completely out of it, I would talk to her and she wouldn’t even notice me there. I told her I was going to go home and that I loved her and she softly said “I love you too” 
Today, she is gasping and struggling to breathe, so I know it’s not going to be much longer. But I can not calm myself down. It just does not make sense on why it would happen now when I need her the most. We (My fiancé and I) just bought a house and she was just so excited to get out and come see it. 
I really don’t know how to feel at this point. I feel robbed.",2019-08-29 10:47:29

316,Dad died last week,10,9prl8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/9prl8p/dad_died_last_week/,5,1540042864.0,"A week ago, my dad died from stage 4 colon cancer. He was diagnosed a week after thanksgiving last year. Mets to his liver and lungs. He did chemo for a few months then stopped getting treatment. He went into home hospice in July. He died at home with his 7 kids and my mom. 

I don’t really know why I’m posting this. I guess I just need people to know about him. He was the best man I’ve ever known. I can’t think of a single time in my life when he raised his voice. He raised his kids with respect and love. His favorite thing in the world was to spend time with us, and everything he did in his life was to provide a better life for us. He took us on adventures and taught us about history and art and music and science fiction. He read to us before bed- the hobbit was his favorite book. He read lord of the rings, red wall, Harry Potter. He told us stories of when he was a popcorn boy in the circus and his best friend there Bessie the elephant.

When we were in trouble we could call him any time day or night, and he would come without a second thought. He always had the right thing to say and do to help us. He didn’t do the work for us, but he walked us through finding our paths. 

He adored his 8 grandkids and doted on them. He bought Christmas gifts for our dogs. He welcomed our friends and SOs with open arms and always made them feel comfortable. 

He and my mom had the kind of love that you don’t think actually exists until you see it. Complete and utter devotion no matter what happened. 

One of the last things he said to me was to be one of the good guys. That hit hard. I realized that he wanted me to continue on the way he loved. He was always one of the good guys. I was his youngest daughter. I took him for granted. I thought he would always be there and now I know that he won’t be. But the things he taught me will never leave.

Be kind to anyone and everyone. Be generous. Be compassionate. Never judge people. Always see the good in people first. If you make a mistake, own it and learn from it. Never forget your roots or your family. Live life without regret.

My fathers name was Bill. And if you are lucky enough to have known him, your life is forever special for it.

I’m really sad that he might never see the person I’m going to become, or be there for me during the big moments of my life. And I worry about my mom a lot as well.

My mother was diagnosed with lung cancer about 2 years ago. They first said it was diagnosed at an early stage, that she was lucky. She got surgery and removed a part of her lung + radiation and chimo.
It was hard for her but she recovered and could have a normal life for about a year. Unfortunately she started to feel pain in her legs, the cancer was back and had metastasized to her brain and the spinal cord. I knew then that it was serious and her life was threatened but I still believed she could recover because she never told us what type of cancer she had, just that she had to do chimo again and that it was the only way. She did it, I saw her suffer like I never saw anyone suffer and when it's your mother, it's the worst experience of a lifetime. I stood by her and I had hope. A few months later she did her exams and they were positive, no more cancer, we were happy but she wasn't, she said it could come back (I believe she knew things we didn't), I tried to cheer her up.
But she was still very tired, she had nausea and felt weak. We thought it was the chimo? She said she was OK and that we shouldn't worry too much. But it became worse everyday... We never thought it could be cancer because 3 weaks earlier her results were good!
Then a Monday morning, she doesn't answer my texts, I call her she is crying and suffering like hell, the doctor is on the way. I went to her home, she couldn't move and she couldn't stop vomiting, the ambulance came and she went to the hospital, I couldn't go with her because of freaking covid...
2 days later the results of her exams are in, she still has cancer, and it's still on her brain.
Everything collapsed, we were devasted... I could talk to her on the phone and she told me she would fight but I've already noticed she had changed, she said things with no sense, I knew it was because of the tumor. 
Unfortunately the doctors told us it wouldn't work, that there was nothing to do... When I could finally visit her at the hospital, she wasn't really conscious, she could see us but we could see she wasn't herself completely. She was suffering again and again, they let her suffer at least 4 days before giving her more morphine.
Later she was transferred to a specific facility for people at the end of life (I don't know if it's correct, English isn't my first language).
She is still there now, we don't know if she's conscious, sometimes she answers and speak with us even if it doesn't really makes sense, sometimes she smiles and laughs with us, I wish she doesn't realizes where she is, I think she is between reality and her dreams, I hope she finds peace but my world is crushed forever, she is my mother, my best friend...

We believe she knew that her cancer would come back and that she didn't have a lot of time left, she just didn't want us to worry.

It's hard to understand how it can be gone but be back just a few weeks later.

I am devastated, I try to stay strong but it's so hard...

My dad got diagnosed with rectal cancer back in October, and he just finished his 12th round of chemo. Anyways, he was saying that the first worrying symptom he had was having blood in his poop. Is it weird that ever since he got diagnosed, I look back in the toilet after I’ve pooped to check if there’s blood or anything? Thank you guys 💕",2020-05-17 09:52:18

334,It happened..,11,enfh5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/enfh5l/it_happened/,8,1578815198.0,"So I posted awhile back in here just to get my mind off of things and well, today it happened. My mom passed away. The last few days have been pretty awful as she declined rather quickly. Last night I had my friend, boyfriend, niece and her husband surrounded by her just waiting and wondering what would happen. The noises she made are something I won't forget. The pain she was in must have been awful and it hurt so much to see her that way.   
Around 3AM my friend, niece and her husband left. We didn't know exactly what would happen and so we needed rest. We had heard in the state she was in could last up to 24-48 hours. I fell asleep and my boyfriend stayed by her side. This is what hurts the most because while he tried to wake me up multiple times, I groaned and said, ""I'm too tired"" ""One minute.""  
Around 7AM he came up and told me I needed to come downstairs. He went back down after I said I will in a minute, yet again. When he came back up he had told me he thought she had passed and I immediately shot up and called my friend. The moment walking downstairs and seeing her so still is just heartbreaking. My friend and niece rushed over and it was all a blur. I called so many people and my body felt numb.   
Before they took her away I said a few things to her because like my usual self, I was too much of a coward to say anything to her while she was still here. I did pray before I fell asleep, when she was still here.  
Knowing that I'll never see her or talk to her again hurts me. What hurts me the most is the fact that I regret these years of how we treated each other. I wish I had been a better daughter to her and made her loved like I knew she wanted to. Yet I let the past and my anger towards her leave me unable too. I did love and care for my mom. I just didn't show it to her in the way I should have. I tried my best to take care of her in the last few weeks, yet I wish I did more.   
The feelings come in waves. Sometimes I feel like I got this and other times I just break down. I have my family around to support me, but sometimes I feel so alone. I just wish this was a dream because it doesn't feel real at all.",2020-01-12 07:46:38

It was also the day after we found out he has stage 4 prostate cancer. This was the start to the hardest best two years of my life. He has surgery, radiation, and even chemo since at 55 his progression was very fast so his best chance of remission was aggression. My wife is a very emotional person so I did a lot of comforting her during this time. In addition to all this my older sister is hospitalized with a bowel obstruction. This wasn't that crazy because she has had severe ulcerative colitis her whole life. The week before Thanksgiving she has surgery to remove the section of colon causing the issue. Initially there was no extra concern because it appeared to be a normal albeit severe part of her disease. But the doctors did their due diligence in testing and we found out the day after Christmas they found a tumor inside the section of colon they removed. Further testing showed it didn't originate from where they thought, but has moved there from the ovaries. This was extra hard with both my wife and I now having family members sick in addition to planning our wedding. My father in law finished his chemo in time to not only walk my wife down the aisle, but he also had his hair. My sister was too weak/sick from her treatments to make it there physically but one of my aunts had her there via Skype. Two months and four days later the cancer won. She was so strong and her last few months the doctors said there was no medical reason she was alive, but she kept fighting. I'm thankful that she isn't hurting anymore but it hurts that she's gone.

Every. Night. My mother was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer in September and then lung cancer in October. I’ve been begging my father to help her understand the severity of her illness cuz the doctors won’t. They won’t give us an estimate of how long she has. they won’t tell her she is dying.  it hurts because it’s already been 3 months, and I’m terrified she could die anytime now  and not get to say goodbye to anyone. 

    She’s undergoing chemo and radiation. So far it hasn’t been too rough, but she’s only had 2 chemo treatments so far. She doesn’t know that it isn’t going to cure her. Idk why the doctors didn’t tell her that it only helps with symptoms and may lengthen ur time.  She says she isn’t losing hope til the doctors tell her there’s ‘nothing they can do’. 

         Dad said he tried to tell her gently and she refused to take his word. Then he had hospice come to our house and she flipped. She said ‘why is hospice here, they are for people who are dying. why do I need a will? I’m not dying yet’. 

          Her brother was trying to explain her cancer to her over the phone, I guarantee he probably told her it is incurable. She is Korean so she has a hard time understanding words like ‘pancreas’ and ‘advanced’, but her brother speaks it. He even wanted to fly down and see her and she told him not to contact her! they aren’t talking currently, they haven’t for nearly a month.

       I talked to her about it twice, because she was upset at dad. She said she thinks dad is ‘ready for her to die’. she said ‘how can you be sure I’m dying when I’ve only had one treatment’ and was yelling and crying. She said she is trying to stay positive and hopeful she gets better because she doesn’t want to leave us. She also mentioned that if she knew she was dying she’d become depressed again. She even said if she dies tomorrow then so what and I was like, don’t you want to say goodbye to us and finish unfinished business? hearing my mom say that was beyond hard. 

      I am in absolute pieces. I have no friends to talk to about this, my BEST friend of 5 years left me for good shortly after this all hit (I don’t miss her). I feel like my life is ending, I don’t wanna live without my mom.  School only makes it worse. This is so heart wrenching and the fact she doesn’t understand or is in denial is HARD :( how the heck can I tell her? I’m not trying to ‘protect her’ or anything, but my dad definitely is. He’s too afraid to say anything again cuz the way she reacted last time. What am I to do?

He became really sick and malnourished so we took him to ER again and they performed a CAT Scan. They found a Mass.

Biopsy of the Mass diagnosed it as Stage 4 Cancer and now he's been in the hospital since then.

My mom is 64 and was just diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer, which has metastasized to her brain. It's been a bit of a shock - my parents have been going through a lengthy, nasty divorce and I think my mom had been chalking up most of her symptoms to stress and anxiety from that (shortness of breath, diarrhea, fatigue, loss of appetite/weight loss). In the last three or four weeks, however, her health has declined rapidly (starting with pain in her chest and having a hard time breathing) and a visit to the ER led to a CAT scan of her brain which has confirmed multiple lesions there. She also has spots in her breast and lung(s). While we are waiting to learn ""what kind"" of cancer she has, everything I have read here points to lung cancer. She was a lifetime smoker, just quit within the last 6 month so that's... a cruel irony. Because of COVID, she can't even get in to see an oncologist until the 5th and I am worried about what that wait will mean given the rapid decline she's already seen. 

I knew it was bad when I went to visit her last Monday. I could see it in her. She is a shadow of her former self. It was really heartbreaking. She's done a lot to try to cover up just how bad things were. Trying to ""protect us kids."" And now that my dad has moved across the country post-divorce, it leaves my sister and I to figure out how to help my mom through this. My sister is in denial, I think, and is approaching this with a ""she can still beat this"" mentality. I have an 18 month old at home (who goes to daycare), a full time job, and live 90 minutes away. My mom is in the process of selling the family house (again, divorce) and just signed a lease on an apartment two weeks ago... a second floor apartment. In the last week and a half she has lost the use of one of her legs and is having bouts of temporary blindness in one eye.

I don't know how to do this. What role I should play. Where my mom should go. How much I need to step in. How long she can/should live on her own. If we should try to cancel the lease on the apartment. If we should try to stall the sale of the house. When/how to approach hospice. If I should go to her doctor appointments. If I should ask to be made a health proxy. When I should ask my mom to detail out her last wishes. It's... it's a lot. I know that you all know this. 

I know the person who did her CAT scan said something like ""They are doing amazing things these days. You might get another 1-2 years!"" And I'd like to believe that, but I know deep in my gut that this is going to move fast. 

Any insight you all can provide would be most appreciated. 

I am not a naturally ""warm and fuzzy"" person. I am not good with death (I mean, who is?). But it's been a really tough year (including the divorce and the unexpected death of my nephew) and I just want to try to do right by mom here at the end, even if none of this comes naturally to me. I'm only going to get to do this once, you know?

I was in college at the time and my parents thought it was best to finish my last two weeks before coming back. I came home to a skeleton looking father that still visually haunts me today. 

Fast forward to about 2 years ago, my mom went in for her first routine colonoscopy with no symptoms. They found a tumor about the size size of a softball. It was removed and went through 12 rounds of chemo. She was in remission for 2 1/2 months until last week when they found some lovely dark spots on her ovaries. They thought it was completely unrelated to the colon cancer and very certain that it was a unique instance and most likely benign, especially since all her diagnostic test comeback clean. Today was her hysterectomy surgery (just as an extra precaution), only to find that her colon cancer has relapsed.

I’m 33 and I don’t know how to be there for her this time. Its not the idea of her dying that makes me incredibly sad, it’s knowing how emotionally distraught, angry, and terrified she must be feeling right now. She is one of the healthiest adults I know. She walks daily, she has never smoked, I can only think of two instances at weddings that I’ve seen her have a drink, and she eats like a rabbit. 

I don’t know if I can be that strong/positive supportive family member this time and already angry at myself for being very pessimistic about  the outcome. I’m also so selfishly terrified now that it’s only a matter of time before I join the chemo club (I’m having my first dermatologist appointment this Friday to remove a “very minor” case of skin cancer - I hope the doctors are right this time)

I'm worried. I won't lie about that. But he beat this before. His oncologist says that in cases like his, they typically see improvement. And in a worst case scenario, I'm ready to give him a lobe of lung just like I was willing to give him a kidney.

I was so proud of him for being open and honest with the doctors in hopes of getting to the bottom of what’s going on. 

The procedure only lasted 10 minutes.. we were told they had to stop because a mass was found near his rectum and while we need to wait for the biopsy to confirm, the GI doctor would be “shocked” for it to not be cancerous. 

My heart is broken. After a few hours at home, the GI doctor already had an appointment for my father to see an oncologist on Friday and an MRI that afternoon. It felt like an absolute whirlwind. Like we didn’t even have time to really process. 

I have never seen my dad scared and it’s been 15 years since he cried in front of me. And I know we don’t have all the information right now but I’m terrified. I’m also so fucking angry that the first thought both he and my mom had was “how are we going to afford this?”, no human on this earth should have to worry if their actual health is some they can afford. I just want to scream. The U.S. Healthcare system is a nightmare and even though my parents have a good amount of savings (for their retirement) and insurance, this could absolutely bankrupt them. 


I’m trying to not go into overdrive and research online until I have more facts/next steps. Luckily my cousin is an RN at a local cancer center. But I took off work today to process. 

Has anyone seek out Cancer Family Support group therapy?  I’ve needed to go back to personal therapy for a while now and I don’t know if I’ll make it through this without it, but was interested if the group setting would be more beneficial in this case?

Standing messy haired 

And rumple clothed in the supermarket

I felt the eyes of a stranger

Dissatisfied with my appearance 

And I thought 

“Are you a hero?”

I think this often

Everyday 

When a customer is annoyed

That they have to wait so long at the bar 

And now I’ve poured the wrong beer

I think

“Are you a hero?”

When I’m not replying 

To an enquiry made online 

And the acquaintance seems angry 

I think 

“Are you a hero?”

When I look worn and dishevelled

And I make mistakes 

When I forget simple things 

And all it does is frustrate 

I think 

“Are you a hero?”

My mother is dying 

And I cannot save her 

I am no hero

Maybe that’s you? 

And if you are a hero 

Can you save me too?

He went through chemo and radiation and responded well. We thought all was going well, his tumor was gone, he didnt need to have surgery and he still had his voice. Anyway, he goes in for a scan to offically confirm it's completely gone, to find out a new spot showed up on the scan. He has a new tumor at the end of esophagus. A biospy confirms its cancer, secondary primary. Its more serious this time. 

I live a bit away from my family, and this weekend went to visit, today was the first time seeing my dad since the new diagnoses. I get a chance to talk to my dad alone. He is very irritable and even kind of mean, Im trying to understand but I'm hurting too. We get into deeper conversation, and I asked if the doctors have given him a time frame, he tells me no right away. I knew deep down he was lying so I asked if he was, he said he was. He didnt want to tell me, my sister is getting married in 3 weeks and he didnt want any of his daughters to know...at least until after the wedding to not take away from her big day. But he tells me the doctor gave him 6 months-2 years to live...2 years if he is lucky and responds to chemo.

Thankfully he is going to go for treatment...he claims his surgeon believes it is curable. Not sure if I believe that if he was given up to 2 years to live. I make a promise to him not to tell my sisters. I'm spending time with them (I dont see them very much) and I'm watching them have a good time and enjoy themselves while all I can think of is my dad's 'timeline'. I'm actually envious of their ignorance of the info. Today, in this moment I wish I didnt know. I know not knowing doesnt change anything.

Thanks to the fantastic treatment from his doctors and nurses, the chemo has successfully treated the cancer that spread, and hormone therapy is suppressing the cancer in the prostate.

But looking forward, I'm so scared. He'll be on hormone therapy to keep the cancer suppressed in the prostate for the rest of his life, but we have no idea how long it will be an effective for. One day, whether it be in twenty years or two months, the cancer will spread again and it will kill him. Every three months he'll have to have check ups to see if it's spread again. 

And this is what it will be like for the rest of his life, for him and me and the family. A three month cycle of rising anxiety, incredible relief, and then the anxiety will creep in again that the next appointment will be the one that gives us the bad news. I'm emotionally exhausted already and we've not even reached the first check up (it's only been two months since the end of chemo).

I picked him up from Cancer Care, he gets in the car and tells me he has mantle cell lymphoma, only 10 people per year are diagnosed with it in our province. It is incurable and he has 5 years tops, and he'll be starting chemo next week, but all they can hope for is remission but it'll just keep coming back and be harder to treat. So he's crying, I'm crying, he's talking like he's getting his affairs in order, like he could go at any time.

We get home, wait for my mom and sister to get there, so we can hear the recording of what the Dr said (because my mom asked him to do that) and at no time did she ever say he had 5 years tops. She did say it was incurable, and the goal is remission, and it does get harder to treat every time it comes back, but she also said the treatment is more successful these days than it used to be. You used to see patients living 5-7 years, and now it's more like 7-10 years.

She also said the average patient with this type of cancer is 70 years old, and because he's 58 and his heart is strong, they can go a more aggressive route with the chemo, and with that along with maintenance including stem cell transplant, he could possibly be in remission for 10 years.

Even after that, he's googling mantle cell lymphoma, and on American sites it says only 5-10% of patients live to 10+ years with it. But we're in Canada, people tend to go get checkups more often, and the treatment could be different, and that's including all the older patients, and those sites could be outdated. He just keeps seeking out worst case scenarios. 

How do I support him without lecturing him? I'm scared his treatments won't be as effective without a positive attitude.",2019-07-31 05:42:27

It's been a long journey to get to this diagnosis. It started out as colon cancer they thought would be cured with surgery alone.

Then it was stage 3 colon cancer and he would need chemo.

Then they found more masses, mainly in his liver. They did a biopsy and let us know today that he is, indeed, at stage 4 metastasized colon cancer.

We are all still reeling from this. 

Understandably, my dad isn't sure if he wants to go through treatment at this point.

As pressure ascended in our marriage, I kept being the caring spouse I was. On the day she began chemo again, I left the center to advance toward a cosmetics store, About Face of New Orleans. I had noticed that Shana would continually glance in the mirror. She didn't like how her face was breaking out from all the drugs she was taking. I bought a facial treatment and makeover to help her confidence. Although I reminded Shana consistently how beautiful she was, in the wake of losing her hair, I wanted to do whatever I could to help her feel as lovely inside as I felt she was.
After getting her from chemo, I drove back to the cosmetics store. “Just stroll in and give them your name,” I told her. “They know what to do, and everything is paid for.” She was so stunned and eager to see what I had come up with for her. I hung tight outside for a few hours until she was done. When the entryway opened, she resembled an angel from paradise. She was sparkling. I simply watched for quite a while, like I’d never observed her before. Since the time her cancer had come, Shana had lost a great deal of weight. Her figure and face highlights had changed.

For those who haven’t seen my last few posts about my mom, she recently passed away (almost 2 months ago) with stage 4 cancer.
She was only diagnosed a month before her death and never received treatment as it was extremely aggressive and fast growing.
It’s much easier to read my last post, but in sum:
My mom was in the hospital for a month and finally came home 5 days before her passing, as the doctor finally decided she should get to spend her last memories with us at home. About a week before coming home, she became confused and started hallucinating almost always. She was paranoid and kept seeing things that weren’t there.
I feel awful about everything. I miss her so much I can’t describe it. Lately I’ve been having sudden flashes of her when she was sick, and dreams about her being sick almost everyday. Usually in my dreams, I’m able to tell she’s sick and know never to say anything hurtful to her, the way I used to before knowing she was sick. I wasn’t a good daughter to her and I never got to say a proper goodbye. I called 911 thinking they could save her and I’d meet her again at the ER, but once I got to the ER she was gone. I didn’t even get to say I love you to her. I left her alone the morning she passed because I was in the middle of doing laundry, even though she asked me to stay. I’m sobbing as I write this. I keep trying to avoid thinking about it at all and suppress the flashes but recently it’s getting stronger and longer, making it harder to push away. I do therapy but it’s hard for me to even talk about it. I willingly started but a part of me just can’t touch on the subject enough to heal. I have so many regrets and constantly wish it was me, or that I could somehow see or speak to her. I’m having an undescribable amount of trouble coping with the fact that she’s gone. My therapist tells me it’s not my fault but it’s much easier said than to really believe it. Consequently I’ve been distant from my sister and my dad which I think upsets them a lot, but I honestly don’t want to be with them right now. I don’t know when I’ll feel ok being with them but it’s not now, so living with my dad has been pretty tough.
I’m struggling keeping up with school because I’ve lost so much motivation. My original major is close to pre-med so I’ve been thinking about switching ever since my mom’s diagnosis and seeing the way her doctors wronged her. But I’m a sophomore now and I feel like starting pre-med now is too late.
Sorry this post became like a rant halfway through. I feel best posting on here about what I’m feeling because it’s anonymous and everyone’s been so kind and most importantly, relatable. I don’t know what to do. I feel so depressed but I don’t want to talk to my therapist or anyone else about it.",2020-09-24 11:56:06

Sunday was Father’s Day and he ate bbq with my aunt and grandma and was still his happy and normal self. That evening we moved him into his hospital bed that was set up in the living room, about 20 steps from the bed he was in. He could not stand up on his own or lift his foot up to take a step. It took a lot of work but we got him into the new bed Sunday. 

Since then he has become completely different. He is not allowing my sister and I to help him or clean him the way we have been for months. And since he’s been so out of it he’s starting to refuse his meds in an attempt to be more lucid and less confused. He is not accepting what’s happening and he’s fighting death.

She's been fighting this with surgery and radiation for about 2 years. I've been through this a few times with close friends who eventually passed (one from a liver infection during chemo... one from falling and hitting his head in the hospital .. he was doing well and responding well to treatment. Because of the chemo and cancer they couldn't operate safely and he died from a brain bleed) and feel a little more prepared for this than the rest of my family. They've told us that without treatment she has 6 mom's. I know from experience that these timelines can be meaningless. She's planning to get treatment and could go on to live years, she could also get an infection during chemo that takes her. Cancer is so unpredictable...

The 6 month timeline has taken the fight out of my dad. He's in his 70s and seems to have lost the will or energy to fight for her and with her. My mom is very vocal about her feelings and I know how to support her, but I have no idea what to do for my dad. I'm hoping that this is just an initial shock reaction which will fade as we start to fight, but I'm worried seeing her suffer is going to slowly sink him further into a depression we won't get him back from if she passes.

Its in the end stages. He has lived seven months longer than the average person with the kind he has (what I have been told by his doctor at least.) Which gives me both hope and a sense of dread. This is my first time dealing with cancer at such a close level. 
This man is not my biological dad but he has loved me like his blood since he first started seeing my mom when I was a toddler. 
He's taught me so many things, we've spent so many years gaming, cracking jokes, and rescuing animals together. 
I find myself angry that hes sick. Not at him but seeing what this is doing to him. I've seen him cry more in this last year than I have my entire life and it breaks me how badly this makes him feel when I can do nothing. 
The treatment he was on stopped working and there are so many new tumors. Its so aggressive and the next rounds of chemo are going to destroy him. I'm trying so hard to hold myself together but it hurts so much. 
I have my mom, my brother, his fiance, and my dad. That's my family and i don't want to lose the dad that loves me. It doesn't feel fair. At all.

My emotions are so mixed. I’m so grateful that I likely have a few years with him, but I know he’s suffering.

The slow, dragging deterioration is torture to watch, and I’m sure torture for him to endure. I have never seen him look depressed before, but he’s so discouraged. He’s always been so positive, so ready to figure out the next step. I’m so scared he’ll give up. 

He just stopped getting treatment from his third clinical trial, and will likely start another as soon as it’s available. Just another blow to our positive outlook.

She’s been on radiation, chemo, and she’s currently is on keytruda. The consensus is that as long as the keytruda keeps the cancer at bay or even grows slightly, she should just keep doing the immunotherapy. However, if the cancer grows or spreads more than the doctors deem reasonable, we will have to try clinical trails (most of which are out of state either Texas or DC) but even going forward with that there is only about a 10% success rate. Her doctor even thought that taking a break from all treatment was a reasonable option, which is something we didn’t want to hear, but she thought that since my mom was feeling really well, that we should take advantage of this time.

421,Lost my uncle to sarcoma today. He was 44.,8,eph1hq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/eph1hq/lost_my_uncle_to_sarcoma_today_he_was_44/,2,1579195428.0,"I recently moved to California from Oregon to attend medical school last year. I was looking forward to traveling home for Thanksgiving since I could have a chance to relax and enjoy time with my family. That was ruined the day I got home when my dad sat me down and told me my uncle was in the hospital with a brain met. 

He was initially diagnosed and treated with surgery and radiation in fall 2017. The initial lesion was high grade, but superficial. Given his excellent health, we were all pretty optimistic that he would survive. 

He had known about his metastatic disease since February 2019. I guess with his first restaging scan there were suspicious spots in his lungs that grew much more when he was re-scanned a second time. Given the questionable benefit from tradiational chemo (doxorubicin), he was uninterested in therapy. He saw a few specialist centers but they didn't have anything to offer him. He hid this from everyone but my aunt, and no one even knew that he was sick until my dad was called into the hospital after a seizure. 

I saw him in the hospital and he was pretty sick. I've spent a lot of time with cancer patients at my job before med school so while I had seen people who were similarly sick, I wasn't prepared to see him dazed, in and out of a benzo/opioid fog only able to say a few sentences at a time. The initial game plan was to get him to surgery, do high dose radiation to his chest and spine, then wait for a month postop to decide whether he could start chemo or not. 

He made it through surgery okay. The next several days were difficult as he was struggling to recover. He was paralyzed on the left side from the tumor and was frustrated with the aggressive PT. Conversations started to change and he decided to get discharged to a hospice house, with the intent to transfer home once he was independent enough to do so. I was prepared for him to die within days, since everyone's outlook was pretty bleak. But he kept hanging in there. 

Christmas break for me was similarly stressful. I am very grateful that I got to spend time with him, but it's hard to sleep and relax when you know your uncle will be dying. We got to spend a few hours alone together, and since he had recovered a little from surgery he was now able to have a proper conversation with me. It was sad to see him still exhausted, wasting away, and paralyzed, but it was better than he was in the hospital. 

He made it all the way through Christmas break. Everyone suspected that the lung tumors would grow aggressively and that once he needed oxygen, he would rapidly decline. But he kept satting okay on his own, only using a nebulizer when he started to cough. 

Conversations started to shift again. He wasn't fully independent like he needed to be but he was stabilizing, more or less. There was a question of whether or not he might be able to start therapy just to give him a few months. He was supposed to get discharged from hospice to his house- after two months being in the hospital/hospice- last Friday. Everything was ready. The hospital bed had been installed in the first floor, my aunt was trained to take care of him, etc. 

Then the hallucinations started. He had a difficult time distinguishing what was real and what wasn't. I thought it might have been the lack of sleep, and there was a whole other issue where his dog escaped and went missing for 5 days, so I had hoped some of it was stress. 

I called my dad last night when I was driving home from work. I geeked out about the stuff I had learned today since he's a physician. We were talking about the pathophysiology of Hodgkin's disease. I could tell something was off, so naturally I asked how things were going with my uncle. 

""I spoke to the doctor today. She thinks this is the end of things, and that Benji has a few days left. He's having more neurologic symptoms. Could be brain swelling vs. new tumor.""

""Well if we don't knew if it's a tumor why don't they restart the steroids? If it's just swelling there's a chance he can ride this out."" 

""I don't know the answer to that. I'm sorry. You should give him a call and leave him a voicemail."" 

What do you say to a dying 44 year old who meant so much to you? All I remember is telling him I loved him, that he will always be my favorite uncle, and that we would take care of his family. 

He wasn't awake when I called, but I asked my aunt to tell me when she played it to him. 

I woke up this morning to a call from my dad. I guess Benji went to sleep last night and just didn't wake up, and died around 6:30 AM. I don't know if he heard my message, and I don't really want to ask. 

Benji was the best uncle I could have asked for. He was super invested in my life, especially before having kids of his own. He was super tech-y and always showed us cool stuff like digital cameras, and his Atari. He eventually went to dentistry school- not because he was particularly passionate about dentistry, but because he knew it was a stable career choice. He ended up being passionate about community dentistry and spent most of his time taking care of low-income patients. His last job was working on establishing a low-income dental clinic. He was funny, like a really crass kind of funny that was mostly appropriate for kids but occasionally got darting glances from my mom when he was toeing the line. He was a wonderful dad to my two cousins, and a really good husband to his wife. He was a good, healthy person and everything about this situation is unfair. 

I feel pretty numb about everything. It's exceptionally difficult to study medicine when it just failed your family, big-time. There's seemingly no justice in the fact that I have a 92 year old great-grandma who is still alive and a 44 year old dad of two teenagers died. I also feel guilty because when I was talking to my dad earlier this week, I had told him that part of me wanted it to be over because I was so exhausted of worrying about him. I worry that maybe some weird karmic bullshit took me seriously. I *really* hope he heard my voicemail. 

To Benji: I meant what I said last night. I love you so much. I love the fact that you were actively part of my life even when we lived thousands of miles away from each other. I am really devastated that you couldn't see me graduate med school, or see my sister graduate college, or even see your kids go to prom. I hope you know that we will take care of your family now, and make sure they're okay. I know we used to tease you guys about living so close to us but maybe it was a sign from the universe that we needed to spend more time together. I'm gonna keep going through med school because it's what I really want from my life, but I'm gonna make sure that I don't lose myself in medicine. I hope that's what you would have wanted from me. I'll have to go back to Hana every few years because it's my favorite place on earth, too. I'll miss you more than you could ever imagine. I love you.

She doesn't realize that treatment is just a way to extend her life, not a cure. She's very tired all the time and her left side and balance don't work properly (brain tumor) but she refuses to get anyone to help her at home with daily chores, so she just stopped cleaning altogether. I come and visit when I can and one of my brothers takes care of her the rest (most) of the time, but he works during the day. Some days she's ok and can walk to and from the bathroom alone, others she can't or risks falling every step she takes. She wakes up twice a night to go to the bathroom and needs help doing these short trips (about 20 feet). She already fell a few times and now has a scar on her face because of her lack of balance. Recently I ended up changing her diaper and cleaning poop off of her and out of her bed. My brother and her both insists she doesn't need help. She also can't fix her own food. 

I feel like this is no way of living and the good relationship I once had with my mom is gone. Sometimes I find myself wishing it would be over sooner... I feel bad about it... but it hurts to see my mom in this state with no help and no idea what's going on. Any advice on the situation would be welcome.",2020-01-12 15:15:14

My parents are divorced, so my dad lives with his wife and my brother, and most of the time I’m with my mom and older sister. I’ve struggled with severe depression since I was around four years old, but my older sister only recently started experiencing it, and she tried to kill herself. Fortunately she did not succeed, and is fine now, thriving in high school! She never had a close relationship with our dad, and they would often get in fights, then my dad and my stepmom would fight, then my mom and dad would fight, and I’m stuck in the middle of it. I’m so devoid of any emotion now. I’ve been around a sick person for what feels like my entire life, because of the traumatic experiences my body forces older memories out, if that makes sense? I feel abandoned by my family, left to take care of my dad and brother, and be cowering when people fight, and expected to be the “peace bringer” for both sides...I take medication, and have taken the same since 5yrs, but I feel worse and empty. Nobody tells me anything, but they expect me to comfort dad because I’m the only one there for him. I need a break, I’m only 13, I don’t want this, my dad’s my best friend, he calls me his clone.

I’m 17 and my mom has been diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer for a little over 4 months now. I hate even saying it but i feel like i haven’t accomplished much for her during this time. I have helped a lot more around the house and have offered emotional support. I’ve really wanted to make memories I can look back on since she won’t be here. I want to make every day count and live in the present but when I try it just feels like sand slipping through my fingers. it KILLS me. It eats away at my soul. I appreciate every single day God gives me with her, and put extra thought and love into the words I speak to her and the gifts ive given her. But I feel like it isn’t enough...... 

we have never really been the kind to do stuff together.  One thing is that technology takes away from our family time and my parents don’t seem to realize it. When I think back, and I mean think REALLY hard,  a lot of the time I struggle to come up with memories of her. it might just be the weight of it all that’s consuming my every thought, but it seriously depresses me either way. We went on our first vacation together this year to the beach but I didn’t touch the sand once with her, I feel so guilty and just sad, it was the only vacation we will ever get to go on together. I will probably forever wish I had went on the beach with her. In the grand scheme of things that isn’t important right now but it still upsets me that I let such valuable things slip away. 

I do have some special memories of her in my heart, but I think ever since this psychiatrist I used to see tried to implant false memories in my head I have a better time at remembering bad memories of her than good. the doctor tried so hard to make me believe my mom was abusive and was practically begging me to take Prozac. I definitely will treasure the happy moments I’ve had with her. 

I already said I would start NOW at making an effort of this stuff, and that was 4 months ago. A lot of the time I keep to myself in my room  like I always have, and then I’m like ‘why am I in here binging shows when I could be with mom’ and then go talk to her. it’s honestly pathetic how much time I have spent to myself, probably me numbing myself to what’s happening around me. My friends families seem so interconnected and have family nights and watch movies together and my family is the complete opposite. I feel like if I start proposing we eat dinner together or ask to watch a movie together my mom and dad will think I’m trying to make up for time lost or something. It all just seems SO foreign to me now, even sitting down for a meal. 

School starts back Thursday and I’m going to try and get on homebound. I was considering it 4 months ago but I was apprehensive. My best friend at the time who Is now long gone told me ‘what do you value more, your last year of high school or your last moments with your mom?’ And it hasn’t left my mind. I could give up school in a second, I don’t really have any friends left or any desire to go. Ever since my moms diagnosis I’ve lost that best friend of 5 years and I talk to no one outside of school. Only reason I’ve stayed in school was school work. I also need to take off bc my dad has been away from work for several months to take care of her and during that time we haven’t made a dime, his boss is begging him to return. So now it’s my time to really step it up.",2019-12-29 17:19:00

I'll have to relearn how to drive in the snow and deal with the winter on top of watching my dad decline.  I think my conflicted feelings are just stemming from me leaving my comfort zone and knowing that the inevitable is looming. My father has been withdrawn so I know it will be good to be there but I also have a feeling he isn't looking forward to the situation, though that just may be me being my own worst enemy with negative thoughts. Everyone who I've spoken to about this says I won't regret making this move but would have regretting not being closer. We have a lot to take care of too.  I'm unsure of his will, his wishes, how he'd like to handle end of life care, funeral arrangements, etc and it's been hard to get my dad to open up about these things.

The cancer was diagnosed in July and she started chemo in August. They were supposed to operate the stomach after two months of chemo, but by the time the tumor had already spread to the pancreas so the operation was cancelled... She also had some metastases in a few lymph nodes. So ultimately we heard the cancer was incurable and she is going to die. She has now been getting different chemo since then.

We are currently waiting for the next ct scan results in agony and fear, which will be ready next week. I am so afraid the cancer has spread or the chemo's not working. My mom is only in her 50s and too young to die. I'm in my early 20s and my father has already passed away. I have no idea how I'll ever be okay again after this.

I know my mom doesn't have too much time left, and I should see her more often, but it's so painful to see her be only a shadow of the strong, athletic and energetic woman she used to be 😭

Seven years ago my nephew was diagnosed with cancer. He was only four years old at the time. It was Wilms Tumor and he had a kidney removed.
He did need chemo however. 

That was not a pleasant time for myself, my family, my sister and her family. It did show us how supportive of a network we all had. Our nephew was the first born grandchild for our parents.

So, we were happy after chemo was done that our nephew was clear and was starting to get on with life as a regular kid should.

And now today has happened.
My nephew now has skin cancer.

I still don't know all the details. But I now feel like shit. I'm upset this has happened.
I know our family will continue with our strong support system. However, I am worried that this could be bad and that my nephew may have to go through chemo again or could even die.

It took me many years to realize, you’ve been the worlds greatest dad. My first memories of you are you picking me up from preschool and how exited I’d be to run to and hug you. I’d get that same feeling of love I still get anytime I huge you. As a child, anytime I needed you, you were always there. As a kid, if there was thunder and lightening at night, I would run to you and feel protected. If there was a scary movie on, I’d sit on your lap and hug you and I always knew I’d be safe in your arms. 

Dad, you were always there. Never did I feel like you were going anywhere. Always reliable and always there for me, S**** and mom, no matter what. Dad, you have always embodied the true definition of a MAN. 

As I grew older, we grew to share a love for sports and all through high school you didn’t miss one single football or basketball game. You knew how competitive I was and I know you took pride in how hard I worked and how hard I competed. I’ll always cherish our time spent bonding over sports over the years. 

As a school teacher, you inspired so many of your students and won many awards. I can recall our family, going out to eat for Mother’s Day, and we ran into one of your former students, who was now an adult. He said, “Mr. G**** you changed my life. You inspired me to become a teacher, thank you.” It was incredibly touching and honest and real. 

I’m so happy to have so many good memories with you dad, especially the past 4-5 years that you’ve been battling advanced prostate cancer. You’ve done incredibly well the first 4 years in this battle, but as we know, things have gotten worse and treatment options have become slim. Unfortunately, you can’t hold food down and you’ve lost more than 25 lbs in the past month. The doctor said you have two months to live, but I know you dad, you’re tough and you’re gonna keep fighting. I know how much you love life, which is why it makes it so much harder to say, goodbye, but I love you, dad and always will. Thank you for being the best dad any kid could ask for. I know soon, you’ll be in heaven and I pray, I’ll see you again one, day.

I know lots of y’all that post are just finding out some devastating news, and every post I read breaks my heart. What I want to talk about today though (or really just vent, I’m having a really hard day) is how even when you’re “used to it”, it’s the little things that are quietly just as painful, but there’s very little support out there when these things come up.

My mom has stage 4 lung cancer, and has been lucky enough to be doing well most days. She receives care at Red Rocks Cancer Center in Colorado and her doctor has a revolutionary radiation technique that has helped her last this long (she is on Medicaid, otherwise there is no way we could afford it). I am her sole provider and much of the time her sole support system as well. My sister, who is 9 years older, is mostly useless, and comes and goes and is a good daughter when she feels like it. I know I am very lucky she’s been able to get the treatment she has, as most do not have the additional years she’s been afforded once they hit stage 4.

The last couple days, she’s been hurting really bad and in particular, she’s in a lot of pain when she gets up and moves or when she breathes in deeply. Her concern is that she has pneumonia again, which happens a few times a year as a result of inflammation from the many inhalers she has. 

I got home from my 2nd job last night after a 17 hour day, exhausted, but my mom wasn’t doing well. At one point, I asked if she was about to go to sleep and she said “she was afraid to sleep”, so I stayed up too and watched some TV with her. Finally she felt ok to sleep so I did too. After a couple hours, I woke up to go to work and found myself watching my mom, who was still sleeping, to make sure she was still breathing.

These are the things that I find it hard to explain to others, because how could you possibly understand unless you also are very aware that it’s possible you could wake up, but your loved one might not? I feel useless in my ability to comfort her because I cannot even pretend to know how she feels. These smaller moments are more devastating to me than the big ones - the tests, the scans, the appointments, the hospital visits even. In those times, I know there are teams of medical professionals far better equipped to handle all of this than I am, and I know she’s in good hands. When it’s 1 in the morning and she’s telling me she’s scared to go to sleep, it’s just me, and I have no idea what to say or do.

Thanks for letting me rant y’all. It was a rough night, resulting in a tough day.",2019-10-17 01:06:47

He was so proud of me, so happy. It was truly one of the best days of my life. Shortly after, he started getting sick, belly pain, losing weight suddenly. After about a month of doctors telling him it was nothing, he ended up in the ER just a week ago. They finally ran tests. They told us they thought it was cancer. Abdominal, maybe pancreatic. I Googled it, and convinced myself that there was no hope, no cure, he was dying. Stage 4 pancreatic, definitely, I figured.

Meanwhile, I was abroad for a work trip when all of this was happening. I flew home early, and after an excruciatingly exhausting and tearful 48 hrs of travel went straight to the hospital to see him with my mom. He was semi lucid, gave a big smile when he saw me, but couldn't talk much, only mumble a word here or there. He had lost so much weight over just a few days. He arms had withered away to nothing. He wasn't able to eat much, and over the course of just a few hours he stopped being able to swallow. He stopped opening his eyes. Stopped mumbling. 

The oncologist finally called us in. The biopsy results weren't complete yet, but from some of the fluid tested they were able to get a diagnosis. It wasn't late stage pancreatic cancer, not pancreatic cancer at all- not the automatic death sentence we had thought. No, instead, it was large cell lymphoma, a cancer that responds to treatment. Now, if he was stronger, if the diagnosis had come a week, a month ago, maybe it would have been good news. But he has declined so much, so rapidly, that it doesn't make a difference that there is a path for treatment. He is leaving us.

My father walked me down the aisle just a month ago, and now he is quickly dying. This doesn't feel real. It can't be real. I don't know what our family will do without him. I just want to dance with him again.",2019-10-10 11:10:49

And even if I go visit for a couple days...I have to come back. I am so upset that we are so far away. I’m so scared. I don’t know what else to do, I’ve reached out to friends who are kind but no one who has been through this particular hell. Anyone else deal with long distance tragedy like this? How did you manage the guilt of not being there instantly or able to stay? How do you go about normal life (I am seriously not well)?",2019-08-22 20:17:51

Trying to stay strong and positive for my mom and my brother.  I feel like my dad has made his peace with it. His vocal cords are paralyzed so he can't really talk anymore. I dont even know what Im trying to say with this post really.  Im just emotionally exhausted and I don't even know how to act around him. I try to be normal but that feels fake. Tried being positive but theres not much to be positive about.  I hope Im wrong but I think hes got a very short time remaining with us. Weeks maybe..hopefully longer but he is in so much pain and hes so miserable.  And I feel guilty because now I think back to all the shitty things I did when I was younger and I just want to tell him Im sorry I wasn't a better daughter. I know Im rambling and I'm sorry.  I just needed to get this out. Everyone I talk to in real life just tells me to stay strong and be positive but its so hard to do and Im so tired of acting like its okay because Im trying so hard not to fall apart.

After jaw reconstruction, losing 60% of his tongue, the dysphagia (unable to swallow), chemo and radiation, the tumor returned, and is now pushing on nerves and arteries in his neck. This is causing episodes of syncope, in which he's basically put into a sleeper hold and faints. A lot of the time is triggered by the intense pain he feels in the area of the tumor. Eyes wide open, blood pressure drops, he's dizzy and sometimes vomits or loses control of his bladder or bowels. All we can do is elevate his feet and lower his head and try to get his blood pressure back up until he comes back around. He's been in the hospital for a week now dealing with this, and doctors are still trying to find the right balance of pain management and techniques to keep his blood pressure up at all times.

He's had a feeding tube since Janurary, so he's lost a lot of weight and muscle, he's very weak. He's strung out on morphine every day in the hospital just to try to keep the pain away. He's got a blister on his face from radiation, right over the new jaw, that is being traumatized by the cancer. It won't heal unless the cancer is removed, and if/when it is he'll probably need plastic surgery to repair his face. This isn't quality of life. His only option is immunotherapy, and my mother and I are fighting to get it started right away. The smaller the tumor, the less is can attack these blood vessels and nerves, and hopefully the less pain he'll feel.

I feel like we're grasping at this point. I'm so lost, I can't even see the next step in the game plan. Laying it all out like that makes it so much scarier. I'm so scared, and I'm so angry for him. He doesn't deserve all this torture. He's a musician, an animal lover, he's my daddy, he's a wonderful, caring person. We knew this fight was going to be difficult, but I'm not so sure any of us can take anymore.

Last night his episode was so bad, I honestly wondered, *is this how it ends? is he dying tonight?* And I almost felt relieved to think he wouldn't be suffering from this anymore. And then I absolutely hated myself for thinking that, I will never give up on him.

Somebody please tell me there's a light at the end of this tunnel, and I just can't see it yet. This has been the saddest, scariest, most exhausting 8 months of all of our lives. This can't all have been for nothing.",2019-07-12 02:11:36
444,my family won’t admit that my dad is dying,8,c6dgck,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/c6dgck/my_family_wont_admit_that_my_dad_is_dying/,8,1561711409.0,"hello pals! This is my first time posting here but I’m just looking for advice I guess. Sorry, this is going to be a bit long. 

A bit of backstory, my dad got diagnosed with colon cancer last November. My parents started to essentially not divulged any information about the severity etc. He’s been doing chemo, had a colon resection, and unfortunately his tumour markers that at first went down are now climbing. . They refuse to tell me real information, so I’ve had to take bits of things they’ve said to piece things together. I’m also in nursing school so I have access to a lot of knowledge that leaves me more curious/wanting to know what’s going on. I also found out a few weeks ago that there are multiple tumours on his liver (I think they knew this months ago but I have to kinda pry to even know what’s going on). My mom finally admitted that he has stage 4 colon cancer and has moved to his liver. 
He seems to be getting worse and worse, and that’s what the medical information is saying, but my parents don’t say anything other than “he’s good” and “this is the healthiest he’s been”.  They’re sort of using this intense positivity to cope, which I understand, but not knowing what’s happening with him and if there’s limited time is absolutely killing me. 
I’ve tried to have many heart to heart conversations with my mom about it, but she shuts me out and gets so angry when I even ask if he’s getting better/worse. They keep telling me that he’ll just do chemo indefinitely, but I know that’s not possible, and incredible devastating on the body. 
From the last talk we had and the information I got (re:liver tumours) and the type of care he is receiving, my mind is telling me he is palliative. This isn’t really a guess, but I don’t want to believe it either. 

My heart has honestly never felt so broken. Has anyone experienced anything like this?",2019-06-28 08:43:29

I’ve been sorting out the funeral arrangements and the council came round my mums house yesterday and said we have 3 weeks to sort her things out and be gone; suggesting that my brother and I present at homeless so we can get on the housing list (I am 26years old, my brother is 29). I asked what this involved and she told me that we would be out in temporary accommodation- no thanks. I’ve just lost my mum, had the worst Christmas and new year of my life and my mental health is seriously deteriorating and they expect us to go homeless?? 
The fact they’ve only given me 3 weeks to sort through my mums house which only gives me 2 weeks after the funeral to completely empty it ready for the next person. 
I haven’t even fully sorted the funeral out as my mum didn’t have insurance and it’s all been left to me to do. I keep feeling like I’m making huge mistakes all the time and I just want everything to be perfect.
My brothers aren’t of much help practically- my older brother who is 29 has autism and I’m his carer. My younger brother who is 24 has his own life 150 miles away (we are all really close and I wouldn’t dis my younger brother- he is going through a lot right now and is struggling and still needs to work).  I am blessed with good brothers who I consider my best friends, just we are all good at our own thing.

448,Husband just diagnosed,7,jj1w27,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/jj1w27/husband_just_diagnosed/,10,1603836876.0,"Hello everyone. My husband was just diagnosed last week. Two months ago, he started having pain in his back. When it got worse, we went to the doctor. They thought it might be a muscle strain and sent him to physical therapy.  It wasn't until last week that they discovered a fracture in his lower spine and the cancer. In addition to all this, he has COPD.

My daughter did some research and it is a treatable cancer with a good survivability rate, 60 to 80 percent. Assuming we can get on top of it and stay on top of it. But I still feel like he is going to die. 

I could deal with this news if he wasn't in so much pain. They finally put him on Oxycodone. I really hope it helps him. I've been told how strong I was to deal with this, but I don't feel strong. I just feel scared. 

We've been together for over 20 yrs. I keep wondering how I'm going to deal with it if he does die. How am I going to help my daughter? How will we survive financially? We have a little money from a settlement but it isn't going to last forever. Working from home is my only option right now, but I can't seem to find anything. So now I have to worry about how to promote myself on top of trying to help my husband get through each day. I have to not cry in front of my daughter because that will only scare her. Inwardly, I feel frantic and overwhelmed. Outwardly, I try to keep a positive outlook for the sake of both my daughter and my husband.

Yesterday he started choking on mere spit. I was terrified. I managed to get him on his side and he was able to breathe a little better. There's other things, little things, that also worry me. When he gets grouchy and snaps at me or our daughter because of the pain, I don't get mad at him, I know he can't help it and he immediately apologizes when he snaps at me or our daughter. That, I can handle. He's always been a kind of grouchy guy, but he's got a heart of gold. 

What I can't handle, is how affectionate he's been lately. Reaching out to touch my hand and tell me how much he loves me and how he couldn't get through this without the love and support of me and our daughter. It scares me because until the last few months, he's never been overly demonstrative like this. It makes me feel like he's giving up. Like he is going to die. 

I guess I'm not really asking for anyone to tell me it will be ok because nobody can guarantee that. I just have to fight harder to help him. I'm sorry for the long post, but all that nattering leads up to my actual question. Is there anything I can do to help ease the pain for him? Does anyone have any tips that might be helpful?",2020-10-27 22:14:36
449,I'm just so mad right now (Covid-19),8,jemlfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/jemlfd/im_just_so_mad_right_now_covid19/,1,1603217369.0,"My dad has extensive SCLC (lung cancer) and has just finished chemo, will receive immunotherapy for the rest of his life. His prognosis is pretty bad, with hopefully a year left. My mum is pretty weak herself and while she's never been diagnosed with a weaker immune system, whenever she does get sick, she gets sick *real bad*. Illnesses that are normally 'quite bad' have been known to nearly threaten her life, including the flu. She is in her sixties, my dad is 71.

Currently, we have a huge increase of Corona and so they tried to distance themselves from anyone and everyone by spending time in their holiday home, if only because, well, my dad doesn't have long to live and it's his reason to keep on going to treatments for now.

This places them quite close to my aunt (mum's sister) who lives in an extremely high risk region - and who seemed to not give a shit about the virus at all, mocking it, etc. Last week she had visited her new born grandchild and got pissy at her daughter-in-law because she had to wear a mask.

Either how, on Thursday or Friday, while I was on the phone with my mum, she tells me her sister is going to come by on Saturday. I instantly dislike it. But she assures me she'll try to be safe, keep distance, not touch a thing, etc. That she feels bad for telling her sister not to come 'because you know it'll just be a fight'. I get it, she's the only support, besides me, that my mum has with my dad being sick.

I wanted to push my mum to not let her come over. But I didn't. I just reiterated how to be safe. I tried to fool myself to believe I was just overreacting, and I should let my parents have at least this. Because *what are even the odds?!*

Yesterday, I'm on the phone with my mum. While my dad kept his distance, my mum actually drove around with her sister. My mum wore a mask, but her sister *didn't.* Inside I'm fuming, but I try not to lash out at my mum, I don't want her to feel guilty in case things do end up bad. I wanted to wait to scold her like she was my child, for real, but I also didn't want to make her feel guilty about what I consider to be just stupid behaviour, considering both my parents are high risk, in case they did get sick.

Today, my mum calls. Her sister is ill. Fever, headache, cough, the whole works. She's going to get tested. My parents won't, since we're running low on tests it's reserved for those with symptoms. My dad, as part of his treatment, does get tested next week (as everyone does before entering the hospital as a patient, even if just for a few hours), but having come into contact with a confirmed case is no longer a reason to test. There's also a backlog, so if it's a cold or covid - it could take up to 5 days to know. 

My aunt actually already had a headache on Saturday, wasn't feeling well and irritable. She still decided to come to my parents, while having so many risky contacts herself in what is the country's hot spot right now.

I'm so mad right now. Mad at myself, for not pressing my mum to not see her sister. Mad at my mum for sitting in a car with her. Mad at my aunt. Mad at everyone that just laughed it off.

I stand to be alone in the world. No siblings. No in-laws. No one. All because I couldn't push myself to get angry at my mum, to tell her she was being stupid, to call my aunt myself, to tell her I'd never forgive her.

And I don't think I ever will forgive my aunt if my parents do get sick. I don't know what will come of it, but right now all I can see is how I will be alone, alone if my parents are in the hospital, alone if one of them dies while the other is still in the hospital, alone if they both die. How I will have to care for their pets (dogs) as well as mine (cats) that don't mingle. Arrange everything. And how I won't have my dad to nag me, or my mum to help me.  How I won't even get to say goodbye. How, when they get home this weekend, I won't even be able to say hi, because the last thing any of us needs, is me sick as well. 

I know he's dying, I know he doesn't have much longer to live, but it shouldn't be due to this.

I'm sorry, I just had to tell someone how I felt.",2020-10-20 18:09:29
450,How to support my family,7,iv6xyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/iv6xyx/how_to_support_my_family/,2,1600467602.0,"I’m currently at home with my parents. My dad just found out he has cancer which seemed easily curable at first, but as of last night we found out the doctor told him the wrong results and it looks bad now. We don’t know yet if it’s spread or how far it’s spread, but in the meantime I’m wondering what I can do for them.

My parents didn’t really sleep last night and everything is heavy today. We have a week until we will find out more. What can I do for them? 

I typically try to lighten the mood in my family when required. My plan more or less is to feel things and be sincere when the mood requires it, but otherwise lighten the mood every good opportunity I get. I’m typically good at lightening moods, but I also want to show him I care. 

When we first found out he has cancer, I hugged him and we talked about how we’re going to get through it... now after we found out the actual results I’m unsure of how to approach things. He has always been so strong. But yesterday and today he is struggling to keep himself together. I never even talked to him about it yesterday. My mom told me the new results and he spent the day setting up appointments. Afterwards I tried to join him while he was working out but he left right after I joined. Then later on he had to lay down and was sick to his stomach from stress. I went out to get him some soup from a restaurant he likes, and we watched tv together at night. I’m almost apprehensive to hug him and be emotional with him because we typically have never been emotional with each other and I know he doesn’t like to seem weak. I feel that me being emotional with him might break him down, but at the same time I don’t want him to think I don’t care because I am trying to stay upbeat. I’m also afraid that maybe I am being insincere and just trying to protect myself by avoiding having an emotional moment with him.

454,Cancer diagnosis is destroying my relationship. Help.,8,imjena,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/imjena/cancer_diagnosis_is_destroying_my_relationship/,4,1599266552.0,"Hi all,

I tried posting this to relationship\_advice but no responses. Kind of expected, since it's such a specific situation. Not sure if this is allowed to be posted here, but I'm hoping this sub might be able to help.   

A few months ago, my partner (30M) was diagnosed with cancer. The stress has amplified communication problems that already existed in our relationship. There are overarching things like wondering if we have the same long term goals and dreams, as he’s very much a ‘live for today’ kind of person and I’m a future planner. However, our lives have been overshadowed by this diagnosis and the following things feel like the immediate issues:

\- Currently, he’s still healthy, living a pretty unaffected life by the disease (physically). He took a leave from work at the advice of his doctor, just to see how he reacts to treatment. He’s on immunotherapy so he’s been feeling great and hasn’t had any side effects. He spends his days doing outdoor activities and exploring areas nearby. This is great, but it’s left me with a lot of the ‘adult’ responsibilities. I do all the cleaning, most of the meal prep, grocery shopping, and anything else that falls under household chores. Sometimes he’ll start a project at the house, get bored halfway through, and just leave it. I’m left to clean up the aftermath or finish what was started. I want him to live his fullest life, but I feel like I’m more his mother than his partner right now. 

\- He’s very sensitive about talking about his disease/treatment. I recognize this might be how he’s coping, but he’s intentionally left me out of very important appointments when the doctor discusses test results and the path forward. When I ask for the details, I can see he gets agitated. From his perspective, he can’t see why I need every detail. From mine, having the details makes me feel more secure in this situation. We can’t seem to meet in the middle. 

\- He doesn’t understand my sadness through this. He has taken on an extremely positive attitude, but I have been struggling with an intense depression since the diagnosis. I’m seeing two counselors to get this under control, but some days, I am just so down. My partner doesn’t understand and only sees it as negativity, which he doesn’t want. It takes away my ‘safe space’ in him and puts a lot of pressure on me.

\- Sex has completely halted. Nothing intimate in the past 4 months. I would say we rarely kiss or touch anymore. The constant strain doesn’t make either of us feel like being intimate. Whenever I talk to him about it, he clams up. It’s like he doesn’t know what to say except ‘we’ll have sex tonight’ and then we just don’t... 

Honestly, that’s not everything, but I feel like those are the bigger problems and I have no idea how to solve them. Everything is a battle right now and I just keep waiting for us to come together like I read on cancer support forums. We’ve been together for a long time and I can’t envision a life without him. He’s been part of some of my most formative years and the thought of splitting up makes me feel lost. However, this honestly feels so loveless at this point, I’m not sure I can survive being this starved in a relationship. It’s causing a lot of unhappiness in both of us. Not only am I scared to be without him as a partner, but without him in general if treatment doesn’t work. I typically shy away from hard decisions in my life for the sake of staying ‘comfortable.’ It's safe to say , I don't like change, especially change I don't control. I think about the options we have, and I feel immense guilt going in either direction:

1. We remain in this relationship, and by some miracle, we end up getting through this rough patch. While we try to work through it, I will be worried and stressed thinking about possibly wasting whatever time he has left. 

2. We split up and I can’t cope without him. I continue to worry about him and his health, but now I’m even more removed from the details that provide me security. I’m also not sure I can look myself in the mirror knowing I left someone during the hardest part of their life. I will feel like a monster. 

I'm really hoping someone here might be able to identify with this and help me/us navigate the harshness of this situation. I feel cancer has stolen our lives and I am really angry about it. Recently I asked him if this whole diagnosis hadn’t happened, do you think we’d be in such dire straits? He told me no and it broke my heart. Life is fucking unfair. I’m sure he has a laundry list of things he’s unhappy about with me as well. I do recognize that. Should we continue on and fight through this emotional pain? Or move on, even though it's going to hurt like hell?  This is the most difficult thing I’ve ever gone through and I feel like I’m not equipped to make the tough decisions.

I know this makes me a garbage person, but sometimes I get mad at her, because she tells me she misses me. There’s gonna be a day, some time soon, when I’ll be the one missing her and there won’t be a damn thing I can do about it, because she won’t be here anymore.

I know, I know it’s not her fault that she is sick, and I should spend as much time with her as possible. But my anxiety is through the roof with the tought of loosing her, and I just don’t know how to be around her. I just don’t know how to deal.",2020-09-03 02:59:18

So they told me they removed the cancerous tumor and I was fine now. I’ll be fine and I just have to go in for a scan every few months.

I live in France and my parents live in Italy, I came last week to visit after a long period without seeing them because of the lockdown.


My dad has liver problems and hemochromatosis so his blood is taken and cheked regularly. A couple of weeks ago he had a screening and apparently a lot of values were off scale, he had an exam and they found a tumor in his liver.
I took him to the hospital on Wednesday, I wasn't inside and I just have a report of what my mom said: it is in a position where is almost impossible to operate, it has already spread a little, they are planning a therapy and meanwhile we'll see a surgeon next week to have his opinion.
My parents are both devastated and I'm scared as hell.


They've spent all their life smoking and trying to stop without much result, I thought after the news they would have at least tried to reduce. I was so wrong. 
They both usually start smoking at 9am and continue no-stop till late evening. I've talked to my mum yesterday, she said she knows they should smoke less, expecially now. Today it was like we never had that talk.
This evening after dinner my father smoked a cigarette, I didn't say anything. Just about 5 minutes after that, he had another one. When he tried to light up the third one in a row I had to tell him not to. Well, not even 5 minutes after that my mom tried to light up another one too. I feel like I have to scold them like children.

Though today I’m finding it hard to be constantly positive about something that is really affecting his quality of life. Pancreatic cancer seems like such a crap diagnosis whatever the stage or treatment. 

My Grandad also died from a heart attack two weeks ago today, it came as such a shock. I have been so worried about my Dad that I never even thought it would be my Grandad that would be the one to go - he seemed in such good health. I really still can’t come to terms that he has gone. 

The loss of my Grandad has also exacerbated my anxiety about my Dad. Life’s is so precious and short. I’m worried about COVID, serious side effects of his treatment, or recurrence of the cancer.

Grandad’s passing and dads diagnosis has all happened so quickly and all during lockdown. I’m just gutted and not sure I can take anymore bad news. I really need Dad to get better :( I hate seeing him go through this, I wish I could take all his pain away.

My mother has Stage 4 Lymphoma and it has already gone terminal. It has spread all over her body and now she is experiencing immense pain. It is extremely hard to watch. We can't do anything but to give her painkillers. I'm just 19, all throughout childhood, I had watch how my family became broken with so much anger and hatred due to my parents' marriage. My mom directed her anger at my brother and I which has deeply damaged us mentally however, I understood why she did it and beared with it. Even if I found it so unfair but I can't do anything about her own character. I know that she still loves me and I still love her despite everything that has happened in my life. We don't have a proper mother and daughter relationship due to a language barrier which caused misunderstandings as well as my mom's dictator like personality. However, I still have respect for her because I know how much she has sacrificed for her family. I knew she herself is dealing with alot like me and my brother. But then, she has cancer for 3 years and when I just recieved the news, I was devastated. She didn't deserve this! I just don't understand why she had it in the first place. I begin to think that we were cursed and that we deserved it. I became less religious when I was younger due to my troubled childhood, and to me, I think God is just a creator and doesn't perform any miracles. You need to earn it through your own hard work and if miracles did happen to you, I merely thought it was just coincidence and luck. Please don't preach at me. I don't need anybody to talk to me about God. I have people coming up to me and tell me that it could be karma. It could be. But I don't want to think about it. I just hoped that my mother would be there for my wedding and meet her future children but that wouldn't be possible.
I feel like what's the point in all this. Is it to test me on how strong I am? Well I've lost and you won whoever is messing up with my life.

My mom got lung cancer, a very agressive form of lung cancer called small-cell carcinoma, you cannot cure from it and it's cause by smoking almost at 100%.
My mom used to smoke a lot and started at a very young age.
I don't know how it works in the States but in France the government taxes cigarettes a lot and makes a lot of profit out of it. They pretend to care with useless measures like increasing the price every year but every specialist will confirm that IT DOESN'T WORK. So do they really want people to stop? Of course they don't.
We have a great Healthcare system but this issue isn't taken seriously like other addictions, it's normalized and it shouldn't.
Anyone would be uncomfortable next to someone taking cocain right? It should be the same with smoking (especially since smoking is also dangerous for people around).
Nicotine is as addictive as heroin studies found, so what are we waiting for?

Thank you for reading me and if you smoke, please try getting helped, you can do it.


Edit : When my mom started smoking, there were adds on TV, they even said smoking was good for your health. I don't judge people that smoke because they are sick, they have an addiction and they should be treated as such no matter what reason led them to smoke.",2020-07-02 07:20:28

This is my first time posting, I think I just need to type out everything going on in my head to organize my thoughts a little.

My mom (58) was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer back in March. At that time, she didn't really have any symptoms but went to her doctor after she asked me to look at a lump in her abdomen (I'm a new graduate nurse so no expert but people still tend to ask me for medical advice, haha). I'm 21 and I was just finishing up my last semester of college. I came home for break and saw her in April, she was her normal self, only symptoms being a little bit of nausea and stomach aches.

I just returned home after graduating and finishing up my last few shifts as a nursing assistant at a hospital in my college town. She's currently in the hospital, being discharged tomorrow. She was unrecognizable. I think that my sister tried to downplay how bad it had gotten to save my feelings, but now I feel as though I wasted these last few months without her. She was lethargic and disoriented, her speech is slurred to where she can hardly speak. She didn't know who I was when I entered the room, she thought I was my sister for a little bit, and then thought I was her nurse. She won't eat anything and is in and out of sleep all day and all night.

I think I'm having a lot of anticipatory grief. It's frustrating because it makes it so hard to enjoy the time I have with her when it's all I can do not to cry when I see her. I'm scared. I don't know how to do any of this. I thought I would have so much more time with her.

After my parents divorced, she started to date a man who abused my sister and me. She didn't believe us when we told her. Eventually, my dad found out and her boyfriend went to prison, but before he went she married him and spent a long time trying to make my sister and me admit that we had lied (which, of course, we hadn't). She eventually came around but this very damaging to my relationship with her, and it all got kind of swept under the rug and we don't really speak about it. I knew she was still my mom and that she loved me and I planned to have that conversation and forgive her one day, but I thought it would be years from now. I couldn't talk about any of that with her now even if I decided I wanted to, I don't think she would be able to.

My parents are in Sydney, Australia while I’m in London. I wanted to be there, but with work and travel restrictions, I had to stay put. I’m not sure if it was because I was in shock and things hadn’t fully sunk in, but it was weirdly easy for me to accept that there was nothing I could do, though I knew I would get to her eventually.

Now it’s months later and I’m seeing the effect chemo is having on her. I no longer feel okay with not being there. I need to be with her, but it seems harder than ever. Though cases of the coronavirus have lessened, Australia still has strict travel restrictions in place. The 20+ hour flight from London to Sydney still doesn’t feel like the most sensible thing to do right now, and I would need to quarantine in a hotel for two weeks upon my arrival before I could even think about seeing my mum. I’m not even sure if work would let me leave for that long, and what if there’s still a risk I could get her sick?

The guilt and worry is making it hard for me to focus on anything else. While it’s very likely she’ll be fine, what if she isn’t, and I have to live with the regret of not being there for her?

The only symptom he had before his diagnosis was decreased mental clarity and increased memory loss, but this developed very gradually over the course of like 2 years before he decided to get it checked out. now that he has been through radiation and is starting chemo, however, he is like a totally different person.

He was on high dose steroids for a few weeks, which sent him into a full-blown psychosis that made it impossible for him to stay at home because he was so aggressive with his immediate family (me, . he’s been staying with his sister about an hour away and since then his psychosis symptoms have slowly decreased, but now the chemo has him lethargic, nauseous to the point of not being able to eat at all, and he’s very depressed.

It was stage three and the doctors told us to jump on it immediately to stop its progression so she could hopefully stop it from going into stage 4. Seeing her go through surgery, being in hospital beds with tubes and wires connected to her, hearing her break down crying saying she didn’t want to die and leave me, not being able to walk or sit up from pain. It broke me. She’s the strongest person I know. Breadwinner of our home & basically my only real caregiver because my father never really stepped up. 

She completed chemo a few months back. I knew it wasn’t time for celebration, but we did anyway. One small victory. She developed neuropathy which was debilitating for her, since she was an active runner and overall health enthusiast. The woman has run marathons. She could barely walk a mile without her feet swelling and it killed her. She didn’t feel like the same person anymore. She keeps a positive attitude through it all and is the one person who makes me cry with laughter almost everyday.

Today we found out that the cancer has not only come back but spread to her lungs and liver. She’s terrified. My brother (28M) and I (21F) are devastated. The bond I have with my mom is indescribable. I truly believe she’s one of my soulmates. We finish each others sentences. I’ve never spent more than 3 days away from her in my life. No matter what kind of day I have, I can count on her being on the couch laughing at my shitty jokes at the end of it. Wiping away my tears after a boy breaks my heart. I can tell her absolutely anything without backlash or judgement. She’s the only person I’ve ever felt that truly gets me, and I might lose her. I’m at a loss for words, I know you’re supposed to keep your head up & stay positive but I’m shattered on the inside. I can’t imagine my life without her, I don’t want to. I don’t feel like I’ve had enough time with her. 

Nothings over yet and she’s determined to fight but times like these feel so unfair. Her whole life she’s done nothing but help and care for others, and she always seems to get the short end of the stick. I’m not angry at the world or at God, but it breaks my heart knowing how truly amazing this being is and how little life gave her. She has her children who stand by her through everything but that’s it. Her family is only us and my grandparents. The struggles and hardships she’s had to go through have been immense. To end it all off with a disease eating away at her seems so cruel. I don’t want to see her sick, skinny and pale with tubes hooked up to her.

I’m her only child and unfortunately I live in LA and she’s in Georgia....and we’re in the middle of a global pandemic with hotspots in our respective cities.

I desperately want to be with her when she passes. I want to be able to hold her hand, comfort her, and advocate for her care. The amount of guilt I would feel if I wasn’t there would be unbearable and haunt me for the rest of my life. The last I spoke with her yesterday, she did not know who I was and was unable to communicate.

What would you do in this situation? 

Should I risk my own health and hers/others by flying or driving from LA to ATL to be with her? I have no symptoms of covid and have not left my apartment in 16+ days.

I have one paper mask, a box of gloves, and antibacterial wipes to keep me safe while I travel.

492,Corona lockdown isolating my dad,7,fita6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/fita6e/corona_lockdown_isolating_my_dad/,5,1584263698.0,"So dad got cancer on his vocal chords.. been dealing with it for years now, cutting away small tumors now and then.. but always growing back after a while, so doc decided it was time for radiation therapy to try and kill it off for good. 

Fair enough, he's in good spirit, as it haven't really spread at all over the years, nor has he had any sideeffects other than a raspy voice when it came back. Just keeps coming back in the same general area. Thing is, his cancer doc is in another city, a short flight away from home. That's where the expertise is. Dad is also getting kinda forgetful. Ditzy I guess, is the word. And his sense of direction is on par with a kitten on ketamine. And his age, being single, he gets pretty lonely as well. So I've travelled with him for about 99% of the time, my brother in law stepped in once when I had to work. 

So back to now, his radiation therapy is a total six weeks, five weeks left now.. and this morning we got the call that they are kicking everyone not a patient out of the hotel connected to the hospital. Because of corona. So my sister that was taking over for me as I have to work next week, ends up at another hotel, and won't even be allowed access to where he is staying without his doc producing a document for it come Monday.. 

So I'm naturally worried as hell about his mental health. Since he got cancer to begin with years ago, he's never had to deal with it alone, or sit alone in his hotel room all day with no human contact. The mind start thinking dark thoughts easily when you feel all alone. 

I don't get the hospitals logic in all this. His legal companion mandated by his doctor, living at public Hotel, having to encounter random people, and take the bus to come meet him and follow him to treatments, is supposed to decrease risk of Covid-19 infection? And him having to leave the hotel to be social with his own daughter and have some human contact. I.e. potentially exposing himself to infected people, to not go mad by loneliness. 

If the doc don't signs a paper saying she can stay at the hotel with him on Monday I'm gonna let my nice guy mask slip and unleash god damn hellfire. It's inhuman to basically let a cancer patient be with no proper emotional support for 5 weeks, when the only other choice is to expose himself to potential Covid-19.

He has prostate cancer that has turned into bone cancer and also has congestive heart failure. He doesn't sleep much ever. The nights are especially difficult and requires someone to be awake all night because of how much he twitches himself awake. This lack of sleep makes him especially nasty, and he says extremely hurtful things.

What makes this especially hard, is until this past Christmas day, he hid most of this diagnosis from us - he has had this cancer for about 3 and half years. 

I have family members that have lost their absolute shit on him due to lack of sleep and his extremely insensitive comments.

All we want to do is help, but it feels like the more we help the more he gives up on bettering his situation.

He refuses to believe what the doctors say and he believes everyone is ""out to get him"". He lies to his doctors about his symptoms and pain and puts on a show whenever nurses are around.

I am just at my wits end. I just needed to vent, i feel so helpless and comforting him and speaking to him calmly and quietly doesnt seems to be helping.

It turns out what they thought was a cyst, is the cancer. We also found out today the cancer is not only in his knee but his ankle, foot, his lower thigh above the knee and on a rib, all on his left side. 
I’m not sure if the shock will ever wear off. We’re still waiting on pathology to know what kind it is and what stage, so it feels like a version of limbo hell. He’s 30 (will be 31 this year) and I’m about to turn 28 in a week, so the thought of this happening is beyond comprehensible still... especially with how healthy he normally eats, RARELY drinks, doesn’t smoke. I just don’t understand. 
We also have a 3 year old, who is such a daddy’s girl. Part of me is so scared of all of the unknown but I’m also trying to stay positive that everything will turn out okay. 
He was working full-time as a police officer and got injured on duty and is currently out on paid leave from the surgery they “accidentally” found the cancer during. Very long story of how this all came about). But I’m worried about finances once that leave is over and treatments start (no idea what that’ll be either yet).
I do work but I don’t make nearly enough to compensate for his salary. I had plans to go back to school once our daughter was in school herself, we both it would be easier that way just considering how crazy his schedule could be. My current job was just great being so flexible so at least one of us could be there more for our daughter and covers odds and ins bills; utilities, car payments, groceries, and whatever else I could help with. 
He said there’s ways to get financial help if we need it, some others that have gone through this have given him the details. I feel like I need to get a different job, one that pays more anyways. But then I’m worried I won’t be there enough to help him and take care our daughter. I’m also not sure what job I would get to cover bills, would I have to get two? Would that even be possible to work two AND take care of everyone? 
My parents have assured us they’ll help with anything financially but I don’t want to put that on them. They already do so much for us as far as watching our daughter when we’re at work. 
This is where I’m kicking myself in the ass for being so indecisive in the past and not picking a major to stick with to finish school. 
I just want to do anything I can to help but I don’t even know where to start. He can’t walk on his own at all without crutches because of the incision healing and extreme leg pain so I’m waiting on him 24/7, which I don’t mind at all because he needs the help around the house. 
My mind is in a million places, more like panic mode. If there’s other family support apps or websites, I’d love to know them. 
I’m not a mentally strong person, I can fully admit that. I can put on a good front and be that rock for others but i know I’m going to be tested through all of this. 

We do have support from family members and his coworkers have been reaching out to him, along with others who have gone through treatment themselves. 
My mom keeps reminding me to take care of myself too, but I’m not sure I know how to on top of all of this.    The people pleaser in me would rather take care of those around me first, than myself. 
So maybe any advice on how to keep my stress levels down would be good. 
Any advice in general ... on anything would be helpful. 

Typing all my thoughts out here helped ease my emotions, I know people blog about these situations but I feel like most of mine would be a long ramble like everything above.",2020-03-07 13:01:20

A ""friend"" called me and asked if my grown & flown daughter was visiting for the holidays. 

And from this friends tone, I felt the need to justify why my daughter wouldn't be visiting on Thanksgiving Day. I told all kinds of personal information that she shouldn't even be privy, too. I have done extensive work in boundaries however forget everything I learned when talking with her. I am in counseling and have been for most of my adult life. Her life is pretty unrelatable to mine so we have very little in common. Why is it I have this stupid need to justify myself???

I don't do it with anyone else and I am going for try a new strategy in the future. I am grieving that our friendship is a surface one that will never be the same unless she either begins to show compassion in a different way or has a similar lifechanging diagnosis which I don't wish on anyone. She was one of those friends who made my cancer about her 🙄 and that's why I have distanced myself.

I wish I could figure out why I have allowed her to make me feel as if I need to explain me, my life or life decisions to her even though I barely talk with her!!!!

Six months after that I started having infrequent lightning pains on that side of my scalp. About a year after that my eyebrow stopped working. About a year ago the entire right side of my face went completely numb and now I look kind of crazy when I smile.

unfortunately I've been out of work for several months and got Medicaid. I wasn't planning on using it only in the case of like getting in a car accident or something. However about a month ago my IUD was about 6 months expired and really bothering me so I decided to use my Medicaid to get my birth control switched. The nurse practitioner I met with suggested we might as well investigate the facial numbness since I didn't have any co-pays. I felt guilty about using the Medicaid but proceeded. Blood test rule out a stroke. ENT ruled out fluid in the ear blocking the nerve. I have a brain scan next Friday and I'm absolutely terrified. I apologize for how selfish this sounds because they don't actually have a diagnosis. I know many of you are struggling with something concrete and something that affects you and your loved ones every day. My only family are my paternal grandparents and they're in their eighties. I just got two job offers this last week and I plan to take one of them starting on December 9th and I hope to have real insurance in January.

I think I've been ignoring it this long because the idea of getting a prognosis and having to go through it alone is incredibly terrifying. Not necessarily afraid to die or afraid of treatments, but once we figure out what it is... I don't know I don't have the words. I'll have to work with my new employer for at least a year before I qualify for FMLA. I think overall if I had to just pick one thing I'm scared about it's what if we find out what it is and I can't afford to get treatment. The whole pity party of the answer is right there but you can't have it because you make 60k a year, have student loan debt in a condo, and no one to pitch in financially just feels so empty and lonely.

So about a month ago I posted about my momma being diagnosed with early stage breast cancer. The initial tests showed two miniscule tumors in her right breast, requiring a lumpectomy to remove, and radiation to reduce the chance of future issues. 

Well she had an MRI last Friday that resulted in three new lumps being located (one in right breast, two in left breast) and worrisome spots in her lymph nodes. Her surgeon has reduced her survival chance from 99% to about 50% at most, based on the MRI results. But we won't know more until the biopsies on these newly found masses come back in about a week. I'm sure he's just preparing us for the worst possible outcome, but I'm absolutely terrified. I know we can't possibly know for sure until the testing is completed, but the fact that her surgeon is genuinely worried makes me sick to my stomach. 

I don't want to lose my mom. I just lost my gramma unexpectedly last May, and my papa is currently in hospital for heart failure.

When I first heard about my dads cancer I knew I had to be their for my mum and do everything I can to help her round the house. To me this was the most important in helping others who may be more emotional than me e.g my mum
However I put in this strong face for my mum and all friends acting like I was completely fine and nothing was wrong, but at nights I would see myself cry a little and just think about the worst. That brings me to my first point, try to not think about the worst, it’ll only make you feel worse about yourself and the situation. 
I never spoke to anyone about my dads cancer, and I wish I did, even if it’s a small comment on how they are  doing or letting everything out to someone close to you, it will make you feel better, trust me. 
I was luckily enough that my gf was always there for me to talk to it about whenever I needed to when I was at my lowest points, find someone like that in which you can let ya feelings out to and be comforted by them.
Here’s a few things I learnt to help you get through the situation: 
1. Just cause your a boy does not mean you should not have feelings, it makes you more of a man to express them, even a little bit 
2. You are not alone, if you don’t feel comfortable in talking to a person in real life, Reddit is a great place to tell you story and feeing so others can help you
3. Your family is always there if you need help to get through it
4. But do stay strong for the people who need you, they will appreciate it and that might make you feel better about yourself
5. Don’t treat the person with cancer any different to before, they want to be seen as the Same person as before, which they are
6. When it’s all over it is worth the pain everyone wen through, trust me

Even if no one sees this I’m glad I got this off of my chest, even tho it’s over for me and my dad, it’s starting for millions of people around the world and I hope this can help someone out there ",2019-01-02 08:10:23

First.. this is the least of my worries and I feel this question is so trite, but I have no idea what to do.  

Here’s my question: how do I tell this amazing guy I’ve gone on 4 dates with that my mother has cancer and I’m living back at home helping her.

Backstory-

I’ve been living at home going back to school for a new career for the last year. In the past few months my mother was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. She’s on immunotherapy so things have been going really well. I took time off dating cuz I was living at home. Now that my mom was diagnosed with cancer I decided life’s too short to set limitations for when I’m ready to date. About 2 weeks ago I went on a date with this amazing guy. The relationship has progressed slowly but fast in a short amount of time (FYI just kissing ;-) ) I feel horrible hiding this important part of my life and I don’t want to hide this information anymore. The good news he does work in the medical field so I’m hoping he’ll understand. I just don’t know how to lay down the information.. “hey I’m living with my parents and my mother has cancer”

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thank You",2018-12-31 07:32:21

I cant honestly say I'm alright, this experience is teaching me what  I'm capable under *duress*, but acknowledging the emotion difficulties kind of temporarily rips me apart, as its something I dont have the luxury of really doing right now. 

Regardless, I'm waaaaaay better at listening then talking, and through everything I've learned the horror of sitting alone wanting,*needing*  some way to... I dont know, let it out? or at least not feel what your feeling alone...

If any of you ever need to talk, I don't care who, where, what or why, send me a message. 
I'm always available, always logged in, and honestly... It may help just as much as you.

Cancer sucks, and at this point Every ounce of my fiber and being is focused on taking care of my mom, dad, and sister. I've temporarily becom a stronger person that I could have ever imagined, but I cant even begin to calculate the costs and toll... I'm young (23), but its getting harder and harder to envision the reality beyond this.. I'm shucking more and more sanity angrily out the window to make room for the willpower to smile as I walk into work, to tell my mother shes going to be alright when she calls crying from nightmares.

 I have friends, and family, but I cant let them in on how dark the world is right now. They need me to be strong, and I wont let them down.  I'm doing this almost alone and almost always blind, save the nights I get to much screen time before bed and get stuck just awake enough to start thinking...

&nbsp;

Dont be me.. I didn't mean for it to get dramatic and dark... but if you need someone to talk to, hit me (or anyone you feel you can) up. It doesn't need to be about struggles, sometimes its good to just have a normal conversation that doesn't make you recap everything.",2016-04-15 04:54:09

TLDR; my dad’s long-standing terminal illness has deeply affected family dynamics and exacerbated mental health issues among caregivers, it’s come to a boiling point where caregivers are impaired when we are needed the most  - help !! 

—

My dad’s lived with cancer since I was 9; I am now 29. Over the past couple of years the cancer has metastasised and was kept under control with chemo, but now we are in the final phase with one last treatment that will give him a couple of months. That treatment has been paused due to a very major abdominal surgery and pneumonia in the past couple of months; he has been in and out of hospital three times in the last three to four weeks. It’s been insane to say the least. At one point during the abdominal surgery we thought that was goodbye.

Me and my Sister share caregiving duties with my mum, who is accustomed to being his primary caregiver since we were children. In times of extreme stress (when my dad is manifestly ill), my mum shows signs of extreme burnout — obsessive compulsive behaviour, severe mood swings, irritability, feeling criticised all the time. As much as I try to take the load off of her and give her time to recuperate, she insists on doing caregiving duties, sometimes in excess and to little effectiveness. This morning she forgot to give my dad his medication (it was only an hour late), but it seemed to trigger a spiral of controlling behaviour. 

My Sister recently developed a fear of choking and swallowing that I surmise has stemmed from the intense stress and anxiety of this time. In the past couple of weeks she has had to slowly eat one long meal a day composed of very soft foods. She’s even had to supplement her diet with the nutritional drinks my dad is supposed to take. We have gotten her throat checked out (fine) and arranged for psych and Counselling services. She however, seems to lack initiative, and drags her feet on calling numbers and even taking her medication (she recently developed an upper respiratory tract infection). 

My mum is spiralling because now both my Sister and my dad are ill - my dad with his terminal illness and pneumonia complication, my sis with her anxiety and it’s manifestation, as well as her recent infection. She reacts to this by being intrusive and controlling, berating my Sister, becomes reactive to the sound of her coughing in her room, emotionally dumping on me all the time (even when I draw a line - she doesn’t hear it / she can only hear the din of her chaotic emotions), randomly and dramatically doing things like fishing out a weighing scale and asking me if it’s a good thing to get my Sister to see her weight right now (as though it will “scare her” into doing... what exactly? Eating more? She’s already improving in her intake...) just last night things got so bad I had to pass her a counselling emergency helpline to call. It seemed to calm her down. This morning it’s like the conversation never happened and she began doing all those things again. I’m not sure exactly what brought it on other than a sense of lack of control when she forgot my farher’s medication — it’s like her world sifts dramatically all the time. I suspect my mum has had undiagnosed and untreated mental health issues on top of her caregiver stress, and the combination is not pretty. It actually makes recovery and healing at home very disruptive and disorganised. Before my dad’s most recent prognosis, this tended to be the dynamic in the family too. Home was a contradictory mix of safety, imagination, love, high emotionality, outbursts, stress, intrusive behaviour and poor boundaries. In the past this has escalated into some very bad periods, including a time when my mum pressured my sister to give up a place as a very prestigious university when she showed adjustment issues, to study locally instead; it seemed that she did that to “resolve” the “problem” and minimise the stress in her vicinity. Growing up, this lead me to engage in pleasing behaviours and complete tearaway behaviour when I wanted to get away from feeling engulfed by the family (it also resulted in feeling extreme guilt in not spending more time with my dad, which comes and goes).

I’m trying my best to arrange schedules, deal with my dad and sis in a calmer, more persuasive way. I’ve been seeing a counsellor since July as I realised I needed help during this time. This counsellor made me much more aware of some of the consequences of the highly involved / poor boundary dynamic my family has. My mum doesn’t seem to realise that one of the main things she has to deal with at the moment is her mental health. Some advice will be appreciated. At the moment I do not know what to do besides taking over caregiving duties myself and getting a nurse to do home visits to help. However, my mum’s mental instability, and the legacy of that in my family (in me and my Sister) still remains an issue. Thanks a lot.

540,Heading to the end,5,j6qold,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/j6qold/heading_to_the_end/,2,1602105608.0,"My dad was diagnosed a little over two years ago with Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer. He has been fighting the good fight ever since. He started the most aggressive form of chemo, folfirinox, which we saw almost immediate results. His cancer markers went down but not without lots of hardship. The first few months he lost a significant amount of weight, his hair all fell out, he was sick most of the time and slept more than he was awake. Thankfully, he has an amazing oncologist who was able to adjust his dose and after some trial and error they found a regime that provided quality of life and also fought the cancer. His markers went down to under 100 and he was feeling great. He even traveled across the country to visit me. 

That was two years ago. 

The last month has been incredibly difficult. Essentially the cancer mutated and stop responding to the treatment. His markers are so high that they can't even be measured (over 20,000).  He has been experiencing horrible pain in his legs and hips but the doctor has no idea from what. This week he got a PET scan which actually showed the tumors are stable and the scan looks better than the original but the numbers are so high they don't know what to do. They are scheduling a MRI to check if there is some sort of nerve issue unrelated to the cancer or if in fact it is a weird side effect of the chemo or cancer itself. He lives in Colorado so he is able to treat pain with CBD and THC is on a very specific treatment plan involving RSOs as an alternative form of treatment and pain management. Our oncologist is starting to lose hope, in his last appointment I could tell he was trying everything to avoid saying hospice. 

I work freelance so luckily I am able to pick up and leave to go home to be with my family and help my parents. I want to get some time with him before it gets worse. We are hoping that if we continue with the current chemo and figure out what is causing the pain we can get him back on track. I feel half hopeful and half in complete despair. I love my dad and I don't want to lose him. I also don't want to watch him be in so much pain. I was looking from photos from before his treatment and he is a different person, to be honest everyone is my family is a different person. Not to be selfish but this has been incredibly hard on the rest of the family too. I live across the country without a partner working on my career trying to move that forward while having this in the back of my mind dictating every decision I make in case I have to quit and leave early. I have been lucky enough that I can travel home quite often and be there for most of the important things. But I am so exhausted, my family is so exhausted, my dad is so exhausted. I just want him to be cured but I know that won't happen. I feel like there is nowhere to turn, hence why I posted here. My friends are not yet at the point in their lives where they have lost a parent so it feels so isolating. I just needed to get some of this out and this seemed like the place so thank you.

Anyway, this is the story of my Grubhub fiasco today, COVID, my parents and cancer, and me trying to handle stressful situations. It starts with my parents; they're terrified of COVID. They're both cancer survivors in their late 60s/early 70s who are constantly vigilant and afraid of germs, even before COVID. Then COVID comes and their world shrinks. I abandon my apartment across the state to stay with them back in March so I could help out around the house during COVID. March passes as we start adapting to the life at home. Then April comes and my dad discovers he has a new form of lymphoma, potentially more severe than his leukemia 11 years ago. So he starts a 15-week intensive chemotherapy treatment. Meanwhile I'm staying with them, working a full-time job from their house, and trying to provide emotional support and caretaking as much as I can.

The last few months were just overwhelming, with so many challenges that I won't get into here. The hardest of it all was dealing with the reality of my dad's mortality. I was 9 years old when my mom first got cancer, then 19 years old when my dad got leukemia, and now I'm 30. When I was younger I couldn't grasp the magnitude or the reality of their cancer diagnoses; part of me just had this naive, impenetrable hope that everything would work out -- that it had to work out because I needed it to. Then this time around I started facing all the realities: the reality that my dad might die soon, that my mom might be left alone in a big house without friends or family nearby, and that my younger sister, halfway across the country will be devastated. Memories came flooding back of my childhood, especially the depression I suffered during my dad's first cancer treatment because it was too much for me to process. At the same time I'm now going to therapy after the dissolution of my 5 year relationship. I cried so much these last few months and mustered all my energy to try to be strong enough so I could support my parents.

Then two weeks ago we finally get good news. My dad had a PET scan and there's no remaining sign of his tumor -- it's the best possible result from his treatment. It's felt like a huge relief for everyone, and my dad's energy is returning. We don't know what the future holds but we finally had this victory after months of challenging times. Which brings us to today, and this stupid Grubhub story.

Since March, my parents have home-cooked every meal because they're terrified of COVID. My mom dislikes cooking and my dad is too exhausted to make anything for himself, so I try to cook some tasty food for them. Finally this week I asked my dad if he's up for delivery/takeout sometime. I could tell it brought up anxiety for him, but I felt like everyone was craving takeout after eating the same home-cooked food for 5 months straight. So today I order Grubhub for the first time and we excitedly all want mole enchiladas from our favorite mexican restaurant. The food delivery arrives, then two minutes later I open up the bags and find that over half of my order is missing. I spend the next 30 minutes on Grubhub customer support, texting the delivery driver, calling the restaurant, arguing to get a refund because Grubhub is trying to nickel-and-dime me. Meanwhile my parents are getting stressed out because I'm angry. I finally reorder more food from the restaurant and drive 30 minutes to pick up the food. Then I tell the waitress how frustrated I was with this, but she's young and she can't understand why this dinner means so much to me. And I don't want to have a long conversation with strangers due to COVID.

I get home, eat my mole enchilada, and then start sobbing in my room trying to figure out why I got so emotional about this stupid Grubhub issue. I just wanted this to go smoothly, to show my parents that it's OK to order takeout or delivery sometimes, that the world is adjusting to COVID and that things are alright. Looking back, this one dinner wasn't a big deal but it brought up all these feelings from the last 5 months.

If you made it this far, then thanks for reading. My heart goes out to everyone dealing with cancer or other illnesses during this time. I just felt like I had to write up my story because it's been bubbling inside me. With Love - C",2020-09-04 13:13:36

547,Need Help Understanding 😰,6,icrlci,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/icrlci/need_help_understanding/,5,1597885236.0,"I'm not going through cancer, but my partner is. He just barely started chemotherapy but has already decided to quit and I can't wrap my brain around this. 

So in early June he was rushed to the hospital, he had a perforated colon. Surgery removed a section of colon, he got what is supposed to be a temporary colostomy bag. It was discovered during surgery that he had colon cancer. The tumor was completely removed by the surgery. Tests showed that some stray cancer cells remained in his body, som chemo was scheduled. The plan has been to go through 12 chemo sessions, then he could have his colon reconnected and lose the colostomy bag. The oncologist has told him numerous times how lucky he was that the tumor was removed, and that the chemotherapy is to try to eradicate the trace amount of cells left over. In fact, his chemo is considered a really light chemo - minimal side effects, no expected nausea, no expected hair loss. All in all, I would think millions of cancer patients would love to be as set up for success as he is. 

He had his first session 2 weeks ago and was perfectly fine through it, absolutely no side effects. He has been really positive and upbeat about it all looking forward to breezing through and losing the colostomy bag. Today is supposed to be session 2, but his blood test yesterday showed his white blood cell count was a little too low and that they'd need to bring that back up before chemo can resume. That sent him completely into an angry rage and is calling up all the medical team saying he wants to quit. He says he isn't going to deal with any setbacks, even minor ones, and if there are factors that can cause unexpected delays, he'd rather just die from cancer than to deal with what he now considers ""being jerked around"". 


This is completely irrational to watch, and I don't know how to calm him down and see the big picture. His attitude literally flipped a 180 at the drop of a hat.",2020-08-20 01:00:36

i just feel i don't want to be in contact with anyone...i think because i feel upset they don't understand my concerns, though almost impossible for them to do... for instance, i am concerned about being left in my home, after my mothers death, to live alone for a few months (possibly as i sell the house and relocate) and without much outside contact or support from my blood family. my blood family has shown me little emotional support so far and they are the only ones living near me where i am with my mother. i am afraid of the mental toll it will take on me from thereon...and how i will resurface or recover alone, without the physical presence or encouragement of others. the task to overcome and reorder my life on my own felt so daunting a day ago, i heavily considered suicide to be the only release from intense mental pain; i'm attempting to set up a therapist appointment by the end of the month to address my desired disconnection and further alienation from people who care about me, and are attempting to be there for me in some form, but feel failed by...

have you felt this anger towards outsider's obliviousness? i'm not sure how to work with it. i think i have had a history of disowning friends suddenly, i want to work on this with a therapist too, but i just really feel almost nothing/indifference to these friends i loved DEARLY months earlier. i don't really know what to do with those feelings as i almost want to cut contact. i DO think it's important to have relationships and support is so, so important. but i don't feel supported by them, and i don't feel necessarily that they can support me, in whatever way i am subconsciously desiring.

Having a hard time to cope with the distance.",6,i2935b,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/i2935b/my_m31_dad_m60_was_diagnosed_with_stage_4/,3,1596387554.0,"Hi Everyone.

I apologize in advance for what might become quite the wall of text, for any mistakes (as English isn't my native language) and for the possible rambling.

I've put a **TLDR;** at the bottom as well, just in case this turns out a bit too confusion.

Just to give a bit of a background- My dad currently lives in the states (After emigrating in his mid 20's from the states to where I currently live, marrying twice, having me from the first marriage, divorcing and then 3 other kids from his 2nd marriage \[All pre to mid teens now\], and emigrating back to the states after living here for around 30 years), I was born & raised here and at the time of his return to the states (around 6 years ago) I've already built a life & a career for my self here which is why I stayed here.

After his diagnosis this past September, during which he was also diagnosed as pre-diabetic. My Fiancee( now wife) and I booked flights and visited him and the rest of the family for two weeks around December.

Up until that point he's had a biopsy for the initial diagnosis (Which was taken from his back), and right before our visit he had another biopsy to check his lymph nodes which sadly came back positive.

During our visit my dad was just starting his immunology treatments, and was working from home. Other than the fact he lost some weight (Due to his dietary changes to avoid his pre-diabetic state) he seemed in relatively good shape, even if he seemed a bit down emotionally speaking.

We spent our visit helping his wife with her business (She runs a boutique bakery from home), spent some quality time with my siblings and brought them all some much needed breathing room.

After returning from our visit we've tried to stay in touch as much as possible, plans were made and approved with the doctors to make sure the treatments were scheduled around our wedding (Which was held this June) so they all could come over and attend in between the treatments.

Then Covid hit here around Mid-March ,and with that the hopes of seeing them for the wedding.

Around April, after another routine check, the doctors did yet another biopsy and discovered that the tumor spread to his liver, and that apparently he has another simultaneous, non malignant cancer in his bladder, which is unrelated to melanoma.

Putting aside the fact the wedding planning was hard on us as it is due to the uncertainty brought by Covid,living with the fact my dad was going through immunology treatments which weren't really doing much and his deterioration felt like too much to handle.

Luckily, me and my SO managed to hold the wedding without too much trouble, with my dad and the rest of the family on conference call for the duration of the ceremony, which was quite bitter sweet for everyone involved.

I feel like this has already gotten quite rambly and long, but basically his Melanoma as of now has already spread past his initial tumor on his back, onto his lymph nodes, liver and now bones.

This past weekend I've received an update from his wife that he's had severe abdominal pains, and was rushed to the ER, his scans showed that his Liver is now twice its size, he's been on an induced coma since then to ease his suffering and perform any required tests to try and stabilize his condition.

Up until Covid hit, I've managed to draw inspiration from a lot of sources, here included, from people dealing with sick parents both close to them and overseas, but I feel that because of the pandemic the situation has just gotten much more difficult for me to handle mentally, mostly because I'm helpless and can't do anything.

I'm very lucky to have my SO and my close friends to be here for me and support me, but this situation feels so extreme because of the distance and the pandemic and I am honestly having a hard time to cope with all of it.

**TLDR;** My dad is battling stage 4 Melanoma that's spreading and is currently in an induced coma on the other side of the globe. I'm having a hard time to cope with not only the distance but also the feeling of helplessness due to the fact Covid has pretty much shut down any hopes of my flying there to be with my family and say goodbye.

I guess I'm just looking to vent, and hopefully maybe find some words of encouragement, words of wisdom or anything to help with coping as it just feels overwhelming.",2020-08-02 16:59:14

I hate that I’m having to post this but I’m hoping for some support. This is a bit of back story and the even that happened today. 

A very close family member of mine was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer-a Glioblastoma. It was promptly removed and chemo and radiation done. We have already passed the anticipated death day if we hadn’t done any treatment. 

This person is my angel. I love them so much. When I heard the news I was broken. I sobbed and raged for 24 hours. Couldn’t sleep... forgot to breathe even. 

Today I was at my beautiful mom’s house. She asked me for a favour and said she couldn’t do it herself. I agreed enthusiastically thinking it was help with her cat’s nail trim or something. She handed me a box.

Mom: “It’s heavy isn’t it?”
Me:”Uh yes it is.... what is it” 
*I see the label on the box just as she tells me* 
Mom: “It’s an urn... for (family member).

I immediately started crying. I opened the box and it was beautiful I guess. Purple petal like detailing with silver trim I guess that had like vine detailing engraved. She told me part of our family member will go in there and when my mom dies, she wants me to put her in there. I guess if I get cremated I’ll do the same. She said then we’d be together forever (cue more ugly sobs). 

I was surprised as she is taking it extremely hard and when my pet died she couldn’t even look at photos. But she was so brave and strong. It helped my beautiful mom so I don’t hold it against her, I am trying to be her rock during this time. But I needed to come here and vent. Fuck cancer. In less than a year, someone I love so much can be gone from me. Yes I’m thankful I have time to say goodbye but I’m still not dealing well with a traumatic death that happened to my best friend 3 years ago (or just starting to deal). I’m scared this is going to break me I guess...

My mom and dad do not know. I don't know if I should tell them or keep it from them.

We can have normal conversations much of the time but mainly at night when she's getting ready for bed and in the morning when she's getting up, she's full of despair.

She moans and sometime screams and buries her head in her hands, and just seems to give up. She says it not so much the pain but the extreme exhaustion. But she also switches from a normal voice to this despairing one at the drop of a hat. 

I live across country from her and am here for two weeks but my dad, who is 85, is her main caregiver. It's overwhelming for him, especially when she wails and also blames him  for everything.

Because of the coronavirus, at this moment, it appears I can't get anyone to come in to help care for her on a regular basis, nor can we find a place (assisted living) that will take her now because of Covid. 

Anyway, anyone else deal with this? It's so hard to be the strong emotional one day after day. I mean, if I were here full-time, I could do it. But my dad doesn't have the compassion, patience or just all-around presence to be a source of comfort to her when she most needs it.

That was her husband, my grandfather, whom I was also incredibly close with. He passed away from natural causes over 6 years ago. It feels like much less.

I’ve never lost someone to cancer before, except a family friend a few months ago. I can’t imagine a world without my grandmother. I feel like in my head, I’m thinking very clearly, but my body just keeps crying in bed. I don’t know what to do.
All I can really take to heart right now is everything she’s telling me, that it’s okay and she’s at peace.

I’m not sure how to mourn, either. It feels like I’m mourning now, but I haven’t lost her. She might be here as late as Halloween. I can’t possibly know what it’s going to be like when I’m no longer able to call and text her whenever either of us wants to.",2020-05-28 06:17:40
570,About telling my friends of my mom's situation,6,gpf2lr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/gpf2lr/about_telling_my_friends_of_my_moms_situation/,9,1590305470.0,"So... my and my little sister were told today by my mom (who has been battleing since 2017) that the illness has not been reduced enough. The doctor said it's gonna be useless to continue treatment by this point, so it's only matter of time that she will pass away. It hurts a lot. We don't know if it's gonna be months, a year or more. But we know that it is inevitable.

My question is: How do I tell my friends and loved ones about this?? I feel I should, but I don't know how. And with qurantine still going on in my country for a long time I think I'll only be only to tell them by videocall, but I don't know if it's gonna be the best, cause they can't contain me and it's gonna be awkward to start to cry in front of them alone in my room while they stare in the camera. But I think it well help me a lot if they know.
So, what should I do? I know you don't have much context and each situation is different, but leaving tips or your own experiences with it will  help

My mom got diagnosed 3 years ago with breast cancer and after her round of chemo the cancer metastasized to her back and is now in her bones. It’s been awful and so difficult. She just seems to be on a mission to take us down with her? She constantly makes us feel shitty and belittle us because she feels crappy, she loses her temper and used her sickness to make herself the victim..and the worst part is she uses her dying to manipulate us and make us feel awful. “Oh don’t worry I know you’ll have peace when I die soon” I suffer from depression, I almost failed out of Engg school because i was in such a deep hole.
It sucks because it’s this constant battle of “fuck that I don’t deserve that” and “fuck, I know she’s sick and gotta be patient” but..am I crazy to think she can’t just use her sickness to manipulate me emotionally? As far as I know, I don’t think she actually feels like she’s going to die soon. She’s always planning and doing things about the future..so I don’t know. I hate this battle in my head. She has always had a way to totally just emotionally unbalance me. I love my mom
And she’s amazing, but fuck this sickness and just fuck this shit. 
I am thankful because I have worked sooo incredibly hard and I don’t feel in this massive hole anymore. It’s still incredibly incredibly hard, just never know what mom I’m going to get. And she doesn’t see it she doesnt get it, and she won’t get any help. In her eyes, she can’t talk, she can’t do anything because she’s so awful..again just the victim. 

Sigh I’m just sick and tired of the emotional manipulation. I’ve tried talking to her about it but obviously hasn’t gone well. Mom is incredibly stubborn even before this happened so, I don’t know. 

My aunts husband died from cancer a few years ago and I talk to her and my cousin a lot. They just say it’s the sickness and it’s what happens. I just seriously hate that they can hide behind this sickness and do whatever. I feel emotionally abused :( and I feel so bad for my dad..he’s stuck between us you know? This all is just fucking Shittty.

My grandmother was 16 when she had my mom and she was 18 when she had me my brother 2 years later so my grandparents are really actually young enough to have been our parents any way. So it's always just been the 4-5 of us. My grandfather is the only one who I connected with as we are very much alike i.e we both have bad anger issues plus bipolar among a number of other things. My grandfather went to dr 2 weeks ago to have blood drained from bladder they found 3 tumors while he was there they removed them did biopsy we just found out it's his cancer back. He was told in 2012 he was in 4 stage bladder cancer. He did chem/rad and after few years was in full remission. He's been getting worse. He's so tired he's never hungry when he eats it's only sweets to be honest he smokes cannabis to combat cancer symptoms but now when he does he pass out/falls asleep and he starts convulsing/shaking i haven't seen this happen in person as I'm trying to stay away so i don't get him sick this is what my grandmother has relayed to me he said he won't do chem/rad again nor will he have to use a pee bag(sorry I don't know Technical name) he is overweight and has copd I'm not sure if he can even have surgery but im just wondering can I give him my bladder I will use bag I don't care I just can't be here without my grandfather i literally have 0 friends except my 2 kitties my grandpa is my best friend I need him to be here to see me get my life together it is not possible then what can I do to help him also what could be causing the seizure like behavior that's happening what do I need to know to expect in these coming days any advice would be greatly appreciated I've tried researching what I could but my mind is so foggy it's hard to think tI want to thank anyone in advance who takes time to read this and for any helpful comments I may get.

I remember the day she told me the cancer progressed to stage III. After double nephrostomy surgery, she looked up at me from her hospital bed with determination and said, ""I will fight with everything I've got."" That was about a year ago. Now the cancer is stage IVb and is widespread in her abdomen.

She gave it all of her will, and dutifully took life extending treatments, remaining positive but wearing down a little more each time. She stopped being able to join us for holidays and birthdays. Then she stopped being able to sit up for long periods. Now she's all but stopped eating and hardly has the energy to talk. My family is trying to push food on her whenever they can, but I don't think they understand that she probably can't digest food the same way anymore.

She is slowly wasting away. As thin as any living human ever was. I don't think she has very long left. I'm trying to spend time with her when she can tolerate company and help to care for and pamper her just a little.

I keep getting the urge to call her in panic. I know that won't help her for me to panic. So I only call every few days and just swallow the existential dread in between. I try not to think about how her very cells are damaged and diseased beyond repair. 

 I'm not the only one panicking- my grandmother, dad, and sister are all freaking out in their own individual ways. My dad dug up the entire landscaping and sprinkler system on his property by hand.

For 2 of those years he was going weekly to a doctor because of a toenail fungus. My dad went each week and they just told him it was nothing and to come back next week. They checked several times for cancer on the toe and then one day after two years it finally popped up as stage 3 melanoma. Went on immunotherapy for about a year to find out it did nothing to stop the spread of the cancer and has passed into the blood and his liver. I am an only child to my dad and mom. I am a 22 year old guy still in college and never had a major relationship. My one regret is that I want to give my dad grand kids before he passes but I am not ready yet. This may be his last Christmas and I am hating myself for not finishing college on time and not being able to have him there for my wedding and children whenever they may come.

It has spread now in his cerebrospinal fluid. He cannot feel his chin anymore. He started his first chemo last week. 

I went to see him this week-end and I talked this morning to one of his doctors. I could not ask her about my dad’s prognosis as he was with me but she made it clear that it will be a long fight and that he will be almost non stop at the hospital before/during/after his remaining chemos. She said also that they will reevaluate his treatment when the chemos were over and for now, they couldn’t predict what are the next steps. 

 It was so hard to see him that vulnerable. My dad rarely shows his emotions but now, he is an open book. 
I tried not to cry in front of him but since I left the hospital, I cannot stop. I live abroad and it is so hard to be that far and to feel that helpless. How do you cope with that ? Any advice ?",2019-12-10 06:52:38
602,Cancer is taking my Dad from me..,5,e37oer,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/e37oer/cancer_is_taking_my_dad_from_me/,18,1575020304.0,"It's been almost a year since my Dad was diagnosed with Stage 4 Colon Cancer that metastasized to his Liver, and it's been a tough year for him mentally and physically. 

It all started when my Dad and stepmom noticed a 'knot' underneath his right rib. Went to his GP and she sent him to a Gastrointestinal Specialist to check him out. The first visit they just did xrays and was told that he had tumors covering his left and right lobes on his liver. This man, who was just the nurse because the actual Dr wasn't there, basically told us that it was useless, that nothing would help him. Worst News Ever..😟
We then made an appointment with his now Oncologist, who is amazing by the way, and he said he wouldn't be able to tell us anything without a colonoscopy and a liver biopsy done. The colonoscopy showed a 6cm 'mass', Cancer, 3cm inside his rectum and the liver biopsy did indeed show Cancer. Dads Oncologist told him this news and it broke my heart because my Dad doesn't deserve this horrible disease. The Oncologist, Dr Boniol, told us that without any chemo treatment, he had maybe 3 months to live. This wasn't an option for me. Chemo and Radiation it is. Even Worse News..😥
Dad had an appointment the same day as the colonoscopy to get his Port Placement done. While he was in surgery for that, I walked to the Cancer Center, which is in the same hospital area, and made his appointment for his first round of Chemo. While making the appointment at the Cancer Center I was told insurance hasn't approved treatment yet, so the nurse called Boniol. This great Dr told the nurse to go ahead and schedule the appointment, without insurance approval, because he knows without it my Dad won't make it. Best Dr Ever..💙💚
Chemo first: 12 rounds of FOLFOX and 10 rounds of Avastin is the Chemo he will have. Besides the neuropathy and occasional nausea he was doing great, until his 9th FOLFOX/7th Avastin. He wasn't feeling good and was having trouble swallowing. Dad was taken to the ER because we was scared of something going wrong, boy were we right! His blood sugar was 867 when he was admitted into the hospital and extremely close to, well nothing good. Boniol said the Avastin can sometimes bring out diabetes in someone that already has a mild case of it, we had no idea. Dad was very lucky to be alive on this day. So he now has Colon/Liver Cancer and Diabetes. WTF!!😤
Fast forward to Dad finishing the FOLFOX/Avastin Chemo treatments. He gets his first scan done after Chemo and they show that the Chemo has indeed worked on the Colon Cancer. 👍
Up next will be Sirtex Radiation Beads to treat his Liver Cancer. This will only be 2 rounds of this treatment, one round for each lobe. The Sirtex Beads will be injected directly into his liver, instead of throughout his whole body, and they will then stick to the Cancer and fight it. The 1st treatment went real good for Dad. I mean, he was really low on energy for about a week after but he evened out around the 2nd week. The 2nd treatment hit him worse. His energy level is crazy low and we, my stepmom and I, have noticed that he has started being not as positive at the outcome after all his treatments. He's Scared Now..😰
Almost 2 weeks after his 2nd Radiation treatment, he was having bowel issues, memory loss, trouble swallowing food and he's lost tons of muscle in his body. My stepmom and I took him to the ER and the CT Scan showed 2 spots on his brain and that means, within the past week or so, Dad had a Stroke. He has no idea when he had the Stroke, so we're thinking it happened in his sleep. Which scares all of us because that means he's lucky he even woke up from it.. What's Next..😩
Since the Stroke happened Dad has been an emotional wreck. When anyone tells him that they love him, he gets tears in his eyes. He's scared to death of what's happening to him, I can see it in his eyes. My stepmom and I have been to each and every Dr appointment since this started and we are constantly telling him that it's okay to be scared, because it's the unknown. He has no idea what all this will end up becoming and it scares the shit out of him. 🤯
All the family has repeatedly told him that we are all here for him, for no matter what he needs/wants and not to be scared to talk to any of us, to which he usually replies that he doesn't wanna be a bother to anyone. We have all been trying to assure him that he is no bother at all and that we will all be there for him, even if he doesn't want us to help.😌
Dad told me today that he's glad that I, his only daughter, has been there to help him and my stepmom from the beginning. Said he doesn't want to think of where he'd be if I wasn't there to help them both throughout all of this disease. I told him that he took care of me growing up and that it was my turn to help take care of him.😥
Even after me reassuring him again that he is no bother at all to me if he needs anything from me. This is my Dad and he has been a great Dad. If there is anything I can do to make him forget for a moment about his situation, I will. If there is anything I can do to make sure he knows that I'm not going anywhere, I will. This man is my rock and I will be forever grateful that he was chosen to be my Dad. I will love him forever and will make sure he knows how much I love him forever!💗
Thanks to anyone to reads my families Cancer story and if anyone has any advice on what I can do to help my Dad, please let me know. I appreciate any help to help my Dad.

She started chemo and has already lost her hair. She can no longer work which is killing her spirits because she is a workaholic (worked 3 jobs almost 80 hours a week). I know she feels like she’s losing her life and she is in a lot of physical pain as well but she is making it difficult to live with her. I didn’t move out after college so I could pay off my loans I worked 2 jobs for about a year. I didn’t have much of a social life during that time until recently I took up a job that pays a lot more and now I only work my second job once a week. I had a good work/life balance until my mom got worse and I felt trapped and like I had to be there for her every day she was in the hospital. I even cleaned the house and prepared a bedroom for her downstairs just Incase the day comes she can’t make it up the stairs anymore. Well she came home and yelled at me for changing everything (only 2 rooms we almost never use were affected. It’s just us 2 in a 6 bedroom home) I feel like nothing I do is appreciated. Up until about October 2019 my mom always cooked for me and once she became too weak I taught myself how to cook and I actually enjoy it but anyway she yelled at me bc I didn’t cook the rice I was planning to eat the way she wanted me to. She didn’t want to eat the rice because she already had food someone brought her but still wanted to criticize my cooking method. It tasted fine btw. I just feel exhausted and I am back to crying everyday on my way home from work bc living with her is so stressful. Any advice is welcome.,2019-11-29 00:23:08

My Dad has recently been treated for advanced prostate cancer. The chemo was successful in clearing the metastasized bits and hormone therapy is suppressing the original tumour. He has check ups every three months to monitor the situation. 

As part of the most recent check up (which gave us the great news about the successful chemo), he was given a colonoscopy as a routine test, but the results hadn't come back in time for the appointment so we've been waiting for them for a week or so. The doctors weren't expecting any bad news and so my parents went on a short holiday to celebrate him getting through the last year. 

They come back in the early hours on Sunday. Today (Friday) I got a call from the colo-rectal department  people at the hospital and I have to pass on to my dad that they want to run more tests. Obviously this is essential information that he needs to know, but morally I'm conflicted. He is happy and enjoying his holiday. All the weight is off his shoulders. Telling him now would make the last day of his trip incredibly stressful. 

Is it okay to wait for him to get back to give him this news? If things are bad, and I am terrified that they are because if everything was fine they wouldn't want more tests, then he might be in for another year of difficulty and pain and sickness. Having the memory of this blissful holiday might make it easier to endure what's coming. But keeping it from him, even for such a short time, feels wrong too. It's his medical condition and his body and he should know.

I know it's her choice. I know I'm selfish. But she's my mother. She's the most important person in my life. I can't live without her. I don't want to. It kills me to see her in pain, but to not see her at all? I can't do that. We need her. We need her strong and healthy. What if they helped her and she's fine afterwards? Why can't that be the situation? 

They said the same abour her coming to intensive care, but she's in pain either way. That's not okay. 

Last week they send us away saying that they can't help her and now we're back. I don't know. I can't talk to ger without her getting upsad at me for being upset. I can't talk to my brother's or father without them yelling at me for being upset, or because I don't ""care for her correctly"". When people come to visit her (like.her friends) they yell at me. For example she asked me to hand her her favourite parfum, because she missed the smell. I handed her parfum and everyone ganged up on me and called me all the names you can immagine. They than kicked me out of the hospital room till they were done visiting her. 
My mother talked with a nutritionist and I told the nutritionist that many people got in her head with things that she shouldn't eat (anything with sugar, bread, certain fruits and vegetables, any milk products) and that they made her drink and eat the weirdest things. Most of the time she'd starve herself, because they got so in her head about her being responsible for the groth or the cancer and she got scared. The nutritionist proved all of them wrong and told me to make sure that she eats well and showed me what she should eat. I left for work and when I came back I noticed that she didn't want to eat again and that many ""friends"" were visiting her. After I got her something to eat, everyone started to yell at me for following the instructions if the nutritionist (who apparently according to them new nothing). 

My family tells me to keep going to school (fultime), internship and work, but when I leave the house I'm made to feel like the worst human to ever exist. When I stay at home it's also a problem. How dare I use my mother's illness as an excuse to slack of? 
When I go to school, me missing classes is also an issue and every time I prepare for my exam week, something happens and I stay with my mother, because I care about her more than a dumb test. I also just had surgery and that made it impossible for me to leave my house and made it harder for me to help her. This didn't really help the situation at all. I failed this year, obviously, and I'm now officially a waste of space. Seeing as I didn't pass my 3th year of college I'm now seen as the maid of the family. 
But I swear that I tried. I used to wake up, go to my mother's hospitsl appointments, rush to work, work till midnight, and use the evening to work on school only sleeping about 2 hours before doing the same thing over the next day. When I didn't have school or appointments I'd try to catch up on sleep and I'd be woken up by people yelling at me for being useless. 
 I had to make a choice, because everything that I did wasn't done well. I'd give up everything for my mother. If I could take her place I wouldn't even think twice about it. 

I'm just scared and sad and tired and exhausted and over it all.",2019-06-26 21:31:57

Watching my dad lay in a bed and slowly die for the last 6 months is the worst way a person can go out. I have always believed in natural treatments and prevention and have always disagreed with western medicine and their practices. It looks like my dad is literally in hell and I just don’t know how long a human should do this. It seems like cruel and unusual punishment to me. They’re saying even if everything goes 100% perfect and he does get better, recovery could be 2 years only to provide him another 3 years tops. Plus some of the issues he is dealing with could be permanent so he is just trading in one sickness for another. Is this worth it!?! Maybe something is wrong with my brain and my perspective, but imagining him going through this for the next few years just does not click in my head. 

Maybe this is the way I was raised or my family dynamic, I don’t know. I just want to be clear headed and a good person, but my family has never been close. My dad has been single and living alone for a very long time so all he has is the damaged relationships with my brothers and myself. All three of us are there as often as possible and I quit my job to be his full time caregiver... but I can’t do this job for YEARS. This is AWFUL!!!!! Every day is awful and of course even more awful for my poor father. Does the fact that I’m not willing to sacrifice years of my life make me a bad person?

She was in remission and it was sudden- we didn’t get a chance for the big dramatic movie scene of a candlelight vigil by her bed while we say our tearful goodbyes. Her 10 year old daughter found her on the floor before she left for school in the morning. 

My mom was one of her main caregivers since the diagnosis. My sister and her husband had been basically separated for 3 years due to his infidelity (what a gem, right?), he hadn’t been living at their house and they were two months until the divorce was finalized. My mother is a nurse and had been preparing for this to happen. My father on the other hand was in deep denial that this would ever happen and never wanted to make plans. For him, he not only lost a daughter, but also his best friend. He couldn’t even look at pictures or talk about it for the first few days until the wake. He is back at work which has helped. 

As we look toward the next few months to years, to the rest of our lives- my brother and I are trying to find the best way to support our parents (while still coping with our own grief). I went on binge cleaning mode at their house for the first three weeks but I am now returning to work (this all happened while on maternity leave- writing at obit at 1am while nursing a 2 month old is not amazing).

617,My mom’s experience with cannabis oil,6,bii12m,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/bii12m/my_moms_experience_with_cannabis_oil/,3,1556526152.0,"My mom had/has advanced small cell lung cancer. There was a 7.7cm mass in one lung, spots on her other lung, cancer wrapped around her esophagus, spots around her liver and more spots in her lower back. She was given 6-12 months without treatment and 12-18 with when she was officially diagnosed in June/July of last year. 

She went through 11 rounds of radiation and 6 rounds of chemo and went for a follow up PET scan a couple weeks ago. When she went in for the results, her oncologist was thrilled. She said every area of cancer is gone except the larger tumor that has now shrunk to 1.4cm and is no longer active. She used words like “miraculous” and said this is “massive.” She also wanted to know what my mom has been doing outside of the prescribed treatment which leads me to my reason for posting. 

My mom has always been a smoker, both of weed and cigarettes but she quit the cigarettes once this all started. When she was diagnosed, she dove into CBD and THC research and started using Rick Simpson oil. She also cut down her sugar intake and tried to keep her body alkaline. She began making her own RSO and occasionally would vape it but mainly was putting into pill capsules and taking it that way. 

While there is no definitive proof it was the oil, her oncologist said while she can’t endorse it, she wanted to know all the how/what/when of the oil and told my mom to keep it up. 

Her cancer has a very high return rate and I know this period of clarity isn’t unheard of so while I’m absolutely celebrating this victory, I know the future is still very unclear. It’s just that the way her oncologist spoke was very telling to us-instead of her usual calm and careful choosing of words, she was excited and curious for more information. 

We both have a strong faith and she’s had a huge group of people praying for her so she credits this entirely to God and the wonderful, healing plant He put on the earth! 

I hope this isn’t upsetting to anyone, I purely mean it is information and a testament to my mom’s experience with the oil. I hope it can maybe help someone else!",2019-04-29 08:22:32

619,My mom has been fighting advanced colon cancer for two years but this is the beginning of the end,5,bgq8ht,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/bgq8ht/my_mom_has_been_fighting_advanced_colon_cancer/,12,1556108324.0,"So two years ago my mom went to the ER because she wasn’t feeling well. She hadn’t been feeling 100% for a while and one night she was shivering so hard and even with the fireplace going and a million blankets on her she still felt freezing. They found some spots in her liver and eventually determined it was colon cancer that had spread to her liver. Her liver was covered in spots and she had tumors on her colon, mainly one big one.


She began very aggressive treatment but even from the beginning we knew it was very unlikely she would be cure and the main goal of treatment was to give her more good time. This time last year she found a spot on her lung but she opted to not have it biopsied or taken out. What would be the point if she already has cancer? She did chemo treatment on and off and tried some experimental radiation therapy too where they injected little radioactive pellets (I think?) right into her liver. But since the beginning of this year she lost her insurance and isn’t eligible for social security benefits so money has been really tight. She’s just been taking a radiation therapy in pill form. 


Now, last week, she fell outside the chiropractors office. She’d been having pain in her groin and down her leg for a couple months. She figured it was just a muscle thing because she’d been pretty low energy and was just laying in her recliner all day. But after the fall she went to the ER and they found a fracture in her femur. She went into surgery the next day to put a pin in her femur to help strengthen the bone and they found a tumor, likely the cause of the fracture. 


My mom has lived two years with this disease and she has remained so strong. We’ve gone on many trips together and she finally fulfilled her dream of buying a motor home. I helped her drive it cross country back home. She’s so strong and amazing and I can’t believe this is happening. Her goal from the very beginning was to live long enough to see my youngest sibling graduate high school to make sure they’d really be okay. They graduate next month so she’s made it to her goal from the very beginning. With the developments of her cancer she’s not going to do anymore extensive chemo or treatment. I’m not even sure if she’ll still take the pill she’s been taking. She had a blood clot in her leg last year and the doctor gave her the best blood thinner but she doesn’t take it anymore because she has to inject herself every day. I really can’t blame her at all. I get it, she’s tired. I can’t even imagine what chemo feels like but I can see that it really beats her down. I even told her from the beginning that if she didn’t want to do treatment I would understand but she basically said “hell yeah I’m doing treatment! I got shit to do!” 


All her life my mom has served others. She took in kids off the street to help them live better lives. She helped people at church. When I was really young she would take one of our neighbors to her chemo treatments every week and help keep her company. I really can’t remember her taking baths or going to the spa or doing anything for herself but I remember going with her to volunteering events and working at the soup kitchen for the homeless. I’ve been so depressed and I just feel like this is really truly the beginning of the end. It’s not a good outlook once it spreads to the bone and especially if she isn’t doing treatment anymore, I know she’ll be gone very soon. I cried today with my boyfriend then I was okay getting ready for work but once I was alone in my car I started crying again. I went into work and I couldn’t stop crying so my boss pulled me aside and told me I could take the night off and told me to call her if I need more time. I don’t even know why I’m writing this. I just feel so wrecked. I have a really bad headache from crying so hard all day but I hate living my life knowing my mom is dying. She lives 1000 miles away and it’s hard to take time off work because money and also I feel bad. I don’t even know why I feel bad but I do. I work a job that you can’t really pick up the work tomorrow so if I’m gone then everyone is left short staffed. My managers seem to be very kind and understanding about the situation but I also worry about losing my job for taking time off which is silly because it’s not even a big career or anything, it’s just a in a meantime type job. 


I just really feel like my life is crashing. I love my mom, she’s my best friend. Sometimes I don’t call her because I want to forget what’s going on but then I feel bad because I don’t call. I feel like I need to be there for my siblings and check in with them but I always just feel like I’m barely struggling to hold myself down, how can I try to support someone else? This post is a mess but I just need to get it all out.",2019-04-24 12:18:44

To start, I’m only 18, so the thought of my mom dying has never really crossed my mind for the near future. I don’t really know how to handle the death of a family member because I have no experience in it at all. Anyways.

Three years ago she was diagnosed with  stage 2 colorectal cancer. While it’s not deadly, I still had to cope with 10 weeks of watching my mother, who inspires me so much, having to go through the most horrifying experiences. The hardest part was that I was 15 and in a brand new school (start of high school). 

Last year, they noticed something on one of her CT scans and thought that it might be cancer, only a different kind. They operated on her leg and removed a lymph node because they thought she had lymphoma. Luckily this time it was fully encapsulated and didn’t spread to anywhere else, but we kept an eye out.

On Monday, three years after she finished treatments, she had another CT scan and colonoscopy appointment, as they constantly check to make sure that the cancer hasn’t come back. I was supposed to get the results today (Friday). They were inconclusive. Everything was pretty much fine for the last three years, but even when it wasn’t at least we had an answer. Inconclusive. I’m in college now and it’s 8x more stressful than high school ever was. All I can think about now is the inconclusive results that could turn out to mean another round of chemo and radiation. 

While she hasn’t been diagnosed again yet, I’m still hoping that there’s somebody here that I can at least talk to and vent to. Hopefully all is well, it would take a load off my mind. If anybody has any suggestions with coping mechanisms, especially ones that work with younger people, I’m honestly open to just about anything at this point. Thanks times a million everyone.

629,Mom about to start chemo,6,8p44ad,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/8p44ad/mom_about_to_start_chemo/,3,1528345971.0,"I don’t know where else to write this, I just have a lot to get off my chest and this seems to be a good place. I’m just filled with a lot of conflicting emotions right now and don’t know how to feel.

My mom was diagnosed about 2 years ago. Went into the ER for super high blood pressure and we found out she had breast cancer. One of the most frustrating parts of it was that she knew she had a lump, she had felt it, but had kept it to herself not to inconvenience and worry the family for almost a full year prior. Long story short, after tests we got the full diagnosis: stage 4 breast cancer, metastasized, spread to the bones and the lungs.

The first doctor gave her a 2 year prognosis with treatment, including chemo and removal of breast. We looked for a second opinion and took her to City of Hope (a treatment center in Southern California). Everything seemed to be much better. The diagnosis didn’t change but they put her on hormonal treatment and gave her a shot for her bones. It really did seem to be working well, the liquid in her lungs stopped accumulating, she was responding well to it all. They said that with treatment she was looking at 10 years (mom is in her 60s).

Then the insurance started to screw us over. We’re low income, and being diagnosed with cancer meant she was disabled so she was getting basic health insurance coverage. Don’t ask me to explain whether she had Medical or Medicare or what have you because at the end of all of this I still don’t know and was left even more confused than when we began. 

We had to join a network and I spent a long time on the phone taking time off work to make sure we had the right coverage that would allow her to continue her treatment at City of Hope. The network we ended up with, the representative assured me that CoH was covered under their plan. A month down the line I get a message from CoH saying that they couldn’t treat my mom because the insurance was refusing to cover her. 

It took me literally several weeks, if not months, spent in the phone with who knows how many reps, to try and get a solid answer. I had to ultimately file a complaint and get the state ombudsman’s office involved. With a person from the ombudsman’s office on the other line they had to basically admit that the first rep that had told me CoH was covered had lied to me. Their way out of it was that technically he hadn’t lied, because if my mom’s treatment had to absolutely continue at CoH and couldn’t be done anywhere else then the insurance would cover for it. 

Throughout that two month period of no insurance we had to pay for her shot for her bones out of pocket which would’ve amounted to several thousands of dollars. My mom absolutely refused to have that no matter what. Thankfully and maybe because I had gotten the state involved, we were able to get a really good doctor locally to continue her treatment and it seemed to be going well (or as well as it could go) again. She was even able to travel.

Well, some months ago she went in for a dental appointment and the dentist completely botched the procedure, causing a lot of damage to her jawbone. Nothing unfixable, except it meant she couldn’t take her shot, so she was in a lot of pain for months on end. Then just a month or so ago, as she was finally getting better to start having her shots again, there were complications with the insurance yet again. I’m in Canada right now, on the east coast, so my sister has had to deal with a lot of this. She had a doctor’s appointment with a new doctor and it seems to be pretty bad. They are recommending chemo right away. I had to find out through the phone, with my dad telling me, his voice almost breaking. On top of it all I’m also worried about him because of his high blood pressure and heart problems. 

Well, I’m sitting here, in Montreal, miles away, not knowing what to do. I can’t call my mom or my sister. I can’t bring myself to talk to them. My sister is a ball of anxiety and stress as is, and my mom acts like nothing’s wrong. I do know she doesn’t care about herself one bit and has seen this as an odd wish fulfillment (my mom is an odd woman, her entire life, since I can remember, she’s talked about not wanting to live past 70, describing that as her greatest fear).  

I don’t know, I’m just rambling at this point. Like I said, I just needed to write this out somewhere. Thanks for reading.",2018-06-07 04:32:51

633,Struggling with letting my boyfriend in more about my moms terminal cancer,4,jeyzm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/jeyzm7/struggling_with_letting_my_boyfriend_in_more/,4,1603257847.0,"I am struggling with how to let my (23f) boyfriend (25m) in more regarding my moms (57f) terminal illness. I am sorry if this is long, but i feel like I have so much I need to air out and I don’t know where to turn.

 A little under a year ago my mom was diagnosed with late stage breast cancer. My mom has had cancer twice before in the past decade, but had 4 good and healthy years before this terminal diagnosis. 

Up until early September, my mom had very few symptoms. She maintained a rich social life, walked the dog every day and was mostly feeling herself. It was easy for me to remain positive when my mom was seemingly doing great. But in the last few months her condition has worsened. In the past few weeks especially, she has had severe pain, major loss in appetite and has been basically bedridden. We are awaiting further diagnostics and answers but this a very bad sign that the end may be closer than we anticipated. Her visible symptoms make the nature of her life ending feel way more real which is forcing me to come to terms with things in a bigger way. 

I think I have somewhat accepted the nature of the situation, and I remain somewhat positive. I am super grateful for the 23 years I have had with her, I feel like we had a bond that many people can’t cultivate in a lifetime. My mom has the best attitude. She lives in the moment, she has an unmatched love for life and appreciation for the little things. It’s tough to see this side of her fading away in recent weeks. She’s my biggest fan, and I admire her so much. She and I are best friends. My mom and I have discussed that when she passes we truly will not have anything left unsaid because we understand each other and are bonded on such a deep level.  But that still doesn’t make what’s happening any less sad, and I still am experiencing anticipatory grief, helplessness, anxiety and uncertainty. 

For more context on my relationship- my boyfriend and I have been officially dating for 4 months but have a closeness that makes it feel like I’ve known him for a lifetime. We are more in love with each other than either of us has ever been with previous partners. We have spent lots of time with each others friends and families, we talk about everything, and have so much fun in each other’s company. He makes me feel so loved, we are so comfortable with each other, and I have so much faith in who he is as a person. I trust him immensely. He is genuine, easy to communicate with, humble and emotionally mature. But this doesn’t change the fact that the relationship is relativity new, even though I truly believe that he is going to be in my life for a long long time. 

My boyfriend is well aware of the situation with my mom. I have explained things in an in-depth way initially, and expressed some of my grievances along the way. But recently as my moms condition has worsened I’ve noticed I’ve pushed some of the emotions to the side and tried to throw myself into my social life, my job and my classes. The positivity of falling in love has made it somewhat easy to do so. But this past weekend while with my boyfriend something triggered feelings about my mom in the most unexpected way. I am usually very together with my emotions so it was tough to accept how out of control I felt. I cried in his arms on and off for a few hours while barely being able to say more than a few sentences. I usually do not feel comfortable enough to allow myself to do that with anyone but he gave me a very safe space to feel things out. I still went right to explaining away my emotions, things like “I am sorry I don’t know why I’m like this.” Or things like, “I think there is so much certainty and that’s scary”. But really didn’t give him much to go off of. I never really fully recovered for the rest of that day. He was immensely supportive. He asked a few questions, comforted me, listened to what I needed, and expressed empathy in such a huge way to the point that he was pretty much tearing up. He held me, gently asked if I wanted to go for a walk or go for ice cream, and showed me some of his favourite songs he listens to when he is sad. When we parted ways the next day I held him close and told him how much I appreciated him, and how I want to talk to him but sometimes it’s hard. 

He has told me many times if I need someone to talk to that he will be there. I can tell that he wants me to let him in more, and keep him updated on things too. I really want to be able to get into depth with all of the little things I am feeling about this and open up about the messy, intricate details about what my family is going through. But it’s tough because I feel like that’s a huge burden to put on someone. I don’t want him to feel badly because he doesn’t know the right thing to say. I also have my own baggage that if I let all of this messy stuff out too heavily that it can take away from all of the positive, fun and funny things I like about my personality and make me into someone who is “too much”. I know this is all in my head but it’s scary.  I don’t know if it’s inappropriate for me to put all of that on him, or if this is better suited for a psychologist. I feel like I really need someone to talk to who isn’t one of my immediate family members. Being completely vulnerable isn’t easy. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to or when to approach this with him or handle what I’m going through?

In particular his type seems to be metastatic disease (or multiple myeloma? \[not entirely sure, since my brain 100%  legitimately shut down after getting slapped with the word ""cancer""\]). We don't know how far it's spread or anything, since we were only talking to a chiropractor that has access to my dad's MRI scans (and the scans were strictly only focused on his spine, nothing else).

I'm just wondering if anyone else on here has experience with this type of cancer; so I can figure out what to expect survival wise. I'd especially like to at least get a semi-realistic guess on his chances of surviving this thing. It feels like the chiropractor friend who gave us this heads up may be blowing smoke up our asses a little bit to make us feel better; and I feel like the doctors are going to give us the dark, ""you're going to die from this 100% guaranteed"" version.

Does anyone have any experience (via a loved one and/or yourself), so I can try to manage my expectations a little bit?",2020-10-20 05:15:34

I know that it’s a tiring thing to be on this rollercoaster!

I know that I don’t want things to end but that is not entirely in my control

I believe in plants 

I believe in not prolonging suffering

I believe in listening to our bodies, including my moms

I believe in doing out of love, not fear

He's been experiencing issues with his breathing/lungs for almost a year now. He's been in and out of the ER and because he was negative for covid-19 each time, I really feel he was looked at as a drug seeker and wasn't given the full workup.

Regardless, he has a fracture in his spine and spots on his liver, pancreas and kidney that they are determining today (results in Friday) if they are malignant or not. Friday the has an MRI scan on his brain to check for lesions. At this point, we don't have a stage/grade or idea of treatment. He's been put on morphine and has been stomach sick since. 

I'm at a loss, this came as a crushing blow to my whole family and we are scrambling to do everything we can to fight for and support him.

My question to you, my new family, is how did you start? How did you become a cancer family? How did you support your loved one? What would you do differently?

Recap: my sister has been caring for my dad, he has cancer that spread from his lungs to his stomach and brain, stage 4. He had chemo and/or radiation (he always referred to both) and it didn’t seem to take. The pills prescribed were for comfort only. 

He ate at first, no much, and my sister would always try to give healthier foods, but it got to the point where she would give him anything he asked for, even if it was unhealthy because otherwise he just wouldn’t eat). Now, even when he’s like “man I could go for [this]” and she’ll say “ok let’s get it” hell backtrack and suddenly be like “no thank you” or “maybe tomorrow”. 

Last time I was there he at least ate a bit, and some stuff he enjoyed (like milkshakes) and regularly went to the bathroom. 

But this week (I just got back home yesterday) we’d be lucky if he drank a nutrition shake. No matter what she put in front of him - meals, candy, snacks, fruit - he wouldn’t touch. He very rarely uses the bathroom now. He has a urinal thing so he doesn’t have to get off the couch as much and possibly fall (he’d been falling, unless my sister helped him to the bathroom), and I happened to glance at it and his urine is so dark I didn’t even realize it was that at first. 

I asked him if he wanted to engage the Right To Try laws and try some experimental treatments: nope. He doesn’t want a nurse, or any sort of outside care especially a hospital, even if my sister and I would love to get an IV in him, he doesn’t want it and we’re trying to respect that. But he’s basically just letting himself die at this pint. 

I just flew home yesterday after staying there a week. My sister texted me today saying that he hasn’t eaten or drank anything yet, he’s less coherent and sleeping more, and he asked for me again (he asked for me before too, and even paid for my plane since I haven’t been able to get a job yet or have time for freelance work). She thinks he knows he’s going and wants me there. 

It’s a hassle to keep flying back and forth but I want to BE there for him in his last moments. I can’t imagine not. Unfortunately it puts stress on my mom and grandma who need help with house things, the dog, etc. 

Everything basically makes me feel guilty and I’m just breaking down at this point. I don’t know what to do.",2020-09-17 22:25:16

This will be the first time we've gotten an update on how effective the chemo has been, if it's caused her tumors to shrink. Honestly, I'm scared to death. I've mostly been feeling hopeful before today, but now I feel like I'm going to freak out until her appointment. My mom currently has Stage 4 appendix/renal cancer. I'm not sure exactly which type she has, but it's not hereditary, almost sounds like it was a random fluke where cells began splitting. I'm probably completely butchering the explanation I was told. 

A childhood friend's mom passed away recently from a fairly similar cancer, I believe she was also Stage 4. She struggled for years, had to have part of her colon removed, I honestly can't believe she lived for as long as she did. I'm terrified of the thought of that happening to my mom. The doctors are optimistic, saying that she could be having surgery, having a flush done, and be in recovery within a few months. 

My mom is such a huge part of my life, I don't know how I could live without her. I'm a single mom, my  daughters and I live with my parents.

It's been a very hard few months. Somedays are so bad that I just cry myself to sleep. This was not supposed to happen. My father died 5 years ago at the age of 45(due to cancer) and it was very difficult handling his death, resulting financial difficulties and the resulting distancing from my father's side of the family. These were the people who were a part of my life for the entire first 14 years and then poof. I'm the second youngest on my father's side and none of them could afford a phone call saying I'm sorry and I'll be there for you. It hurt very much. I had to console my brother(10 at that time) and it was harrowing to deal with. This happens just before my 10th grade exams. (Considered huge in India) While I did end up scoring well there were still judgements on how I should've scored higher and used my father's death as an excuse for scoring lower. 

While I haven't even given myself time to heal from that, this shows up. Since then it's only been me figuring out insurance, her medicines, doctor's visits, diagnostic tests. While she being a general physician herself helped, docs don't make good patients. 
My brother and grandmother(68) have been very supportive. We've had to move in with my grandmother and the joint family here.
Most days it's very hard to get by and have to deal with very little privacy/freedoms since we've moved into a hotspot are for COVID. So only hospital visits for chemo and doc consultations. I'm judged on how often I use my phone which is like my only link to the outside world and friends. 
I've lost a lot of important people in my life father, uncle(heart attack not cancer). I haven't yet mourned them properly and then this happens. Sometimes I lose faith in the world that it's putting me through all this. While I understand that my mom's health is the priority, I haven't had time to process this myself and it's been more than 2 months now. We've finished with 4 cycles of chemo each with a 15 day gap. 
There are some days where I just want to give up and leave this world altogether.

We found out on Easter of this year, and as hard as that was... it's not even comparable to now. Things have gotten so much worse. When he found out, he also had pneumonia and an abscess in his colon. They waited to start chemo until those were taken care of.

He finally started chemo in the beginning of July after the antibiotics and multiple scans. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd is when he went in and by the 7th he was in the hospital. My mom had to call the squad because he couldn't move, couldn't breathe, wasn't eating ect. He was in the hospital for 24 days! With pneumonia 10 times worse than before, ecoli in his bloodstream and the abscess had also grown in size.

He was not in good shape at all. So fast forward those 24 days after surgery (plurX tube), antibiotics, physical therapy, multiple scans ect. (July 31st) he got to come home! They tried putting him in a rehab facility because he couldn't couldnt walk. My mom didnt want that because a rehab facility near us had just had 11 people die from COVID. I drove over an hour to come help, because he is 2 person assist. I've been doing everything I can to help out. He has physical therapy, occupational therapy, a nurse who comes to take his vitals and drains the fluid from his lungs (plurX). 

I guess the point of this post is, I'm worried. His cancer doctor called and said that the chemo is basically what sent him to the hospital. She said that the chemo could kill him faster than the cancer. But without the chemo, he only has 3-6 months... Is there any way this could turn around? Hes doing much better mobility wise. He stood up by himself yesterday. But he also has his reeeeally bad days where he cant breathe, move or even eat.. hes cold all the time and he told me the other day that he could feel the cancer in his chest and it felt like he was drowning...

I hate seeing him like this because hes the type of person who is always up and doing something. As much as all of this makes me sad though, I've been trying to hold all the emotions in, and try to be as strong as I can for my mother, who I know is falling apart on the inside as well.

We first thought maybe she had Covid because of her elevated heart rate and shortness of breath but come to find out her brain cancer spread to her lungs and is crushing an artery and part of her trachea. I just lost my stepmom (mother’s wife) to ovarian cancer that metastasized to her brain in late April. I’ve barely had time to grieve that loss not only because I am a full time PreMed student and a full time restaurant manager but also because I never got to say goodbye because the hospice home didn’t allow visitors because of Covid. 

My mother is my last surviving patient, my dad died when I was 11 (motorcycle accident) then my stepmom and now my mom is becoming closer and closer to terminal. I’m struggling to have hope in the medicine and that it can help string the tumors. I’m trying to get myself to cope with the fact that they will only be able to slow the process. 

It’s hard to keep going when you’re only 20 and I feel like I still need my parents. Don’t get me wrong, I  completely independent from them. I moved out when I was 18 and have never asked for a penny since, but I still want them around. There are so many things I haven’t gotten to show them yet. 

I haven’t gotten to walk across the stage at graduation with my two bachelors degrees, I haven’t received my medical degree, I have had dreams of getting to get walked down the aisle and now I am afraid that I will have no parents to share those moments with.

On Friday her doctor informed her she is cancer free and done with chemo. Instead of being elated, I'm feeling extremely anxious because this means she will be living with me again.

Due to finances, I have been living with my mom for the past few years (the last two I have been attending grad school). I do love my mom but she is VERY needy. Depression, childhood trauma, and two failed marriages have really taken their toll. She sees me as her closest friend still while for years I have felt like the parent in the relationship.

When Covid hit our state, my mom moved in with her mother because I still had to work. It was a blessing as she is a retired nurse and the company was good for both of them. My grandmother is a natural caretaker and was on my mom about exercising, eating, taking meds, etc. Not only do I work full time, but I'm trying to finish my degree. Honestly, I don't know if either my mom or I would have survived lock-down together!

These few months have been the first time in ten years I have not lived with my mother, and it was so nice! We would usually still talk once a day, but I loved the freedom being by myself- no one to explain things to, not having to compromise activities because of someone else, just me and the animals. 

At her last doctor visit, not only was she declared cancer free but they said it was safe for her to return home. I don't know if I even felt a second of joy before the dread hit thinking of her coming home. I am terrified of returning to life with her here and feel like I am headed towards a wall at full speed and there is no steering wheel. I can't move out yet, can't ask her to stay where she is, and this journey hasn't seemed to alter her motivation to build a life for herself.

On top of that anxiety, I feel like a horrible person for not being more excited about her recovery. She beat pancreatic cancer! But I just keep thinking about if things go back to the why they were before she had cancer and it is almost suffocating.",2020-06-10 10:26:45

So they inserted a stent on her to keep the bile flowing. They did a CA19 test on her but it was within the normal range, they were unable to do a biopsy on her because inserting the stent was the bigger priority. We live in the Philippines so a bile duct biopsy is very difficult to get a sample of. The doctor ordered an MRI to be able to get a better imaging but nothing conclusive came out that would indicate cancer however, it's not to be ruled out. Because the scans were inconclusive and the CA19 test was normal, the doctors are debating whether it's inflammatory or cancer and gave us the option of anti TB medication for 2 months in the hopes that it's just a biliary TB. So we have 2 months gambling on anti TB meds, if it doesn't work then it's definitely cancer and this is a rare type of cancer that is Chemo-resistant and surgery doesn't do much better with the odds of survival.

I'm starting therapy soon, and I'll bring it up there, as well. Just some words to get off my shoulders today.

My mother (68) has metastatic breast cancer that has spread to her stomach, liver, and bones. For over two years, she has been kept progression-free and side-effect-free by some amazing at-home chemo pills.

Recently, her pills have failed, and the doctors have put her back on IV chemo at a hospital. She goes 3 times a month, and the oncology team's hope is to keep her progression-free for 6-9 months. After 5 treatments, her cancer markers are dropping, so preliminary results are good.

Emotionally, however, she has take a turn where does not want to be alive anymore and the \*key\* reason for this that she states all the time is that her hair has fallen out from chemo.

She'll say things like, ""I don't care about the stomach problems, all I can think about is how I don't have hair."" Or, ""I've lost my hair and I don't deserve to be alive anymore."" Or, ""I don't want to live if I have to wear a wig."" Or, ""Losing my hair means I'm a failure.""

For the past 2 years, she's been with a therapist who only works with cancer patients, so I'm sure they discuss it during her sessions.

I'm not looking to find a way to change her mind. I'm just dealing with the part where my mother has been given more time on Earth and she very clearly doesn't want to be here anymore and we don't have ""death with dignity"" procedures in our state and I feel like there's nothing we can do to help her enjoy the time she has left before the cancer really starts to kill her.",2020-05-27 02:49:44

My parents won't tell us what kind it is because they know we're a curious lot that'll look it up and freak ourselves out.

(Long rant-y post).",5,fub9zr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/fub9zr/mom_has_cancer_angry_frustrated_scared_long_ranty/,1,1585959490.0,"In early March, my mom went to the hospital because she had dangerously low potassium. She was in there for a couple weeks because complications and at one point they decided to do a colonoscopy. She got to come home, but last week they told her the results were that she had colon cancer. They said there was a large effected area, but that it don't think it's aggressive and believe they have a chance to remove it all with surgery. She's scheduled in for April 24th.  I'm hopeful that the surgery will remove it all and that she'll be cancer free afterwards, but I'm also nervous because the surgery is high risk for her due to her other health conditions. 

My relationship with my mother is... Complicated. She has always smoked a lot, and my paternal Nana's dying wish (like literally, she told me this the night before she died unexpectedly so it was a little eerie) was to help my mother realize that she needs to quit or otherwise it will kill her one day. I tried and tried... I would write whole multi-page essay type papers when I was 10 and slide them under her bedroom door at night, I would hide her smokes, I would spew facts about smoking and health out at random, I would tell her that I would use my allowance to buy her nicorette patches or gum or whatever. I would beg.... But she wouldn't listen. After years of trying, I'll admit I gave up. 

 When I was 12-15, she struggled with alcoholism and depression. This was a very difficult time for me as a tween/young teenage girl. I would come home and find her passed out on the floor (she was unemployed) and have to help her up the stairs to her room. I was always scared opening the house door after school, that she would fall down the stairs one day while and I'd find her dead. I always made sure I walked into the house before my little brother, just in case. When she was awake, she was a mean drunk and we'd fight often. She went to the hospital psych ward twice for a couple months. 

When I was 16, she started getting a little better. Things were pretty okay for a few years, but she never physically recovered from the damage she did to her body over those years (all she did was smoke and drink - many days she ate nothing), hence her underlying conditions that make the surgery such a risk. 

When I was 20ish, she left to live with my Nana (not the one who passed, this one was her mother) in another city. During this time, I hardly saw her. Maybe 3/4 times a year, on holidays. Shortly after, I found out my Nana had cancer. My mom stayed with her during her 5 year battle with cancer, until she passed away in 2017. 

I had my daughter August 2018. My mom (who had been living in the other city) moved back in with my dad, to be closer to her granddaughter. She absolutely loves her. She has been out babysitter the last year while I was working so they spend a lot of time together (to be clear, she is no longer struggling with alcoholism).


Anyway... I love my mom, but I don't feel sad for myself if she were to pass away from this. I'd move on. I am though angry she never listened to me as a child. Angry at myself that I couldn't stop her smoking. Angry that she won't treat this as a wake up call because she's so stubborn, she 100% thinks this is hereditary and has nothing to do with her lifestyle choices. Saddened that my daughter could grow up without her grandma. Saddened that my mother will miss out on seeing my daughter grow up. I always thought my mom would die young. She's 54. 

My husband asked me how I was taking the news. I didn't know what to say. The emotions I feel are so complex. I'm trying not to think too much about it until after the surgery. We'll see what happens. It's out of my control. I can only hope for the best at this point and hope that she'll learn from this. 

I also can't believe this is happening in the middle of a global pandemic.  Not that there's ever a good time for cancer, but... It's certainly a very bad time. I'm worried a little that cancer surgeries like my mom's (non-aggressive) will be postponed and that it could spread and get worse in that time. Or that she gets COVID-19 and that could be devestating too since she's high risk for that too.

He had to have his gallbladder out, he fell in the hospital and broke his femur and then when he recovered from that he fell at home and broke his arm.

No one prepared me. My mom is constantly watching him. She lives at the hospital. I flew in from out of state not realizing how he was. She left me with him to go take a shower while he slept. He woke up and was livid. He started to pull out his IV, electrodes, everything. I begged him not to do this and he called me a bunch of horrible names. I could see the fury in his eyes. He took off his dressing gown and tried to get out of the bed naked. I screamed for the nurses down the hallway, and they rushed in and started to try and calm him down. They upped his pain meds and he fell asleep. 

He talks to people that aren’t there. He calls me the name of his sister even though I’m his daughter. He’s so confused and out of it. He has no idea what’s going on. He makes me take off socks on his feet that are not there. It’s like he has dementia but he’s only 67

He gets agitated at least once a day and tries to escape the hospital to the point he injured himself a little and my mom and nurses who tried to stop him. 

They don’t really know why he’s like this other than what they call “hospital delirium” 

I don’t know if this is the end or not. I wanted my dad to be at my wedding ceremony (already married but wanting to celebrate), but him being sick has taken precedence over that. We thought about being married in the hospital but I’m not sure if it’s a good idea because it’s such a sad time right now.

I’m so worried about my younger sister she graduated college and has no job yet, and my mom. They have no way to support themselves financially. My dad doesn’t have life insurance.

Hi, I hope this is ok to post. One of my closest friends had a baby about 6 months ago, 3 months after I gave birth. In the middle of her pregnancy, her husband was diagnosed with cancer. They’ve decided today to stop treatment because he has not been responding to it. 

Her closest friends and I are hoping to fly out to see her very soon. I want to balance being there for them with giving them their time and space. I also want to know if there are any gifts we can send, chores we can outsource for them, or other things we can do from out of state to provide additional support and relief before and after we are able to physically be there with her. We’ve been sending gift cards for food delivery so they don’t have to cook, and are considering sending baby supplies. There was a gofundme collected for them so hopefully they are not struggling financially, but we want to provide any additional support or relief in some small way however we can. Is there anything that we may not realize is on her plate we can somehow help alleviate? In other circumstances I would send food, or alcohol, or something sentimental, but under these circumstances I don’t think any of those things would be helpful. 

Again, I’m sorry if this is inappropriate to ask here and I don’t want to invade or take advantage of this community. Please let me know if you’d like me to delete. Thank you for letting me post here.",2020-03-11 05:37:54

My mom is being treated for cancer right now. Am I being selfish by considering traveling? There are lots of factors so I hope I don't forget anything.

1. My mom has gotten cancer for the 4th time (due to immuno-suppressants from a kidney transplant in 2009) and this time she is doing chemo and radiation. She started chemo in January and the radiation last week, which will go for 7 weeks (until mid April). She has a great support group and is doing well. 

2. My dad died last year suddenly, and it's been really hard for me for a number of reasons I won't get into. Many of my friends dipped and I've felt very alone. 

3. My boyfriend is great but he's Irish and long distance is really hard for me, though we've been together for two years now and try to see each every few months. Unfortunately he's trying to find a job and thus cannot visit me in the next few months. 

4. Things are bad for me right now so I'm trying to plan a trip! My mom is supportive of this, and we've talk about it at length, but says she cannot make the decision for me. She's been sick all my life but is very strong and healthy most of the time. I want to do what is best for her but I try to balance that with my own interests. I do help her when I can but my depression/anxiety makes it difficult (I feel awful about this all the time so please don't be mad at me). 

5. Airports are germ havens + the virus apparently has a long incubation period. 

6. Will I regret not traveling now because the spread of the virus might get much worse in the summer or fall?

679,Did you seek therapy? I’m still a mess.,6,fbj9hr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/fbj9hr/did_you_seek_therapy_im_still_a_mess/,13,1583039926.0,"Did any of you seek therapy to help you through? Was it helpful?

It’s been 2 weeks and I’m struggling to cope with the news of my Mum’s cancer (stage IV). I try to put on a brave face but I cry most days. She wants to know that I will be okay. I can’t say that I will because she is my best friend and I can’t imagine my life without her in it. This is my worst nightmare. I am going to see my doctor tomorrow to see if there is anything he can give me to help with the panic I have been feeling. I know there is nothing that can help heal the heartache and the shock. 

Yesterday, I laid in bed all day. All I could think was I’m wasting precious time but I just could not get up and this makes me feel so guilty. I did eventually get up and go around to my parent’s and we had dinner together. 

I know googling is bad and I’ve been trying to avoid doing that, but it’s all bad news. But then I feel like maybe stage IV is wrong, the cancer is on her kidney and in her pelvis and a little bit in her hips. Not in other organs. Could it not be worst case scenario? Can’t they just take out the kidney and zap the bone cancer? I don’t know if this is denial or hopefulness. There’s still a bone biopsy to be done to determine whether it’s one cancer or different types. They said the oncologist said that kidney cancer is one of the ‘better’ cancers to treat (but has already said treatable but not curable). He also said that if the bone cancer is from the kidney, that’s a better scenario. I don’t know how much time we are talking and I honestly don’t want to know.

I feel sick about it. I have never been so stressed in all my life. I have lost interest in eating. I haven’t watched TV in 2 weeks. I have been sleeping a lot. In between I’ve been going to work. I was a couple of hours late the other day because when my alarm went off, I couldn’t even keep my eyes open. Work has been really supportive and understanding and have told me to do whatever I need to do. My manager genuinely cares about my wellbeing, as do my colleagues. I just seem to be operating on autopilot. I know none of this is helpful to my Mum but I’ve been trying to do practical things, making a family calendar so that we all know what is happening and when. Picking up medications for my parents. Ironing. Cleaning up. Being the clown that I am to make them smile. I just can’t talk to my sisters about this because they are as heartbroken and shocked as I am and I can’t afford to completely breakdown because I may not restart again. 

It is just so hard to reconcile that she is so sick, because she looks so well.",2020-03-01 05:18:46

My grandfather was diagnosed with stage 4 liver/ colon cancer over the summer. He was doing chemo through 2nd week in December and it was keeping it contained and the chemo didn't seem to be hurting him too badly. He was supposed to be moving and switching chemo centers but a house sale fell through last minute and it didn't happen. The rescheduling of his next chemo got pushed out 2 weeks further. I'm not totally positive if it was just the doing of the dr office or if he pushed it out further as well. Anyway, in that time frame, it spread. They now believe it's in his bone marrow, his lymph nodes and his kidneys. He never got another chemo treatment and has officially ended chemo as, at this point, it won't do anything positive for him. I feel so angry at the dr for putting his chemo off an extra two weeks and letting it spread! I don't even actually know if it was the drs fault/ choice but I guess I need someone to blame and be angry at. I've never lost someone so close to me and it hurts so bad! At his last appointment, prior to his last scan, the dr said 3 to 6 months. He goes this Friday for a face to face with the dr for an updated time frame. I'm not handling this very well. I feel as though I'm already grieving losing him and that it's morbid and not okay. I feel selfish for being so sad for myself because I can't begin to imagine how my grandmother, his wife of over 50 years, and my mother are feeling. This is the craziest mix of emotions I've ever felt. On top of that, I keep reminding myself that he's the one living knowing that he doesn't have much longer so how minuscule is my grief when I get to continue living and he has to wake up every morning knowing his fate. I just needed somewhere to type this all out and vent. Thank you.",2020-01-21 10:10:17

After his last surgery in October, he started to have no short term memory and constantly throwing up. He had to take time off his job as a wills and trust lawyer, which he hated. Right before Christmas, after his local doctors dropped the ball over and over again, seeming like they were just waiting for him whither away, his wife and our family had him moved to Mayo in Phoenix, where they discover his cancer had turned to glioblastoma and had taken over most of his brain. They told us we would have 2-5 weeks with him.

I switch between so many emotions daily. This ducking disease is stealing my brother, who can no longer walk and can hardly speak. I hate seeing him in pain, but I’m not ready to lose him. I know no one is ever ready to lose the people they love, but he’s 31 with 4 young children. It’s not fair.

In the meantime they’re gonna do an X-ray next week to see if it’s spread to her lungs.

He's had to have ostomy surgery and now has two stomas and two bags. He's been taking chemo, plus other meds every other week since last year.

Of course I did in some way. In July she was told she had 1-2 years left. At that point I kind of figured something was really up. In October she had her last appointment where she found out it has been growing quickly and now the time frame was unforeseen. Before this she had been in bed and not really getting up and about. She had stopped eating meals, only once a day, and it was obvious that she was depressed. Then it has been downhill from there. We had to admit her to the hospital because we found out she hadn't been taking her medicine in awhile. We don't even know when she stopped. I was trying to give her space, but that was my mistake.  


Now that week/weekend was a blur for me. My niece from New York came home. My oldest niece was by my side. It felt surreal to me with all the things happenings. Hospice was called. We had to move her bedroom to the living room. So much to set up and deal with. It was so much to deal with and still is. Slowly my mother has been declining and it's been getting worse this past week.  


She has no appetite. She only eats when we are about to give her medicine or when she randomly wants some certain food. She has been getting more confused about things. She can't leave her bed anymore because she's weak.   
When I found out she didn't have long to live, I was a mess. I cried every day. I was just hysterical even at random times. Now I find myself numb. I want to cry. I want to vent, but sometimes it doesn't happen. I have several others here with me in the house to help which is very good. I just feel alone though. I have never dealt with grief or losing someone so close to me. I'm so scared when it finally happens. I've never been super close to my mom as we have had a relationship with a lot of ups and downs.   


I'm trying to be here, but honestly, I don't know what to do. She sleeps downstairs in the living room and sleeps most of the day and is alert at some points of the day. I have read some articles telling me to just sit with her and talk. I've tried asking about tv, music, coloring. If anyone could offer me advice on anything I can do, please please do.   


There is so much going through my head. Today we had her sign the POA papers which just made me feel awkward because this is very overwhelming. I also want to state that I am not trying to shame my mom or sound rude with anything I said. I am just very stressed with everything. I love my mom even through our strained relationship.

I've been reading through it the past few days. He's 19 and was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Initially, they thought it was stage II, but his test results on Friday showed it's stage IV. His oncologist says the prognosis is good, but is concerned it's spread to his bones. He says even if it has, he's still confident of a positive outcome. I don't know all the details. My cousin and his parents are a few hundred miles away, so I've had to get this news secondhand from my mom. (Not that I'm complaining about it, I don't expect my aunt and uncle to broadcast everything and worry about that while their family is going through this.)

My grandmother hosts Christmas every year, with my big extended family. We're a tight-knit group. She's in PA with the majority of my extended family. My immediate family and I are in VA, and my cousin and his family are in TN. My cousin is starting chemo very soon and won't be able to come to the Christmas gathering. (Of course, everyone in my family would be willing to come to TN for him in a second, but he can't be around a lot of people because his immune system will be weakened.) Of course, provided him and his family are up to it (both physically and emotionally), we can skype them into the festivities. But I wanted to think of more ways to make this more of a normal, or at least good, holiday for him.

I did have one idea. I was thinking everyone in the family could make or buy an ornament with some of his favorite things, and things to do with inside jokes and stuff, so they can hang on his tree at home and we'll have a little piece of us there with him. I don't know if that's silly. What do you think of that? Is it silly? Any other ideas?

But after a certain point, I realized my friends may not be able to understand and I might make them uncomfortable.
  In July, my mom had felt around her breasts and had found a mysterious lump. She went to the doctor, and after a biopsy and ect, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Thankfully, she found it so early that it wasn’t even at stage 1. So she had surgery a month later and got it removed, and I thought “thank god, it’s over.”
  Oh boy was I mistaken.
 Yesterday, I came home after a school club trip, only to find my mom trying to stop crying while my father consoled her. Honestly, I thought nothing of it (of course I cared though) as she tends to breakdown and cry quite often. She told me to tell her about my day, which I did but she kept crying through it. I knew something was up.
   After incessantly asking her what was wrong, she told me the Cancer is still there, and got worse. “It’s an aggressive type,” She said, “I start chemo in a week or so, and I’ll be doing it for 4 months followed by radiation. I’m also taking a year off work.” She also explained her survival rate was high. 
   I think after a few months of dealing with this, everything sort of hit me. I started crying the hardest I’ve ever cried—I was scared. I had seen my grandma survive cancer only for it to comeback and watch her die. Same with my two grandfathers. In that moment, everything I saw came back and I saw it in my mom. For the first time in a while, I had a panic attack, I couldn’t stop hyperventilating and crying. I wanted to be strong for my mom but just...I’m terrified.

It was a shock to our family as she’s been healthy her whole life besides a benign brain tumor from 5 years ago that was successfully taken out but damaged her hearing nerve so she only has one good functioning ear. I just find myself so angry that this is her life now. She’s such a strong amazing woman and it hurts to see her struggling and not herself. She’s going through chemo and radiation right now and the plan is to avoid surgery as the tumors are near her vocal cords. She’s on a pain regimen now as she can’t sleep and she has bad mouth sores from the chemo and radiation combo. We’ve been able to avoid a feeding tube by keeping up on the Boost and protein shakes. As we near the end of treatment I don’t feel as relieved as I’d like to, because it seems like she will still be in recovery well into fall. I just can’t wait to have my mom back. I got married this summer and I’m thankful she was able to be there, but sad because she was in pain and not herself. I just hope that she can get through this mostly unscathed.

He has been consistently cheating on her since their wedding, had taken loans against their 401k, lied about it, and then bailed when she handled the taxes. The divorce was going through as amicably as possible because they had a 10 year old daughter. Before she passed away they had a agreed custody arrangement where she had my niece during the week and he had weekends and some weeks in the summer. My sister was in talks with her lawyer about setting up custody in the event that she passed and that my parents or my husband and I would become my nieces guardians and assume the same custody arrangement. 

Well, she passed unexpectedly before that got finalized. 

Now my brother in law has full custody. 

We have gone from seeing my niece frequently to almost not at all. 

We had a big family reunion scheduled on our side of the family in two weeks- we plan these every year and he had the date marked on his calendar and we had already talked about taking my niece. Instead he booked a trip for them and she will not be coming. 

I miss my sister. I miss my niece. I don’t know how to go about navigating this new relationship. I am planning on reaching out to him to see if we can take her more often- but I just am still so angry. I blame him for her heart giving out. He left her and she was alone.

It is also the first time I have actually sat down to mull it over ... properly ... on my own.
My dad was originally diagnosed with stage 4 invasive bladder cancer in January this year, after 4 years of battling with the doctors about his ill health and they kept putting it down to the flu or multiple urine infections. When in fact, it was worse than what we could’ve ever dreamed.
As of this month his cancer care team and specialists from the hospital have informed myself and the rest of the family that it has now spread into his liver, blood steam and bone. And from this they say he will be lucky to see the end of the month due to the aggressive nature of the cancer. 
Since I found out I have just felt numb for lack of a better word. I feel as though I am just going through the motions trying to keep it together not only for my dad but my mum, sister, son and the rest of the family. Im the one making sure things are going according to his palliative care plan, making sure my mum is taking her medication so she won’t have a heart attack again from all of the stress, making sure my sister takes a beat so that she sits down to have a meal and making sure my little boy doesn’t fall out of love with his incredible super hero of a papa!
Which leaves me here. Finding myself talking to all of you because there doesn’t seem to be anyone here to hold me while I cry or scream or miss meals because I’m too busy keeping it together for the sake of everyone else.
What hurt most today was the realisation that he won’t get to see his grandson grown up, see me or my sister learn to drive, get married or come to christmas dinner and sit with everyone round the table. He won’t be there to answer the phone and listen to me ramble on about my day.

How do you balance living your life with spending quality time so you don’t put your life on complete pause but don’t regret not spending time before it’s too late. After hearing from the hospice nurse took a weekend for my own personal mental health and already feeling guilty about it. Had traveled to be there the last 2 weekends and have plans to be there the next 2 weekends. Any tips on how to manage this? The oncologist said to expect a timeline of weeks to months but I feel uneasy to guilty of taking time for my well being knowing his days are limited. Any suggestions would be appreciated. I feel like I’m falling apart completely and emotionally, physically, and mentally exhausted. 

Already in therapy and on medication to help deal with it but after this week and the decision to discontinue chemo it barely feels like it takes the edge off.

Edit: I keep hearing about someone’s cousin’s uncle’s friend’s sister’s acquaintance who made it 7 months on hospice but that doesn’t seem to be realistic at all. Also Father’s Day is in 2 weeks so that’s going to be a rough one either way.",2019-05-31 15:23:39

We now know he was discharged *with* his CT result card that stated he had growths in major organs too - though no one presented this information; he found it in with his medication a couple of weeks later and obviously got quite a shock.

At his follow up appointment the doctor remarked something along the lines of it seemed amazing he didn’t look like he was at deaths door, considering his results (again - results he had to discover himself, after mistakenly handing it over to the pharmacist with his sharps - the pharmacist reading it and insisting he take it back).

It’s been approx 4 weeks since the follow up appointment and he has a follow up endoscopy and MRI of the liver this week.

The drawing out of this uncertainty is very upsetting for us all - he has no date for a follow up appointment, post tests, yet.

I was due move abroad in the next month or so  for a new job I took before we found out about all this - so I’m stuck working from home, alone, and feeling a little overwhelmed I guess.

Turns out that when the abcess ruptured it spread the cancer cells on a portion of my colon and possibly my abdomen.  Apparently the cancer cells that are just chilling on my colon dont have a blood supply so they will not respond to chemotherapy.  I will have to travel to San Diego (12 hour drive)  to have a portion of my colon removed and another procedure that will raise my body temp in order to kill these dumb cancer cells.

My strong father, my return point, my safe house... when I moved away to another country and got married he told me ""no matter how things turn or how far you are, you can always come home to me"".

He was diagnosed with an agressive bladder cancer 3 years ago, doctors removed it, gave him chemo and the next year it was back, stronger and bigger. Same thing, just this time he got a sepsis while recovering on the hospital.

He is very stubborn, that is what the doctor told him when he recovered from that, one kidney was the cost. Chemo didnt sit well with him, food was hard to keep inside, pain on his stomach and a stroke.

Still he kept pushing. Always strong, always smiling when i video call him but he looks like the cancer had aged him, he looks tired sometimes, he looked scared and nervous.

Today he was told the cancer is back, even without a bladder, he still has the same cancer lurking. He had just gotten his hair back. I know he is scared, I am scared too and I am so far away from him.

I refuse to look up the stages and all that but I know it’s not great. It may sound naive but I choose to believe that a miracle can happen no matter the odds.

Anyway, my immediate problem is that my mother is constantly in pain. I know this is basically a given with chemo but I try to be there for her and I know there are people out in the universe with much more knowledge on this than I have. I genuinely am at a loss. Everything I say I can feel coming off as condescending or vomit-y. 

Her shoulders are always hurting. I bought her wrist weights and when she lost those I suggested water bottles or something to build strength. But many times the pain is too much for her. Keep in mind this is a woman who never complains and has a very high tolerance for pain.

She is so depressed. She’s always crying and I try to be soothing, comfort her. Rub her back and shoulders. I try to say some things or suggest we watch a movie. Sometimes she goes along and sometimes she says she won’t stay up or be comfortable or something. She cries all the time and I don’t know how to help her. She’s crying because she doesn’t want to be sick. But I can’t change that. I am here to keep her spirits up but how do I do anything when she is too weak and depressed to do anything fun? Too tired to watch anything uplifting? Too bloated to leave the house?

She sees a psychiatrist. A nutritionist was recommended, but we have yet to meet with her. I’ve been bringing it up lately. None of us really cook. Most of the things she can stomach are probably not recommended in her condition. But she is a pretty picky eater.

I don’t know what I’m looking for here, but I am at a loss and if anyone has been in a similar situation, has any tips or tricks, I would be eternally grateful. This is so hard and I would never wish this on anyone.

How do you deal with having a family member with incurable cancer but they were abusive to their family when we were younger? 

We’ve “reconciled” as in the rest of us just moved on and sweep it under the rug but it’s still hard to deal with the lasting impacts of the abuses while still feeling love towards them.  And I hate the fact that towards the end in the future, how much it’ll personally hurt to see them suffer and dying from cancer but still dealing with all the past anger and resentment towards them. 

I hate that they will have the control and power over me forever.  

And before someone jumped on saying it’s not right. Abused victims will never and can’t just “get over it” towards their abuser. We will always have PTSD and other mental repercussions from it. We just learn how to cope and deal with it, especially if it’s close family member we still maintain relationships with. 

Am I the only one feeling this way? I don’t even know if I’m expressing this correctly.

I went through chemo and radiation once before.  All testicular or in that vicinity.

Don't make the same mistakes I did.  I went through my first treatment in Orlando and the facility, which is no longer around, bullied me into paying my chemo on a credit card since I didn't have the money to pay for it.  Don't ever do this!  Get more opinions, check everywhere for treatment options and ways to pay.  I'm still dealing with all of those bills to this day.  Cards are maxed anymore but it's been hard to pay them down going through it twice since then.

Also, I thought I was in the clear, so we bought a house in April 2018.  My wife's disabled so it was virtually all through my income that we were able to get a home for our family.  When I started having my latest issues in August, it took a couple of months to figure it out and then another month to get the money together for surgery once the tumor was found.  Thankfully still stage 1.

All of the Dr visits, tests, and finally surgery basically put us in the hole with our mortgage and even though at first the bank said they'd work with us, when I submitted the application for modification, we were denied because our loan was too new, less than 12 months old.

It's been disheartening getting the foreclosure letter.  I'm basically riding out being 60 days behind and trying to work OT and hope that a tax return will get us a month closer to being back on time.  I'm still making payments just we are two months behind.  My credit is shot being behind two months and high usage on my credit cards.  Can't get a modification, no FHA title 1 loan, can't tap my 401k.  Running out of options.

My point is, if you speak with anyone about a bill, get names, write down times and dates, who you spoke to, everything.  Don't just accept that they may have notes your account, because that doesn't always happen and you get screwed.  I started a GoFundMe account and thankfully that's helped as we're almost to 43% now.  

Just make sure you talk about finances long and hard if you have a diagnosis.  Think short and long term and double check all the info you're given.  I don't wish this stress on anyone and most deft not on someone diagnosed or recovering from cancer.",2019-01-23 18:53:21

Any insights?",5,adl0dx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/adl0dx/mom_suffering_from_stage_4_ovarian_cancer_and/,3,1546917069.0,"So this is my first post in this sub. I've been thinking about doing it, but I'm really, *really* good at avoiding talking about this because, in my mind, if I don't see or hear it about it, everything must be ok. I'm trying to get better.

My mom was diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer last April, so we're approaching a year. I can't remember what medicine they started her on, but they were getting the results they had hoped, so about 4 months ago they started her on abraxane - once a week for 3 weeks, followed by one week off.

I live about 3 hours away, so I don't get to see her every day. (My brother and our aunt live in the same city, so she's got some solid support.) Last night my mom told me that she'd been waking up in the middle of the night just drenched from night sweats. She says it's been going on for a while, that she gets these a few times a week.

She said she's mentioned it to her doctor, but I'm not certain. Is anyone familiar with this? Is anyone aware of something like this happening?

Thanks in advance for the input. ",2019-01-08 03:11:09

My step mother slipped and injured her hip. After x-rays, scans, and tests related to the fall they found the cancer. It had caused lesions on her bones. A lot of them. The doctors moved forward with chemo. We were hopeful and things were looking good. Then it started spreading. She applied for special trials. Only to find out she had a strain they could not help with. She went to the Cancer Center of America with hopes they could help. Unfortunately they were not able to help either. She and my Dad raised $35,000 for her to go to Mexico to try another type of treatment. It seemed like it was working. About 2 weeks after she returned things started to go downhill again. That was this last fall. Earlier this week she received the news. They have given her 4-6 months... 

Today she and my Dad came by. She wanted to gift some items, special to her, to my 3 children. They have known she had cancer, but I has not told them the recent information. I didn’t want them to be crying while she was here. I wanted them to have happy thoughts because that is what I want her to have. After they left I decided I needed to explain what was happening. It was so hard. Thinking of it is hard, but speaking it is so much harder. My children are heartbroken. They love her so much.

She was fine and active for most part, just had a headache. This is an 89 year old woman who would walk a mile every morning, go up and down steps without a problem, no fall ever, cook full blown meals, do hours of yard work.... reduced to the bed, struggling to speak and move, within the last week. We tried treatments that we’re unsuccessful. Last was radiation on one of her areas about a two months ago. A few months ago, maybe three, we were told that she doesn’t need cancer medication any longer and gave her about 5-6 months. A few weeks ago my brother, a cooking fool, came to visit and was able to get her appetite up to where she was asking for cakes and pies and eating decent for her state for majority of his stay. Now the last three days, she barely eats. Also every swallow brings coughing. She’s told my mother she wants to die, too exhausted to go on, twice in last couple of days. I see it, quite frankly I understand. Would I be devastated, yes! However I’m not a selfish person, I live in reality. If I myself had the choice I’d go the minute I was stuck in bed. That’s no way to live. We will be hurt when she goes, however relieved. I have noticed some things these past days of watching her. Are the following signs of pre or active dying? She breaths heavy, says she is not uncomfortable though. Can barely swallow. Unable to lift herself(was able to about two weeks ago) Sleeps all day. Speaks low and not clearly. Something new: seems to be talking in her sleep. It started today. It’s like she’s dreaming. It was in a rhythm like she was pleading or singing. I would go in the first couple times, but quickly realized she was not calling for help as she said she was fine and comfortable. So I began to just listen for my name or my mothers name to know when to go in. It’s very unnerving though. She also was more clear when speaking out during these times. Can anyone shed some light on this? Is she at the end? Is it possible she will regain strength if we take her to a facility rather than keep her here? She wanted to stay in her home, but I wonder if that is the right choice. I guess being told you will die in half a year at 89 is more promising than just a slim possibility of getting better. Just don’t know what to expect. The good thing in all this, she’s not in pain. Just tired",2020-11-02 08:46:05

I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian a few days ago. She was healthy as a horse, until all of a sudden she wasn't. I have a very sickly father, and we always assumed he would pass before she would, and she would get to enjoy life. I live in Hong Kong and they are all in the USA and we all had a family FT while they told me. 

I want so badly to be near her right now - to hold her hand, to tell her she's got me and that I love her. My dad and my little brother (just graduated college) are so good but honestly ehy are both depressed/depressing to be around and my family has always counted on me to be the positive energy/glue to the family, even though I moved away 3.5 years ago. I just turned 27. I feel really hopeless.

Because of COVID, coming home to the states to visit is an enormous ordeal. Quarantining, getting proper testing, making sure I don't bring anything to my mom while she is having chemo. I pray that I could be by her side if she goes, but there's almost going to be no chance of it - she needs my happy and positive energy around her. I texted her today, just praying that she texted me back (which she did, with a lot of ""i love you""s).

I also can't leave my job in HK for that long (I haven'd told them yet, but will tell them this week). It's like every feeling I had prior to the diagnoses was so carefree - and now I feel like I'll never be OK ever again.",2020-10-26 23:00:47

I don't know how to handle it, how to handle the uncertainty, the bad news and the waiting times. It is a bit of a rant I just needed to write it.

My (F 20s) father (M 50s) was sent to the emergancy room on the 4th of september. He had multiple health complaints including not being able to eat and sweating a lot. They expected lymphoma.

In the first week the doctors did some scans/tests. After a week they presented the results. It was a large mass/tumor behind the some organs. They said he needed surgery and he would talk to a sergeon on monday. They also found a small other spot wich was mysterieus.

Monday the sergeon told them he first wanted to do more tests. 

He needed a biopsy. He got that bioptie on that friday, the thursday after he recieved the results. It was bad. It is a rare and agresive type of sarcoma with a high recuring rate. It is unlikely that he will gett totaly clean and that the cancer will never return. 

The message of the doctors that day was the same as a week earlier, he probably needs surgery but first we want to do more tests.

Next tuesday some doctors had a discussion about the small spot. Today we got the 'results' of de discussion, and it is effectively the same 'He needs surgery but we want to do more tests'. They want to biopsy the smal spot before deciding on the surgery. The biopsy might* take place on tuesday. The results of this biopsy will take 2 weeks.

In the meanwile he is constantly in pain, is sleeping more than he is awake, barely eats and has lost 20 kg in the last month.

It has already been a month of uncertainty, waiting, receiving bad news, waiting some more and receiving more bad news. Now we have to wait another 2 1/2 weeks before we will get more news, until they will hopefully finally have a treatment plan.

How can I handle this uncertainty?
How do I handle probably losing my father?

* they could not reserve a bed because a lot of beds are reserved for covid patients, it could be even later if the bed is needed for covid patients.",2020-10-03 01:17:08

All I know is that she's not terminal.

For the past month she was taking tests and I thought yesterday she was finally going through with chemo on Monday but then today I found out she won't go through with it. Instead she'll pursue a different kind of treatment where, from how I understand it, is like some hard-core 60 day detox where she'll starve the cancer cells. She'll be consuming organic vegetables and have like lymphatic massages. This treatment has had success stories at least. I know it's not a ""spa treatment"". She'll be losing so much weight because her body won't be gaining any but at first glace it really sounds like a glorified spa treatment.

I don't know. I'm skeptical but I'm not telling her don't do that just go through with chemo because she has a right to her treatment and she believes with her whole being that this will cure her and she'll survive and fight the cancer this way. I'm not stopping her but I'm so frustrated because if these 60 days becomes the difference between terminal or not, I don't know if I'll be able to accept that decision.

I want to support her and be there for her in person because I can but in all honesty, I just want to hide and run away. I know chemo has really bad side effects and she's scared of chemo and I can't force her to take chemo but I have more faith in chemo than the treatment she's choosing to pursue. I know her and she's thought really hard about it and she's pushing through with it no matter what. 

I just can't stop all the what ifs in my head though. ""What if this doesn't work and she just wasted 2 months?"" or "" what if she gets worse during those two months?"" or ""what am I gonna do if she dies?""

She's asked me to pray for her and she has a real close relationship with God. She believes everything happens for a reason and that God can save her and has given her all of these blessings and God will never abandon her, but I can't get behind that. I believe in a god, whether that's Jesus or some other higher power, a god probably does exist, but I don't know if this god really has so much power over this.

This was a nightmare for all of last October as she had to go through multiple surgeries to clean out her abdominal area. She has had an ileostomy bag ever since. She gained enough weight for the surgery but she’s terrified of going back in the hospital for anything so the thought of staying overnight has been freaking her out. Well today is finally the day she’s getting her ileostomy reversed and she is so overwhelmed. I just wish I could help more. I helped pack her bag and made sure she took a small soft blanket for comfort. We always planned that I would stay by her side overnight but COVID has changed that. My dad is going to be by her side during the day but will return to sleep at home since he is on chemo meds as well and we are trying to keep his stress low. I just can’t stop thinking about how this leaves my mom alone for the night and I feel terrible. She has been so nervous and sad while leaving this morning and I just hope some of you can keep her in your thoughts today & send some healing thoughts her way.

Still unsure as to whether the surgery can go ahead (more biopsies and explorations to be carried out in the next few weeks).

We are struggling to help the relative understand about the surgery. They understand that tumour/larynx will be removed and that they won’t be able to speak.

My father died of liver cancer when I was sixteen so he cant help me to deal with all of this. 
 
Shortly after I turned 15 (I just turned 20) my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer and that found metastases in her bones right away, after some radiation and other stuff it turned out she had also some metastases in her liver (so many that they were probably already there when they found the ones in her bones) which are the main problem by now.
She did chemotherapy, one of the hard ones where you lose all of your hair and shit. Since then she's been on and off of different medications, they all work for a while, like 2 weeks or sometimes even a few months but then she has to switch because they stop working.
Today she told me the tumor markes doubled since the last check up (they check them every second week) so it's pretty clear this medication only worked for 5 months. 

She has to switch again and every time she does new side effects appear etc. Also at some point there just won't be any treatment left and I'm so fucking terrified of this day.

When my father was diagnosed it was really soon very clear there isn't much anyone can do for him. They told him he only had about 6-24 months, he died 4 months after the diagnosis so it's harder for me to trust any predictions. 

I'm just really scared of losing her too. My brother's literally on another continent right now and I'm scared of bothering my friends with this new since it's definitely not the first time it happens and it's no surprise it all and it's not like anything really changes since this happened a lot of times before.

He went through chemo and had six sessions which were completed just before lockdown by end of March 2020. The chemo was not an easy thing for him to handle but he got through it. Last Friday before his doctor's appointment he had an Echography and there was a lump in his bladder.

Doctor's advice was to go through surgery again on Tuesday to remove the lump. He also advised for chemo and radiotherapy. Dad is very depressed and is afraid to go through the surgery and chemo again. I am very sad for him, that he will have to suffer again. The issue is that bladder cancer recurrence is 50% and each time he will have to go through all this. I don't know how to help him..",2020-05-31 16:49:02

My fiancee has had IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) since she was quite young. Lately, she's been feeling stitch like pains in her LEFT lower abdomen, so she got a colonoscopy, as well as a CT scan and X-ray scan. The doctors did not find ANYTHING on her left side, but noticed a 15cm growth in her large intestine, right next to her appendix, on her RIGHT side.

We haven't received the biopsy results yet. The problem is that we're not sure if this is a tumor or a benign growth, and the doctors are saying that whatever it is, it will need to be removed surgically. (by cutting out a part of her large intestine, and linking it to the ileum. Now, IF the biopsy results come back and it turns out to be cancer, we will have to worry about it then, but if it is NOT cancer, and just a benign growth, what is the best way to treat this? If anyone has had any similar experiences, please feel free to share some insight on what the problem was, how it was treated, and any side effects or lessons learned during the whole ordeal.

My Pappa’s health deteriorated fast but I knew he wouldn’t have a whole lot of time left when we found out his diagnosis.... he died a week and a half after finding out it was terminal. He went from being active and working in his shop to not being able to walk or move by himself and then passing in less than 2 weeks...... somehow it felt like forever and all of a sudden.... at the same time. My Pappa used to be out of town for oil fields all the time so I grew up being used to it just being my Grandma around the house. It also means I’m much closer with her. I’m used to seeing his things around the house even though he isn’t there. In part this feels like that..... like he’s just put of town and I’m not sure when he’ll be back but that he will be. I know that isn’t true but..... it certainly feels that way. In the days leading up to his death every time I saw an older white man in overalls my heart skipped a beat thinking it was him (which is often when you work at a Walmart in the midwest). I cried and was crushed when I found out but.... ultimately glad he was no longer in pain. He was in so much pain for the months leading up to his death. Even before he showed it to us. I mostly feel numb now.... empty. Trying to clean my house and continue with my life like things are normal. They almost feel normal.... as normal as it can now, I guess, during this pandemic. We have no idea when we’ll be able to hold a funeral. Makes it feel even less real. Seeing my Grandma is heartbreaking. I’m terrified that without him she is going to lose her will to live. She’s like a second mother to me, I was over at her house constantly growing yo after my parents divorced and my mom had to work 3 jobs to support us. As much as I’m crushed over my Pappa I just know it would be worse if she went so soon too. I always thought I’d have longer with them....",2020-04-24 16:20:11

My Mil took me in with open arms, despite dating my husband for three days.

Such a sweetheart that he never even saw how good and special he will and still is.  So we’ve been knowing each other for some years now, and when i got on the app like 5 minutes ago, I’m JUST NOW reading his text about him having the cancer and it sent me numb. 

Like okay, the entire month of February was very hard for me, especially to communicate back to everyone who’s apart of my life, online or in real life. The chances of me SEEING what he sent me on the day  would’ve been slim either way. So me getting upset about it is pointless.    I wasn’t even coherent the entire month, nor did i want to bother anybody with my wowes or concerns. I’m that type of person yes.

So I don’t know if it’s disrespectful to repeat what he said to me, but deep down I don’t want too. What i WILL share is summing up what he basically told me.

#He basically said a year ago (which at that time we wasn’t talking consistently like we used too, so I wouldn’t have known cause he didn’t tell me until February 18th of this year) 

##That he was diagnosed with throat cancer WHICH spread to his hips and back. He’s at stage 4 and has been doing chemo, but he don’t know how long he got. That’s the words he told me, I’m just telling you in the third person cause rereading that message again, i might loose my mind.

But he’s 19 going on 20 I believe since he’s- oh wait yes he was born 2000 even so we are 3 years and some months apart. So he’s still a baby, and our relationship has had it’s up and downs like every other relationship, but he’s been there when I’ve had my worst moments and vise verse. He knows me well, and i know him well. At the time i met him he acted like a bigger brother to me cause my ONLY brother wasn’t even there. So he filled that role, and i just kept him company. We never met, we almost did, but sadly it never happened.

##I was there when he got shot, i was there when he got jumped, i was there when he almost died a few times, and I’ve been there when he was having bad family issues. He’s been there for me woah, I can’t even count the occasions he was there to comfort me for. Theres so many, just like thinking about the times we had good or bad, there’s just so many in the 3 years I’ve known him. I would say of course more good then bad, he broke my heart when he ended the relationship because of stupidity, but we made up. 


And now that he might die, or is already dead just sent me out the box. Like writing this i could cry, but at the same time I’m so numb. He’s so young, has such a nice soul/mind and heart but just doesn’t see it. He never did. Will he die like that? I can’t dwell on it cause he’s not dead. And that’s my belief, he’s just sleeping and i will get to see him again. But i STILL wouldn’t want him to go out like that. Not like that, nor at this time.

How many more people do i have to loose to finally loose myself? I’ve lost so many online friends, and people I’ve known in real life. There’s so many that i feel like i SHOULD be next one so I don’t have to endure anymore deaths. But what i CAN say is, i do believe in God, and i do believe in the dead coming back. So it’s not like I don’t have hope or anything, i DO thanks to my mother showing me about Jehovah god, it’s just still my imperfection that gets to me. I KNOW i can see the people I’ve lost again, but then me being imperfect, i just want to give up and die too.

It sucks that I can’t get up, go take a bus or something (cause he’s in Colorado which isn’t far at all from me) and I WISH i could just be like “mom my friends dying can i go see them?” 
I WISH it were that easy. But I’m not dealt with those cards, and I’m tired of having to tell my friends “hey things are ruff right now and I won’t be on my phone for a while, I’ll text you when im back” i already feel so disappointed in myself for doing that in the past.

#Now i don’t want to let my friends that are still here down anymore. I can still celebrate them right? He k yes!!!!!! I still have people here who i can still talk too. Yes loosing friends are so sad and not fair at all, but the ones who are still here, still matter as well.    I ALREADY missed my friends text about him dying of cancer that i refuse to miss ANYMORE time with anyone of my online friends. Or the people in my life INGENERAL.

So that’s my rant for the night and i just found this subreddit so i thought i would leave it here. If anyone has anything to say I appreciate it. I’m so upset right now and i think i might cry myself too sleep. 

##This one hit hard especially because of how past relationships I’ve had with people mimicked the same type of person Adrian is. I’ve had many friends who were like Adrian and who also didn’t see what i saw. It’s so sad good people get terrible endings, but he and the rest of ALL the people in my life that have passed won’t be remembered by the suffering they went through. They will forever be remembered as how they greatly acted, how kind/sweet/special/loving/ and all of the above they were. They DESERVE to be remembered as the light that we all needed and had at the times we needed it most. 

They were there when we needed them. Moving forward i still have friends who shine light on my life. They make my life happier,  and give me different meanings everyday.

Prior to her cancer diagnosis she had been diagnosed and treated for anxiety, and depression. Still not sure if that’s all of what she has. She was non compliant and non adherent with her mental health care in the past. Never completed therapy or medication. This has been going on forever. 

When she was initially diagnosed with non small cell lung cancer she had a week long psychotic episode. She was paranoid that the doctors and nurses were out to get her, didn’t trust the medicine they were giving her etc. Auditory and visual hallucinations. The works. Her admitting physician finally got psych involved and she was medicated. The psychotic episode has ended, but she is still distrusting and sometimes non compliant. She was placed in rehab after surgery. She’s refusing PT sometimes and refusing meds sometimes. She is extremely depressed, but is better than she was before. She is still under psychiatric care and has been going to counseling daily. She has been taking all of her psych meds. She has only been getting psychiatric treatment for 3 weeks and the effects of the meds take time. Time which she doesn’t really have. 

Her cancer has high levels of the genetic mutation that make it susceptible to effective treatment by Keytruda or other immunotherapy. 

From what I know now, from the rehab nurse, it looks like oncology doesn’t want to treat her at all. Other than palliative care and radiation, no chemo, no immunotherapy, because of her behavior, which is caused by her mental illness, which until now has not been treated.

She does not have brain cancer or dementia. All the docs have checked multiple times, mainly due to her sometimes irrational and erratic behavior. 

We have a meeting on Monday. We are moving her into assisted living after rehab to force a modicum of compliance with care. She is extremely non compliant with me so a facility would be better for her care. I am her only family and only child. My concern is that the docs may not give her a shot at treatment because of her underlying mental health issues. Which she is seeking treatment for, finally. 

She is otherwise competent. Very intelligent and aware of everything that is going on. She is young and if not for the mental health issues should be a candidate for aggressive treatment.

It’s a perfect storm. She’s finally getting mental health care but it may be to late. I know she wants to do treatment and will be devastated if that option is off the table.

It was devastating news. My mom is my best friend, we are so incredibly close. But she didn’t give up, she fought. She did multiple rounds of chemo and radiation. It shrunk the cancer, it gave us all hope. In January of 2019 she had her first operation on her liver. They had successfully removed 90-95% of the cancer. 

They let her heal, then brought her in to laser away the rest on her liver sometime a few months later. 

Then in October of 2019 they operated on her colon, removing a good portion of her colon. Leaving her with a stoma. 
This was the toughest part for her to get use to. She hated it, even so we all were stupidly hopeful. We thought she had beat it, we really fucking did— or at least I did.

They sent her home to heal. She began having issues with her kidneys, which they eventually attached a bag to it to drain it. During all of this she was going in for tests and ct-scans, again, I was hopefully. 

December 23rd the doctor calls, they tell us it’s returned... worse than it was before. They said she could begin chemo in the new year to extend her life the best they could. 

I was in denial, I refused to believe she couldn’t beat this. I kept insisting that once she starts chemo she will beat it. 

Once mid January came around, my mom broke the news to me. That she is not going to do chemo. 

Now I’m in an absolute state of despair. I feel as though I’m drowning. I’m lost.

I am struggling because we have never been really comfortable talkers together. We love each other and have said so much a few times, but I am pretty weird about emotions, and I don’t want him to think that I am ungrateful for all of the wonderful thing he has done for me.

So far we have come up with the following list of things, but wondering if there are anymore ideas that might help make him a little more comfortable and entertained.

Comfy sweatpants and sweatshirt
Cozy blanket
Sudoku books
Woodworking/nature magazines
Kindle gift card 
Ginger candies
Peppermint candies 
Trail mix


Any other ideas are greatly appreciated, thank you!",2020-01-14 04:02:03

They caught it early, he underwent surgery and some treatment, and beat it. I was about 20 then, and it was scary, but we were confident he’d pull through. 

5 years later, he suffered a stroke that left him permanently disabled. 

Today, I found out that they found an aggressive form of melanoma in his arm. He is currently awaiting more tests to determine how serious it is, how far it has spread, and what treatment options are. 

Several years ago, his  best friend passed away as a result of melanoma. I am at a total loss. I am vacillating between hope and despair. I’m at work right now and don’t feel comfortable talking about it with anyone I know.  I’m not sure why I’m even making this post. I just need to get this out.

801,Uncle diagnosed later than he should’ve been. Just some questions...,5,efqtu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/efqtu3/uncle_diagnosed_later_than_he_shouldve_been_just/,1,1577363567.0,"Hey all,

So my uncle has been diagnosed a few weeks ago with lung cancer. He is very shy about it now— doesn’t like to talk about it, doesn’t like to go out of the house, etc. (which is all understandable). I don’t want to push him on these subjects so perhaps some of you could fill me in on some questions I have. Honestly, I don’t even know what stage of lung cancer he’s in.

So, he had a bad cough for about 9-10 months before diagnosis. They kept thinking it was pneumonia, bronchitis, etc because it’s been 10 years or so before my uncle stopped smoking. Approximately what stage could he be in for him after 9 or 10 months after symptoms begin showing? He’s lost a lot of weight and looks worse for wear— part of which his wife blames on his medication.

What are some ways I could possibly comfort him? I know a few of his hobbies, such as riding his motorcycle and soccer, but I don’t think he can really participate in those anymore. He’s taking some sort of medication and whatnot, but it’s not looking very good. 


I found out about a week before thanksgiving. He hasn’t come to any family events (mainly thanksgiving/Christmas) since. I hopefully am going tomorrow to visit him with my dad tomorrow and see him for the first time since I’ve heard the news. What can I say to him to comfort him? Is there anything I can do to get him out of the house? Is there anything I can do to be with the rest of his family? He’s the oldest of 8 and all of my aunts and uncles are very close, which is why I was hoping to see him at our family parties.


If you have any other advice that don’t specifically answer my questions, please give it. Thanks,",2019-12-26 12:32:47
802,My mom is dying,3,eeqze1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/eeqze1/my_mom_is_dying/,1,1577165747.0,"I cannot handle this. We had a strained relationship because she was an alcoholic and burnt our house down when I was young and then her and dad spent the money on hotels and drugs. We were broke in months and as a result we lived in a van and I was taken out of school in elementary school.
She fucked my life up a lot. I have bad issues with self esteem and let people treat me bad because I think I’m lucky to have them. 
I repeated the domestic violence cycle. 
I got out. I wanted to fix things with her and then I find out she’s got cancer and her dr tells me she’s got 2-4 months. I’m trying to cope with that and the she gets pneumonia.
Now she’s in a coma in the hospital and can’t breathe on her own. I’ve been here trying to make my peace. I wanted to tell her so many things but I didn’t get to.
I’ve been in a spin since this happened and have fucked off everything else because I can’t cope. I have a lot to fix now. I just cannot believe this is happening.

I just need to vent. 

from the time I was 5 I have a lot of bad memories
My first one being my dad yanking my sister and I from our beds and running out of the house holding us and she screamed she was going to blow her brains out if he divorced her while holding a shot gun to her head. Crying.
The next day coming home and there’s a bullet
Hole in the roof of my room. She says she missed and it’s a sign from god. I see it every day and feel not good enough. 

We got out on a church fundraiser... expect it isn’t really one. We sell these church books for a fundraiser and they keep the money. I hate lying and feel horrible. 
She buys me a yoohoo and apple at the end every time.
She goes behind the car and ask for my yoohoo and I see her take a shot and chase it. I am 5 but I know what she’s doing is bad and I feel scared. 

The next day we drive around a lot and she drinks. 
She leaves us in the hot car and we are so thirsty so I get out and interrupt her and ask for a drink. 
She grabs me by my leg and uses it to flip my body to spank for interrupting adults.
She’s drunk. She accidentally breaks my leg doing this.
She realises what she’s done and drives us around for hours instead of going to the hospital and tells me if I don’t tell them I was fighting with my sister over a toy and broke it that way that they will put me in foster care where someone will rape me and I’ll never see my family again.
We drive around for over 8 hours while I cry in pain until she finally calls my dad and tells him what happened and he takes me to get a cast. I lie. The hospital seems to know. 


They divorce. They come in and each make their case on who I should
Live with. I pick my dad because even this young I can feel that my mom isn’t stable. 
She comes in and breaks a rose we have her to
Pieces and says I do not love her.
It hurts.

She disappears. 
She comes back a year later and they act like she was never gone.
She’s a good mom. Things go good.
She relapses. We lose everything.
We move around a lot. I can’t make friends because of it. 
She’s in and out. 
We get stable. She pops up like nothing happened. They buy some businesses and get bad into drugs. 
I basically raise my little sister and we are so hungry often that my reaches start to catch on and take us for meals after class.
I hear them say it’ll be our last night in this house but I don’t understand. 
She’s drunk the next day and I get off the bus to our home burning down and fire trucks and police everywhere.
We live in hotels. They pull me from school to homeschool but it never happens.
Insurance money wasted.
We end up living in a van driving from state to state panhandling. No education. No nothing.

We finally find a place and this family at church gives us a trailer. My mom gets a job and we become really
Close.  She starts to unravel because she thinks my dad is cheating. The woman in the family is after my dad and is convincing him my mom is drinking whine his back. They fight a lot. She takes my mom
To a hotel and pays for a week and stocks the room with alcohol. I never see her again after that. The woman tells us she has left us and she runs off with my dad.  I didn’t find the truth out for years later.

My brother commits suicide after he becomes an alcoholic and ends up in a physical fight with his wife who leaves him. I realise life is short. 
I wanted to tell my mom I don’t blame her. I know she grew up in domestic violence and substance abuse  ended up repeating the cycle. I wanted to share my
Good memories. I know she’s sober now though family and I want her to know my kids.
I get ahold of her and find out that it’s too late. She’s dying. She had emphysema and a brain tumour. She can’t walk. She can’t remember anything at all aside from some of the worst stuff.
At first she’s nasty and doesn’t want to speak to me. 
I am hurt but eventually she says she just doesn’t know me and doesn’t trust my dad who was abusive  to her and so she needs to keep some distance but wants to talk/ I do it. 
She says she doesn’t deserve me but wants to know me. 
And then she gets sick.
She will never meet my kids. I won’t be able
To repair this and just have a normal mom daughter relationship. 
My kids are the world to me and I can’t imagine that she didn’t miss me. I would wake up to her pounding the door drunk and my dad wouldn’t let her in. It would be raining hard. I would sneak her in. I would wake up to her rubbing my hair. Or she would get drunk and go out and beg so she could bring me back special vegetarian freezer meals. He would return them  and she would think she lost them bag while drunk and feel bad. She did love us. She was broken and messed up. She’s sober now but she’s a ghost of herself and she may not make it out of this pneumonia. 
I don’t know what to do. I left my phone at work and didn’t have one until today so I’ve had no contact with anyone really and I just need to get all of this out of
Me. 
I’ve shut everyone out.  All my life. I didn’t want to get hurt so I push people away before they can.


I just cannot believe I  waited too long.
She’s going to die. She’s terminal. 
There’s nothing I can do. I always thought we would fix it one day.

My grandma has been my best friend growing up, I did everything with her. My family is extremely religious and my parents were emotionally abusive. My grandma was my only supporter. We thought the cancer had gone away last December. 
This July, a week after I moved out, I got called back home to have a talk with my family. They told me her cancer was back and had moved to her lungs. The doctors told her she had anywhere from six months to a year to live. 

I know these are my last holidays with her, and it’s really made everything so hard.  I’ve been trying so hard to visit her back home every week but sometimes it’s hard for me to even get out of the house.

I haven’t really dealt with any of my feelings about this, because it’s been really hard to talk about. My fiancé’s been encouraging me to find some kind of therapy or support for all of this, and then I found this page, so I thought it meant something.

808,My dads cancer came back,5,e577ym,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/e577ym/my_dads_cancer_came_back/,5,1575356478.0,"This will be a long story, so I am sorry I'm advance. 

I am 18, and when I was 16 my dad fell ill. He went on a golfing trip with his buddies. Just a fun little getaway. When he got back, he felt a bit sick, just nauseous. So for a few days, we just thought it was the beer and wings he ate with his friends. Lol. 

But then those days turned to weeks, and we were getting concerned. He wasn't eating much. And he was starting to turn yellow, like his eyes and his skin had a tinge. I was worried, but thought it was nothing bad.
My mom took him into emergency, just to make sure everything was ok (we live in a small town). His blood work was all out of wack, and he has lost quite a bit of weight from not eating. 

Because of his blood work results, they did more tests (CT scan). Of course, since we live in a small town, our hospital does not have the materials for more complex testing to be done. So they referred him to the hospital in the largest city close to us, and he had more appointments.

They found a small lump completely blocking his gall bladder duct into the duodenum. There was no bile being secreted, so no oils could be broken down. That is why he was nauseous. They took a biopsy of it.

Of course, me being fairly innocent, thought it was an easy fix of just going down through his mouth to remove the lump (kind of like a gastroscopy, I guess). I was wrong. The doctors were unsure of whether or not it was cancer, so they scheduled him in for the Whipple surgery. They put a stint in his gall bladder so he was comfortable until they could do the surgery. 

My parents left me and my brother and travelled to the bigger city (about 3ish hours away) for the surgery. I was so scared. I guess that is normal, but I felt terrified and scared. I felt like my mind was like a skipping cd, if that makes sense. I was filled with worry for my dad. This was during exams, so I found it difficult to study. Of course, I felt so sad that my dad had to go through this. The whipple is not a small surgery. 

They removed 40% of his pancreas, his gall bladder, and a section of his duodenum. But, when I saw him, he was very much himself. He seemed ok, but thin. 

 he was doing very well. At home, running around, driving. The doctors said his recovery time was remarkably fast. We got the biospy results back, and the lump turned out to be cancerous. I felt so scared, but I remembered ""hey, they got it all out with the surgery. We're good."" They did put him on chemotherapy once a week for three weeks, then off for a week, for 6 months. 

Unfortunately, this made his kidneys sort of crap out, and he needed a urine bag that went directly into his right kidney. I was sad and scared, but they stopped doing the chemotherapy, so I guess that made me feel better. To anyone who has gone through chemo or has had a loved one go through it, I am very sorry. It's a really sad thing using poison to fight cancer.

But, after a while, his kidney function improved, and despite needing a stint in his urethra, the bag and tube were removed.  We were all so happy. He was finally back to normal. He started work, I started graduated and started university, everything was great.

My dad went to get a stint change, which usually caused a UTI. So no surprise when he felt a bit shitty after his latest stint change. But then he got worse. He was taken to the big city hospital, and his liver was not draining properly. They put a bag and tube there to drain it. Then we found out his cancer came back . He stayed in the hospital for a week, then he went home.

He was taken back because the tube got kinked. They fixed it, but he's still in there.

That's what's happening. I am really scared. Uni students know it's finals time but I can't get my mind off my dad. I am worried and I don't know what to do. I live 3 hours away from home, but I just want to see him. He is meeting with the oncologist tomorrow to make a plan of action. I don't want to just skip my finals but I can't seem to do any effective studying. I don't know what to do, and I just want my dad to be ok?  

I'm very hopeful that he will be

Hello everyone! 

So I met this wonderful guy (both 23), we were dating for the past months. We are both scared of experiencing our first relationship, but he seemed since the beginning pretty sure about it (I was the one that wanted to slow down). Last week I decided to talk to him, I told him that I was ready and that I wanted a relationship. He replied that he has mixed feelings and prefers me as a friend, but he insisted that we stay in touch because I was special, that he really likes me… in other words he really wants me as a friend. We have common friends, so I found out that he was really into me, that nobody had seen him so happy and open with a girl and that he hasn’t told anyone about our “breakup”, not even his best friend. 

When we were still dating the boy told me that his mother has cancer, that in the past he suffered a lot, but everything is fine now (he literally told me exactly these words) and avoided any further explanations. A few weeks ago he told me that he had to rush at the hospital because his mother had a surgery and had some complications afterwards (he didn’t told me about the surgery). He told me that everything went well, and that his mother could go home again, so I asked him for other info, I wanted him to talk about it. He replied that he didn’t knew anything else because de doesn’t want to know (about his mothers real conditions) and the discussion ended there. 

I suspect that he is terrorised about loosing his mother (as it should be), he refuses in anyway to face the problem, and he is suffering a lot about it. 

I know that we don’t know each other so well, so I can understand that he doesn’t want to talk with me, but still I want to be his friend and be there if he needs me. How can I help him? I think that he should learn how to face his mother illness, maybe go to a therapist, be open about it and be strong for his mother. This is such a delicate topic, I don’t know how to approach the problem and how to talk without hurting him, I don’t want to make things worse, but I can feel that he is suffering. What should I do? Should I mind my own business and go on with my life? Or I should push a bit, be patient and try to break his walls?

Thank you 😊",2019-11-14 18:58:58

He has AML with acute panmyelosis with fibrosis. He’s been on experimental chemo for last two months (after a year of regular chemo) but has become very weak and is fighting a lung infection that requires an anti fungal medication that can’t be used at the same time as the experimental chemo. He is in between cycles atm (cycles last 25 days on and 3 days off) and they were delaying the start of next cycle so he could have more days on the anti fungal. The dr said today they don’t know how much longer his body will cope with the infection and chemo so they have suggested he come hone from hospital to be with family and friends in a comfortable environment. They can’t give any time frame on how long he’ll live. Mum is hoping a couple of weeks at least. They have been giving him blood and plasma every day or two which I’m sure is helping keep him alive. At this stage it’s not been made clear to me if they will be providing that when he goes home.

2) they’ve technically seen this mass already on a CT scan that they would usually use to diagnose her? (I think) 
3) she has got some symptoms of lung cancer as she’s an ex smoker of 30+ years (but still smokes an e-cig) she has a constant cough and quite often gets a hoarse voice however she is also a functioning alcoholic, she doesn’t drink very often but will binge and I’m not sure if this is where the throat/voice problems come from. (Straight vodka definitely isn’t great for the throat) 

My question is, & I know it might be a question that can’t be answered but wondering about others experiences with diagnosis... if they scan her or whatever they’re gonna do on Friday and they see that it is in fact cancer, will they tell her that day? Or wait until her GP follow up appointment that is booked for the following Monday? Or does it have to be a biopsy? Or does the scan have to go away for a consultant to look at etc. Sorry my brain is in overdrive :( and I just don’t know what the process usually is. Just trying to prepare myself.

*another reason I worry (and what are the chances in this!!?) my parents are separated and I visited my dad at the weekend who told me that he on the same day as mum, has to go to the radiology department at his hospital for a lump that’s grown on his lower chest/stomach (he didn’t specify exactly where but it’s a lump he can physically feel) to rule out “anything sinister”. It just makes me think why is mum at the cancer centre.",2019-09-25 14:50:30

She has presented with multiple complications and has been hospitalized for almost 4 weeks now. Shes now in the ICU after her blood pressure plummeted. The oncologist told her fiance to call family to come and suggested palliative care (she wants to continue fighting it though).

My question is how long does she have based on the oncologist saying what he said? I have been going to visit every week (6 hours away) and was planning next week's visit for next Friday. I dont want to sound cold, but does it sound like I should be leaving much sooner to see her? I also called the oncologist myself and he couldn't discuss much because HIPAA, but he basically said it's not a good idea to wait till Friday. 

I was just hoping for anybody's experience with the ""call the family"" talk from your loved one's doctor.

Thank you in advance for any insight or experiences. I'm pretty frazzled because shes holding her own according to the nurses, and shes coherent, and I just saw her and she seemed so good. It just seems like this can no way be the end, you know?",2019-08-08 10:26:25

Since my dad was diagnosed with a severe and aggressive cancer I’ve pretty much held it together for the sake of my mum, sister and my son. And no one seemed to notice that I was loosing myself a little more each day.

He passed away not even a week after my 24th birthday in June, 6 months after being diagnosed and I think that was the straw that broke the camels back.

Every day tasks and activities make me feel like I’m trying to climb Everest, when really it’s something as simple as just trying to get out of bed to shower.  

I’m having panic / anxiety attacks that are so bad I’ve collapsed and landed in hospital hooked up to all sorts of machines because they thought I’d had a heart attack.

I’m in floods of tears at the simplest of things. Like saying to my son we’re going to gran and papas house, then quickly correcting myself to no just grans house papa’s not home just now. Or even when he asks if he can talk to his papa on the phone and my heart just breaks into a million tiny pieces.

I honestly don’t know how I’ve gone the last 3 weeks without him.

He has a thing about taking pills. He be hates taking them and flat out refuses to. Even though he's writhing in pain, sobbing crying on the floor he will not take pain pills. 

We talked to the doctor about his refusal to take pills and they put him on the fentanyl patch which has been working for him. They also gave him Gabapentin for nerve pain. Those only come in pills.
They prescribed him liquid Prozac for the anxiety, since he won't take pills and he still refuses to take it. I fought with his insurance company for two weeks to get him the liquid Prozac and he refuses. It's a medication that needs to be taken daily, he refuses to take it because he ""hasn't felt any anxiety today"".

I try over and over to explain to him why he needs to take the meds when he does but he gets angry and defensive. His doctors have explained on several occasions why and he nods along and agrees and tells his doctors of course he's going to take them. Then we get home and he refuses. He gets angry, defensive, tells me that he doesn't need medication because he's tired of having so much medicine in his body. He was just diagnosed with Spindle Cell Sarcoma a month ago. He's been on the meds for a month. He just started chemo today and his doctors AGAIN explained the importance of taking his meds and we got home and he refused. 

I am so incredibly frustrated because I have to fight him on everything regarding his medication. I have to fight him to put a new patch on every 3 days. I have to fight him to take the Prozac. I have to fight him to take his nerve pain medication. I have to fight him to take his nausea medication. I am so freaking tired of fighting him. 

It would be one thing if he didn't really need them. But he's unable to sleep due to panic attacks. He cries and writhes in pain constantly. He needs these medications to make his life livable and he keeps refusing. I've never forced him to take the medication, I know he has the right to refuse it but I can't sleep. He cries and yells all night long either from the pain or the anxiety and I am emotionally, physically exhausted.

We are from El Salvador, family of 5 sons, mother and father.

My brothers and I are all between 30 and 40.

My father got diagnosed with prostate cancer 5 years ago, treated him with chemo and got better but being the stubborn man he always was, he never went to his trimester check ups.
5 months ago he began having leg pains so we go to the doc and told us he had bone cancer.
We are all here for him, after all we are five grown sons with 3 grandchildren and 2 on the way. I feel frustrated because I am the only one living in Argentina and is currently on my second visit to El Salvador because of the disease, but we are new with this, everybody is having a hard time emotionally and economically as medicine in El Salvador is expensive and my dad doesn’t have healthcare.

Personally My biggest fear is not sealing my dad healthy again and having to see my mom struggling every day to see that he is without pain, taking care of him, taking care of her students, the money for the meds, the doctors appointments etc.

I am also married with a 3 yo so another fear of mine is that I have people to take care of and ara my priority... but my dad is also a priority...it’s so tough to balance things. Have a lot on my mind every time of the day.

One day at the doc, my mom saw another patient with a more advanced disease and never took this image out of her head of a lady so thin, her face looked like a skeleton. It was so shocking and constantly remembers her and starts to cry because she doesn’t want to see my dad like that.

Today I was seating with my dad and he told me the worst thing to him is feeling useless and not be able to do things. He wonders when he will get better, I don’t know what to say.

Sincerely I don’t know what I turned to reddit for this, I think I just don’t know what else to think, as a family we are losing low on money and all our lives have changed. Not to be selfish, is just that...maybe we were not prepared for this...no one never is prepared I think.

I just came here just to let off steam, because I don’t know where else to talk to people with similar situations. We are all so sad.

We are being strong for him, my mom is being strong for him, we need to be strong together.

Ultimately, I'm not sure how to support boyfriend whose mum is in palliative care for meta lung cancer when he's turning a bit on me

Boyfriend's mum was diagnosed with lung & meta bone cancer in the spring - they put her through chemo as wel as immunotherapy and as of about 1 month ago, the doctors let him and his sister know that she likely had days. She's still hanging on, but it's been very much ups and downs for them, still a constant diagnosis of days, and it's been obviously incredibly tough on him as he tries to navigate this with the rest of his life.

I've been doing what I can for him, as best as I can possibly come up with, and I think it's been helping. We don't live together, but I've basically been living there as the worst of things have happened to give him some company, to help ease the little annoying things (cleaning, sometimes making dinner, giving him massages, buying wine/beer, thinking of things to pick up for his mum that he mentioned,d that sort of thing). He's said it's helped, and I do genuinely believe that, but as he becomes more distant things have been getting tougher - something I expected to happen, but not in this way.

One of the the things we've been doing together that helps take his mind off things is play video games together (hey Skyrim hey). About a week ago, we were playing and he started to get very controlling in a not fun way. I'm usually very patient with him and do not ever get upset with him over things that I don't bring up in a calm way, but this particular instance it felt like he was purposely trying to nag at me and prod the beast that is my patience (later when we chatted, that was indeed the case), so I snapped back at him slightly. We apologized to each other and thought nothing of it, but the same thing happened the other day with a more intense reaction - he thought he was just having fun and didn't realize it came across to me the same as the first time. He got quiet and was clearly very upset, practically giving me the silent treatment for something I thought was fully justified.

Perhaps I should mention at this point that he's been self-medicating with alcohol and weed a lot lately. He normally uses both quite heavily (we share 2 bottles of wine a night on a regular basis), so this should go to show just how much he's been medicating. In addition, he has a problem with controlling his patience, and given everything going on he's at wit's end - I on the other hand am incredibly patient, making this a difficult situation for me to navigate. When I tried to address this second instance of snapping at him, he had already at this point been drinking and using weed (as had I). While we sat and chatted without raising voices, he basically asked if I thought that getting short with him while playing the silly video game ""was really fucking necessary"" and proceeded to talk about how he's going through a lot and that I need to understand he's not always going to be able to rein in the patience, and that he thought I understood this, thought that I would have more empathy, and that he's questioning my empathy now on a larger scale given that a video game is such a tiny thing and ""what might things be like in the real world as time goes on"".

While I understand completely where he's coming from about how much he's going through, I really felt that the comments about my empathy were completely unjustified and told him that I didn't think it was fair to have to just take moments where the frustration are directed at me rather than being allowed to protect myself, to defend myself. He got it, and we apologized, but he also made a comment about how right now he couldn't give two fucks about trying to rein in the patience, that sort of thing. I noted it, but thought no matter, let's move on.

The following day (yesterday) happened to be his birthday. As I left in the morning, things still felt a bit tense and I left feeling icky about the whole thing. The whole day I couldn't help thinking about the comment he made ""attacking"" my empathy, and I made up my mind to let him know that I was feeling that way later in the day, but that I would see things felt with us. Since things were actually quite good, I left it....but didn't want to go to bed with it still on my mind. We went to bed at 230, he had been drinking quite a bit and had had edibles as well, and I didn't realize he was as far gone as he was. I brought up how I was feeling, and he went 0-60 very quickly when he misunderstood my reason for bringing it up was just so he was aware of the fact that I had continued to think about our conversation throughout the day. He yelled at me, saying he doesn't need any more of this shit in his life, that his mother is dying, that I chose to bring this up on his birthday (he has told me multiple times he doesn't even like his birthday), that I was a complete asshole by making something like this about me, and wouldn't really let me explain myself that this was not what I had intended and I simply wanted to be transparent as we've been being throughout the relationship. When I apologized, he further yelled, and said that right now, ""your fucking feelings don't matter, you've just been an asshole throughout this entire thing, you don't matter right now."" We somehow came to a conclusion when he decided to ""give me a chance to right things"" and joined me back in bed (I had been prepared to leave and head home). Before we said goodnight, he said ""my life is my own, and the people I have in it are because I choose to have them there"" or something similar.

When I woke this morning, already I had the impression that he didn't remember - and he didn't. But he knew something was wrong, so asked me about it, at which point I started crying. We spent half an hour talking about what happened the night before because he couldn't remember and insisted, and when I expressed that I would rather leave it as I got the message, asked a few times why I brought it up this morning if I wanted to leave it (even though he had refused to let me go to work until I told him what had happened). When I finally did give an abridged version (as to not invoke his anger accidentally again) he apologized, but again reiterated that he's sensitive right now and that I just have to understand that he felt I was being a dick and that we need to agree to just not be assholes to each other over stupid little things. Not only that, but he said I needed to bring up the shit I'm feeling and tell him - of course exactly what I had tried to do the night before that ended up being a major mistake. I've certainly learned to not have discussions like this while he's not sober, but also I get the impression that even when I do bring things up he's going to get it in his head that it's just me being an asshole and that what I'm feeling or say don't really matter and that he's going to do what he wants without disregard for how I'm feeling that I'm trying to bring up.

I'm at the point where I've been doing everything in my power to support him, but this still isn't enough, and it's now at the point where he's beginning to using me as an outlet for his frustrations. This said, when he is using me as such, and I react as any person likely would and snap back, he vilifies me for ""not understanding his situation and appreciating what he's going through"" and saying things like right now I just have to accept that he just doesn't care about censoring himself right now, rather than understanding he's being unkind to me. I'm genuinely not sure if he knows he's being unkind, but he's blaming me for something he started in the first place and basically saying I'm not allowed to have the feelings I do and respond back because he doesn't need more shit to deal with in his life.

I love the man, and want to support him and will continue to do so, but I'm not sure how to make him see he's taking things out on me without just being told to grin and bear it. I'm an incredibly empathetic person, very patient, and I hate seeing him like this. But I am also someone who's experienced great depression in the past 10 years and only just have been developing confidence (largely thanks to him too) where I have the courage to stand up for things I feel are unjust towards me. All I'm trying to do is protect myself and make sure things don't get to the point where I'm basically being verbally abused. And he doesn't talk much about what's going on with his mum - he'll let me know what happened during the day when he comes home after being at the hospital, but it doesn't feel like he's letting himself be vulnerable around me (he's only cried once).

Does anyone have experience with this kind of reaction of someone who's a cancer patient caregiver?  A lot of what he says about what he's going through and how I need to be sensitive and very careful about that is true, but I really don't agree that I should entirely put aside my feelings and not bring things up if he's cruel to me (whether unbeknownst to him or not). I just don't know what to do, and I don't want this to be the thing that runs our relationship into the ground.",2018-09-27 02:32:24

So about six months ago, me and my best friend were just hanging out, when she told me that she went to the doctor because she had a slight pain in the kidney area and the doctor thinks it might be cancer in an early stage , I don’t remember the specific name, but she told me it’s a rare kind of cancer that is hard to deal with, because of the location of the tumor in the kidney. Long story short, she has four months to live.

Now, for context, at the time we were both 17, and her father was starting to recover from cancer after a lot of chemo.

The worst part of that story was that her family 
Doesn’t know, She wanted to wait until her father was healthy to tell everyone. 
I was a little hesitant about that, but I trusted her to tell them before it’s too late.
She was so afraid of everything that she skipped every test she had and didn’t want chemo.

Fast forward to maybe three or four months ago, She went to enough tests to make sure it was cancer, she had already told a couple more friends, but still not to her family.
I couldn’t just stand there and do nothing while my best friend was dying, From my point of view, her family deserved to know before me, It was really not right to not let them know.
So I was pushing her to tell them, maybe starting to go too far, our relationship started falling apart because of that, we started talking less and when we did talk most of the time it was about that.

Because she skipped almost every test in the beginning, she felt that something wasn’t right, she majored biology in high school so she knew enough to understand what her doctor was saying.
I don’t know enough to fully understand everything she said, but because she skipped most of the tests, there’s still a chance it is not cancer.

And now, two months after the time her doctor gave her, her family still doesn’t know, I still try go get her to talk to them, I’m worried she won’t tell them, they’re her family, they are way more important than me, and they deserve to know, I’m afraid that it would be too late for her to tell them. I know that I’m wrong about pushing her too much, and I’m the one that fucks up our relationship,but I feel like that the most important thing, thats the thing that matters the most .
And again, I feel like I have to at least try to do something.

Her 18th birthday is next week, and she plans to tell them after that.
Our relationship is in a slightly better place now, we had a little fight yesterday, but I feel like we’re in a better place because of that.

I don’t know why I’m posting this, And I don’t know what to expect, but thanks for reading this.

I feel dead on the inside. I haven’t told any friends cause let’s be honest. Nobody cares until something like this happens to you. Honestly what can anyone do other then say “sorry” so the best thing to do is to put a smile on and walk through your day like everything is cool. I can’t blame them though, what am I suppose to do? I can’t fix her. The wife just said to spend time with her but it’s not the same... not at all, every time I look into her sweet eyes I can’t help but to have a rush of emotions hit me. Mom always tells me not to worry everything will be ok and that always breaks my heart. There is always the people who say to pray... I just want to ask them why should I ask for help to the guy who gave this to her... sometimes I honestly feel like that people’s cop out to giving true and honest emotions and words to someone, instead of being there you just say “I will pray for her” what exactly are you asking in your prayer? That the doctor looked at the wrong test result. 

This whole situation has been nothing but a big eye opener on the world, people, God and life. I have this deeper burning feeling inside me to try my hardest to help other people who are going through this family’s, wives, husbands, kids, brothers, sisters, friends and actual victims. I’ve been beating my head against a wall for the last week trying to figure out how I can help people in a way that’s different. Any suggestions would AMAZING! I just want to reach people who are just as frustrated as me and make sure they know they are not alone and I’m on the same road with them and will love to lock hands and be support as we deal with our loved ones terrible disease.

Read and reread all her biopsy reports- i am pretty sure she’s stage 1 or 2 but she’s doing blood work and CT now to confirm.

851,"Six months ago, she had a weird lump in her back. Yesterday, I was told that they’re moving toward hospice.",3,7rq8ec,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/7rq8ec/six_months_ago_she_had_a_weird_lump_in_her_back/,2,1516481780.0,"I will start out by saying this post is not about me, but cancer affects everybody who loves someone with it. It punches you in the heart and then twists it like an ex-lover, but deeper.

My cousin’s wife pointed out a weird lump on her back over the summer. She has been a beloved member of our family for nearly 20 years, and I don’t know if she’ll get to see her 40th birthday, let alone next Tuesday. 

They have 4 kids: ages 16 to 4 years old. Money has always been tight for them, so they waited until they could get her insured to get it checked out. 

She was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, and the family learned about it in August 2017. I learned about it in September. Her father is a chemo doc, so she chose to be treated at his hospital. Nothing has worked, and the cancer has spread. She’s just been deteriorating at a rapid pace. She was already a tiny 110, and is now 72 pounds, maybe less. She needed a massive amount of steroids just to be with the family at Christmas Eve. 

Since the news broke, we’ve all been under strict orders from her immediate family not to post on Facebook about it and not to message her about it. I do have to respect my cousin and his family’s wishes, as well as his wife’s family’s wishes. That’s where it’s so frustrating. I don’t know what to do to help. 

I can’t contact her to just tell her how amazing she has been, raising those 4 kids with a smile on her face and a heart of gold. She’s sleeping for 3 days at a time. I also don’t want to stress her out. 

It’s different when you find out somebody is sick(Get well! See you on Monday!), or somebody is dying(...my predicament), or that somebody is dead(He/she was amazing, even though they won’t be here on this astral plane to hear me tell them!), It’s also quite different given their stages of life or the magnitude of their suffering. 

When you find out a loved one has early-detected cancer, you freak out, take a few deep breaths, and then say “OK. How are we going to fight this?” When you find out a loved one has Stage 4 out of nowhere, You go through a plethora of emotions. Mostly anger, at how cancer doesn’t discriminate between good or bad people. Cancer descended upon a very good person. She deserves so much better! 

You know the feeling you get when you see a missed call from a family member, and you listen to the voicemail, and you can hear the sadness in their voice just saying “Hey, please give me a call back when you get a chance”? I thought “Oh, F**k no. Oh God. She’s gone.” Well, Dad had to be part of the calling tree to tell me that her doctors advised to stop feeding her, and to move her to hospice care. 

She has an appointment with a cancer center for a second opinion on Monday, but we’re all afraid it’s much too late. That doesn’t mean that we aren’t praying for a miracle. I WANT that miracle more than anything in the world. We find out on Monday if there is any bit of hope. 

Optimism and realism are clashing into a sea of prayers and tears amongst our family. Prepare for the worst, and hope for the best.

I want so badly to reach out, to tell her how much all of us love her and care about her; how she’s impacted our lives. I feel like she’s been barricaded from everyone. 

I’m scared, and I’m sad. I can’t imagine WTF she is going through.





UPDATE: It has now been a month since Tonya’s passing. Morgan, now 4, told me that “I miss mommy, but she’s up with the angels and she isn’t hurting anymore.” I had to hold it together and say “That’s right, babygirl.” “I’m NOT a baby!” “Sorry, Morg. You’re right. You’re a big girl.” I spent a lot of time with my family and the kids during the grief process. It’s been very difficult to get back to whatever “normal” was. Now, every time Morgan sees me, she raises her arms up to me and exclaims “You came back home to me!” and she gives me the biggest hug. It melts and breaks my heart at the same time.",2018-01-20 20:56:20

Things have gotten worse and I don't know if the cancer he has is actually beatable like my family originally thought. So far, all we have is speculation courtesy of the doctors keeping their lips tightly shut. All they managed to say was that yes, he has cancer. They haven't said what kind yet (with the exception of one \[not the normal GP my dad sees\] guessing it could be something like bone cancer; some other kind of cancer, etc). They also haven't been helpful when it comes to kicking the oncologist in the ass; since they should've called us already some time ago. We're stuck with a shitty governmental one. We don't really know how to 100% contact this said oncologist (since the GP doc keep the info on the computer). Nobody's offering any help when it comes to treatment, since he hasn't seen an oncologist yet. I feel like by the time the oncologist thinks of us, he'll be fucking dead.

He possibly has more issues than any of us thought. An example of this is the fact his gut actually hasn't disappeared. He's lost 20 pounds (due to not eating) and is actually close to where he should be (ideal weight/height ratio wise). His gut should actually be gone; but his gut is still the same (think beer gut style; without the beer). So he might already have a tumor in his stomach. They're also worried about lung involvement, since he's been having trouble breathing particularly as of late. While his breathing already wasn't good (courtesy of COPD), it's gotten worse. 

I'm admittedly stressed out due to this and a little more sensitive. Everything hurts a little extra. I was already a super sensitive person before this whole thing; now I'm even more super sensitive (which I didn't even know was possible since I thought I was already at max sensitive mode). 

This is a problem, since my dad's in pain. His lower back is essentially obliterated for all intents and purposes (since they saw one vertebrae literally gone; one fractured and a few others that were equally fucked up). So naturally, he's a grouchy, super depressed and angrier since he's been in agony like this for nearly a year. I imagine his anger's originating from the depression (especially since my dad's had shit luck for these past few year and he thinks he's pretty much a dead man walking \[and he may be right or wrong \[it'd help if the oncologist fucking CALLED to confirm or deny that he's a dead man walking\]).

This doesn't help, since I'm already a crybaby by nature. I know he's literally not in his right state of mind (since I imagine he's stressed to the most possible max any human can be \[courtesy of not even knowing if he'll survive or not\] + in agony, since the pain meds seem to only help about 50% of the time). So I try not to take things too personally, but it's nearly impossible for me.   


I still take every little edgy and mean comment he says to heart. I can't help it, as much as I wish I could. It's making me wonder if I should avoid him possibly or not. I don't really want to bring up the fact he hurt my feelings yet again (since it's over something I consider super stupid). But I want to spend as much time with him as possible like I always have. I already know my parents aren't going to be around forever (due to cancer or some other unforeseeable event \[at this rate I'm just waiting for a meteor to hit us all since our luck's been just that shitty for the past few years\]). I want to make as many happy memories with them while I can. But it's hard if I'm constantly feeling hurt by every little mean comment he says.",2020-10-29 07:28:59

My husband and me just found out that my sister in law has breast cancer and started chemo a few weeks ago. 
She seems so strong and she says she is optimistic. She doesn't want to be treated any differently and doesn't want us to be worried about her.  She says ""good vibes only"". 

She is my favorite person of my husband's family and I am crushed because we live in Europe and they live in Canada and I feel so useless. Cancer runs in her family and she has lost a few family members to cancer already so that worries me even more. 
I would love to be able to cook for her or watch her children or anything but obviously I can't from so far away. Due to coronavirus our country is in lockdown again and travelling is also not an option. 

I was wondering if anyone has an idea on how we can still show support from far away? The best thing I could come up with so far was ordering food for them... I don't really know if that's a good idea though. 

Thank you so much, obviously you all have your own things going on as well so I really appreciate you all taking the time to even read my post.

I'm sure everyone here knows cancer is anything but fun, and the months leading to, during and after his surgery were some of the worst in our lives. 

Initially, his toe had to be partially amputated; he recovered well. Then the blood tests came out bad, he needed to get his PET scan done. PET comes back with no organs affected but yes some lymph nodes from his leg, which meant he needed to go to surgery.

About three weeks later (I'm talking july now, after all the tests and back and forth) the surgery takes place. Since it was in another city, I was by myself for +1 month taking care of the pets and the house. 

He came back in August and I'm so thankful and happy to say that he is cancer free, he is taking meds that reduce the chances of it reappearing by 70% and while he is dealing with lymphedema which is quite common, it feels we are mildly out of the woods for the first time since I first heard the words ""cancer"". Althought I imagine you also know with cancer it's never really over.

The reason I'm writing today is because I have been struggling for about 3 months with eating - specifically, I can't eat anything except very soft foods and yogurt. I've lost a lot of weight and I'm seeing doctors about it to rule out a physical condition, but talking to my psychologist I'm starting to wonder if I've been bottling up feelings that manifested into this physical symptom.

I do realize amongst the chaos that was this year - pandemic, cancer AND also moving cities and quitting my job - I might have neglected myself because I needed to act. I didn't really sit down to think or allowed myself to feel because there was so much to be done. I remember that being one of the first things I thought - I need to learn how to drive so I can help. 

When my psychologist brought it up and I think about it, I do feel a whirlwind of emotions bubbling up. I realize that while I have felt overwhelming sadness, I never really took time to cry. I only cried during his surgery because of how scared I was.

What I wanted to ask you all is if you have lived through something similar. Perhaps not with the same physical manifestation, but yes neglecting your feelings because you needed to fight cancer first and everything it destroys. 

Writing about it alone has made me feel a bit better, and I'd love to hear if you have any advice to share from your own experiences. I'm also wishing you the best and sending a tight hug if you're here because a family member or yourself are suffering from cancer.",2020-10-16 07:18:07

I live with my parents and sister, along with my twin girls. I'm a single mom, although my boyfriend is an incredible help when he's here 2-3 times a week. I also work full-time. My job isn't the easiest, and it can be physically draining. Some days I have to take my girls to and from the babysitters' house, but even if I don't, I still struggle to stay on top of everything.

My mom usually ends up having to repeatedly ask me to do certain things. I feel so guilty, because sometimes I do procrastinate (ADD and anxiety are a bitch), but other times it's because I'm so exhausted and have so much pain. It's gotten to the point where, even though I love my job, I might have to find something else less physically taxing. It would break my heart. I love my coworkers, customers, even the work itself. I'm also taking a part-time course for my dream career, which would lead to me being able to take my certification test, which would give me a huge boost up if I pass it. I mention this because my current job is giving me great experience in my desired field, which would make it even harder to give up.

Anyways, all of this is crushing me. I do take medication for ADD, anxiety, and depression. I have BPD as well. So I keep finding myself lashing out at people, even if they weren't meaning anything offensive, because I sometimes misinterpret things or I'm simply at my wit's end. I have to keep it all together, I feel like I don't even have room to properly deal with my grief over my mom's diagnosis, otherwise I really won't be able to do what I need to do. My life has become agonizing, and my mental health is deteriorating. I had to grow up fast, I was already struggling to cope with so many life changes so quickly. I became pregnant with my girls at 21, gave birth without a c-section at 22. Now, I'm almost 24, trying to keep up with two extremely active 17 month olds, while trying to support the rest of my family. 

I'm sorry if this is all over the place, it's been a really hard day, and I've run out of ideas on how to cope. I do have a therapist, but I barely have free time as it is. I've just started to clam up, because I'm tired of hearing ""you just have to be strong"" and ""it'll be okay, you have to stop being so negative."" This is mostly a rant, but I needed to vent in a place where people are more likely to understand my situation and possibly be more empathetic. Would love advice as well, especially on getting through the day, and keeping emotions under control when they need to be.

Edit: TLDR; My mom has Stage IV appendix/renal cancer, and I'm a single mom with various health struggles that's hardly able to do the bare minimum at home.

Edit #2: For anyone that saw my post about my mom getting a CT scan done, they found that her tumors have been diminishing, and she'll be going to a hospital a few hours away to be evaluated for surgery in the near future. However, her red blood cell counts are now down.",2020-10-08 02:29:28

My mom was just diagnosed with Stage 4 Breast last week, after ignoring a lump for 3 f*cking years. Both my dad and her have been in denial about the growth for a longggg time, and the only way I could get actually get her to go to the Doctors was by threatening to call 911 and have her escorted there. I was about the burn house down.

Anyways... after a few days of some serious grieving and the typical wave of emotions one goes through when they come to terms with the finiteness of the humans they love—I’m coping by researching, I think in a healthy way? I’m researching success stories, diet and nutrition, ways we can now treat it and prevent it from getting worse. I want to SAVE my mom, and I have hope we CAN at least make this easier through the power of knowledge and positive outlook!!! No matter what happens!!!!!

However, I’m the only one in my family who is coming at it like this. My little brother, mom and dad are ALL acting like this is an automatic death sentence, and she’s already dead. I’m trying not to let it anger me, I just desperately want to convince them otherwise and get my mom on a healthier diet, have the house inspected for mold, get a water filter... nothing too extravagant, I don’t think??? 

Problem is, I know I can’t help my mom alone. It has to be a team effort, and ultimately has to be her decision... and I think she’s coming around. But my dad has been awful to me. He can’t stand hearing my positivity, my suggestions, or the resources I’m trying to show them. I know he’s stressed and scared and just angry with himself for letting it go for years and is displacing it all and pointing fingers at me... But it’s been horrible. I’ve only ever known him as a kind, loving and supportive father towards me and today we talked on the phone after going over some mold inspections plans (which he doesn’t want to do) and told me I “would be a terrible doctor” (a life aspiration of mine) and that I have been “the source of all his stress in this.” It cut me like a knife, because that’s the opposite of what I’ve been trying to do for everyone.

I hardly EVER feel anger... but right now I just feel like I’ll never be able to look at my dad the same, if I’ll even be able to look at him at all. 

I guess right now I’m just asking for some encouragement, BECAUSE THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST THING IVE EVER EXPERIENCED AND I WOULDN’T WISH THIS ON MY WORST ENEMY. I’m desperate to hear from someone who can relate, or just get some kind of resource that can help me navigate all of this, because obviously it’s not going to be my mom or dad this time.

At that time we didn't know the stage or prognosis it was scary not knowing. It was an emotional rollercoaster to say the least. Then several weeks later after a CT scan, we were told it was  stage 2/3 adenocarcinoma because it had been found in two of his nearby lymph nodes. I thought okay that's not so bad. The team of doctors said 5 days of radiation and then chemo once a week until surgery. Well then another week goes by my dad has his endoscopic ultrasound to see the tumor depth. They find the tumor has grown through into outer muscle of his esophagus. 

 Two weeks ago on my birthday I get a text with results from my dad's ultrasound, my  mom says his cancer has been restaged to a 4! WTF?!  This time I am balling my eyes out. My dad's team of doctors adjust his treatment plan accordingly, 28 days of radiation plus one day of chemo per week for three hours. Then 6 weeks of rest and surgery in December. My dad goes to an appointment to talk about the surgery with his thoracic surgeon, he gets another bomb shell,  they are going to completely remove his esophagus and move his stomach up to basically take it's place. Two weeks in the hospital. He is already having difficulty swallowing and is eating less as a result. My mom has already modified his diet to fit with his eating issues and his loosing his will to eat because it is difficult for him. He cannot loose a drastic amount of weight. His doctors need him to eat to keep up his strength to make it through chemo and radiation.

 Today he started his treatment. I honestly wish they had started it weeks ago. I am scared he will not want to keep fighting especially when the chemo and radiation side effects kick in. They say everyone is different in how their bodies handle it. I pray my dad is strong enough and stubborn enough to push through the difficult days that will come.  I am grateful that my dad has a huge amount of support from his family. My aunt came to stay with mom to help her out when my dad starts to get sick from his treatments.

I'm constantly on egde that he's going to pass away. My anxiety about it is fine when he's awake as I can visibly see if he's OK or not. But when he's asleep I get anxious he's going to just pass away in his sleep and I won't notice. Anyone else going through something similar? Any advice?,2020-09-11 18:33:51

First time posting here.
I'm 24 years old, and I discovered 3 years ago my grandfather had cancer. He went through the chemo treatments and for a while he was cancer free. The cancer in particular is Folliculer Lymphoma. He's quiet about it, but what I do know is that it's in his hair follicles on his head. 
Just this year it came back. So tomorrow he is being admitted to the hospital for 2 months to go  through stem cell removal, then strong chemo. And then those stem cells put back and more strong chemo. It's a 99.5% success rate. But I have anxiety, and all I think about is that .5% and it's tough. I know I have so many positives placed before me but all I see are the negatives.
I'm honestly not sure if I'm looking for advice or just need to get this off my chest. But this really is a breath of fresh air. The months to come will be difficult but I can only hope they are successful.
Much love and support to you all!",2020-09-09 15:16:14

I wrote a post about it before too. At that time, it was Stage 2B and now it is Stage 3. 

The past 2 months of my life have been the toughest I have ever had to go through. From knowing that it is Stage 1B and favorable condition, in 2 months time it has gone to Stage 3. I have never been this scared of losing someone in my entire life. I don’t know how to deal with these feelings and how to be there for him.

On top of all of that, I’m a budding pastry chef in making. My academy has been closed for the past 6 months due to coronavirus and it might soon reopen. But I do not have the focus or the attention needed to learn. On one hand I know it would provide me with good distraction but on the other hand, I jist have breakdowns in the middle of my day and my anxiety is at an all time high. 

For the past 2 months, I did not have to worry about the academy or anything bit I could just focus on my boyfriend, since no one else knows what he’s going through and I can’t be there with him in the hospital because of coronavirus. But now, the very thought of going back to school terrifies my every fiber of being. I don’t know how to do it again. All of this also includes the fear of bringing back the virus at my house, where my dad is 60 years old and my brother has asthma. And I know for a fact that I definitely won’t be able to meet my boyfriend for a long time once I start going to the academy. I have roughly 4-6 weeks of classes left.

On to my post. My mom was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer in January. It has been a whirlwind since. Between hospital stays, finding other issues and covid, 2020 has been a great year. But the reasoning for my post. 

My parents and I have a strained relationship. My Dad worked nights my entire childhood and wasn’t around for a lot of life lessons. My Mom did everything right, but was never the type to accept the faults she had. When she was diagnosed, I was not told officially until two weeks after her initial diagnosis. Even though I already knew from hearing from the doctors and being able to put 2 and 2 together. I.e the floor she was on in the hospital. Who her doctor was and what their specialty was. Gotta love the internet. My family for whatever reason does not share info real well. Both of my parents want to keep everything close to chest. Which I totally understand wanting to keep things private but neither one of them have a real strong support group to lean on. Believe me, I’ve tried. Two weeks ago, I believe Mom had a stroke. The last few visits, she’s barely acknowledged me and my daughter being there and is pretty much nonverbal. She’s able to say a yes/no but that’s about it. Since all this began in January, I’ve been locked out from meetings with doctors, I haven’t been able to take her to treatments or just been able to be there. I call and text almost daily. And I get very little back. I just want to know how my mother is doing. I know my time with her is limited. I just hate the feeling of being left out.",2020-08-26 08:28:24

So this past week my (22F) mom (54) found out she has Stage 2 cervical cancer. She told me she might need a major operation and that she's looking for a doctor with my step-dad (67). She hopes to have the operation ASAP.

I guess I just don't really know how to react. I understand my mom feels stressed right now, considering there's a pandemic and all. She's also scared I think. I don't know. I don't have the closest relationship with my mom, so we don't normally open up to each other at all. I don't want to ask her much because I don't want to add to her stress, and also because she tends to take out her frustrations on people sometimes. 

I know I should probably be there for her but I just don't know how to be. My mom raised me on her own. As much as I understand now that she couldn't be there for me much growing up because she had to work to support me and my older brother, I haven't let go of my resentment towards her. I know she did her best, and it's not like she was absent, but when I felt like I needed my mom as a ""friend"", she was never there.

My dad, who I know did nothing to financially support me or my brother, became the ""friend"" parent I was looking for growing up. Although I also don't have a very close relationship with my dad, he is someone I would go to when I decide to open up to a parent and look for advice.

I guess I've been walking on eggshells around my mom for years now, and my mom has told me as well that she feels the same. Even knowing this, we can't seem to get close, and I find it difficult to open up and be honest with my mom.

Right now, I just feel really awkward, and I don't know what to do. Should I ask how she's feeling? Should I try to help out? She actually asked me to be in charge of meal planning for me and my step-dad because after the operation I know she won't be able to move around the house much. I just said okay, but to be honest, I thought of maybe just staying with my dad for a while by then so I'm not around the house so she doesn't need to think about me. But that thought seems wrong, like maybe I should be here with her but I just don't know how to. Again, I just feel awkward

This pandemic hasn't helped me much mentally as well, but I don't want to get into too much detail about how I feel about my personal future. I just want to try and be there for my mom but I don't know how.",2020-08-26 01:40:07

This is probably going to be all over the place but it makes me feel better to hope that someone feels like reading all this. I apologize also if the punctuation and/or grammar isn’t on par.

My dad (66) and I (21 F) have never had the most ideal relationship. He suffered significant emotional, physical, and mental abuse from his parents his entire life and despite being nothing like him towards us, his temper and abusive words and tendencies have created tension and issues between us for years now to the point where I don’t really have conversations with him unless we both happen to be home or I need money for something (unfortunately). I can only imagine what he had to deal with during his child-adulthood living with them when he had because he still has very much open wounds from the treatment. He’s very stuck in his own ways and has a very “my way of the highway” attitude about literally anything. He’s been verbally and physically abusive towards my siblings and mom to the point where the cops have had to be called several times in the past, is extremely sensitive, and doesn’t like any kind of disrespect whether it’s intentional or not. In short, my relationship has been quite strained with him and my siblings and I generally rely on our mom for every other parental support. With all of that being said though, I wouldn’t trade him for anyone in the world. He’s extremely smart and was a very successful physician in his earlier years. Ironically though he has a very large distaste for the healthcare world as a whole. 

He was diagnosed with colon cancer in June of 2018 but unbeknownst to all of us, he’d actually had the tumor for well over 2 years before he bothered look further into what was going on. Up until May of 2020, other than counting for the days where he’d spend the days sleeping off his chemo and radiation treatments, he was fine. To us at least. He’d still run errands, drive himself around, handle all of the big bills in the house, he was working...And then he had the surgery. 

Almost immediately (the evening he got out of the surgery) it was clear my dad wasn’t prepared for the realistic recovery time from this operation. He’d never been operated on before and this was a 6 hour surgery to have a temporary Colostomy bag placed on him that we’d hoped would be removed in another 3 months after the surgery, things didn’t go as planned though. He was only supposed to be in the hospital for 4 days tops but he ended up being there 3 weeks, this is early June now because his surgery was on the 11th of May. When he finally came home the weight loss was very hard to miss. He’d gone from 185 lbs to what looked like 160, and my dads 5’10 so it was eerily noticeable. He only continued losing the weight after the fact.

Fast forward to July, he still hasn’t walked, is barely eating or even drinking, and my mom has become his primary care taker; feeding him, bathing him, sleeping on the couch to not have to disturb him but to still be able to hear him if he needs water or something, just everything. He’s now closer to 140 lbs and slowly losing more and more mobility and energy with every day he decides not to eat. He’s throwing up bile and blood, getting mini looking seizures, and had developed diabetes but hadn’t been taking his meds. He’d slipped into a full on depression and had pretty much given up on himself (he’s always struggled with on and off depression) while also refusing to get medical care. At this point it’s hard even coming upstairs to say hi or ask if he needs anything because the person I’m seeing and attempting to talk to looks nothing like the man that has watched me grow up.. he finally agreed to being taken to the hospital though on the 14th and since then there’s been slight improvements but not much. 

I went to see him in the hospital the 16th and the entire time all I could do was get him water when he asked, answer his random questions or statements that’d often have nothing to do with what was going on, and cry silently as I watched him writhe in pain and shake as he tried drinking his own water. It was only when I was about to leave when he looked at me, smiled, and told me how beautiful I’d grown up to be. I’m crying as I type this now because that’s probably the first and only time I’ll ever hear him say that... It hurts seeing him in pain and knowing there’s nothing I can do to reverse time and take away this fucking disease, it hurts feeling like I’m probably going to walk down the aisle without him when I’m married, it hurts envisioning his absence at my graduation, it hurts knowing he probably won’t be able to be repaid for all he’s done for me and taught me... I can’t even think about how my mom has been able to handle everything. The last update I heard his BP is low enough for him to slip into hypertension and possibly a coma and that his tumor has now metastasized to his liver. I’m terrified of losing my dad... I can’t deal with this pain.",2020-08-19 17:19:40

My mother was diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer in May and is now undergoing her 5th round of chemotherapy and taking it like a champ! 

First off, I don’t want to brag, but she hasn’t lost any weight and is going to work every week between treatments which is absolutely astonishing. Those little victories don’t mean much to others, and sometimes they don’t mean much to her, but they give me hope and almost make me cry out of joy at the end of the day. 

As many of you likely know, chemo’s a bitch. 
We’ve been able to handle most side effects pretty well, and the nausea hasn’t even been terrible. The cold sensitivity, however, is in full swing. 

We opted for the Folfirinox protocol, which involves a 5-hour infusion at the clinic, plus a 46-hour infusion with a pump we can take home. 

She says anytime she touches cold things, that she feels a jolt of electricity, like sticking your finger in a socket. Usually this goes away a day or two after finishing the infusion, but has been much more severe this time around. She can’t use silverware, or open the fridge on her own because it hurts so much. 

So here I ask for your help. Has anyone had any experience with cold sensitivity? Any recommendations or tips on how to handle it? We bought thin cotton gloves for her to wear around the house but I can see some things will get harder (like flushing the toilet!). Any help and tips are appreciated!

She had surgery and went through several rounds of chemo, and for a while things were looking positive.

She had cancerous cells that the surgeon wasn’t able to remove, and her oncologist hoped they could treat it with chemo — but her latest round isn’t working, and her tumour markers are really high.

The statistics say the survival rate for ovarian cancer is about five years, but it really felt like my mom was going to be the one to defy odds. My parents called me today to tell me unfortunately, that won’t be the case.

We don’t yet know how long she has. I am completely crushed.

When she was first diagnosed, I thought about my mom not living to see me get married and have children. As her treatment went on, I felt like that would no longer be the case — that she was going to beat this.

I don’t know what to do myself. I know I should feel lucky that I will get to say goodbye, but right now I just feel angry and sad.

I also live about a 10-hour drive away and haven’t been able to see her in months because of the pandemic, so I’m feeling extremely guilty that I have missed so much time with her.

i bring her to chemo appointments. set up everything. insurance. doctors. lawyers. driving. groceries. etc...so i feel exhausted. i havent left my bed in maybe 3 days very much. depression is rubbing off on each other.

tips appreciated.  ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. she just told me to get out of the house if i keep acting like this (depressed), that she doesnt want me here, i guess out of kindness and upset-ness. that shell just take care of herself. that she will kick me out. i mean its important for her not to get upset, as it flares her pain, but she gets upset rather easily. i try to just follow her rules. but its so many rules. lol. our language barrier brings frustrations too. so even communicating can be stressful. there are no other caregivers. i have no where to go except my dad's. my mom gets lonely and depressed if left by herself too long. she cant handle appointments and doesnt even drive at this point because it has always stressed her out. i cant just leave her. it just doesnt make sense.

i get the sense that her issues w anger probably caused her cancer, to some extent...actually it makes a lot of sense...maybe. if her flare ups caused gastro-intestinal issues, and it happened often, it could have been the start of chronic infection related to gallbladder cancer...

feels really sad:(...................................

just need to figure out how to have self-care time while living in close quarters...i dont want to take emotional beatings, not say anything, and feel resentful, have anger bubble up. at the same time, dont want to piss her off too much by addressing it either without ability to just let it go myself. lol. seems kinda hard to do neither.",2020-07-24 08:47:33

My mom was just diagnosed with stage 4 cancer 2 or 3 weeks ago, most likely endometrial. It has spread to her liver and spine and there is no treatment she qualifies for. The doctor told us she most likely has 3 or less months to live - I read that usually these prognosis’ are overestimated and now I can’t cope. We didn’t have a perfect relationship and I used to fight with her more times than I can count. I was always very irritated with her for some reason, especially when she became ill. I was angry that I had to pause my life and I was angry that no one else in my family (my father and only sibling) wouldn’t help. The rest of our family lives in a different country so I was alone for months until I finally took her to the hospital and she was diagnosed. I am full of guilt because of my carelessness and ignorance - if I had taken her to the hospital earlier she might have gotten treatment. It’s been 3 weeks since she’s been at the hospital and due to COVID, only I am allowed in because I can translate for her and can communicate her symptoms best. This means I have to break everything to my father and sister, including her 3 months prognosis which happened today. Because there is no treatment option, she is getting discharged this week, meaning these past 3 weeks at the hospital were nothing but a waste of time and rather worse for her mental and physical health. We are scheduled to see another doctor at a different hospital next week for a second opinion but I’m tired of getting my hopes up and being let down. My mom is only 55 and she had so much she wanted to do. She was such an active woman who valued our family so much, even if she showed it in unique ways. I can only now tell how much she’s done for us and can’t keep myself together. I keep thinking about 3 months from now, and wonder if she’ll make it for her birthday like she wanted. A part of her somehow knew she wouldn’t make it and she has actually said 3 months herself before the doctor said anything. She keeps saying she wants to make it for her birthday which is in 3.5 months and this has stuck with me so much. I feel like I’m dying everyday and I hate seeing her in so much pain.

I'm 24. Graduated from college Dec 2019 and a bit directionless. I wanted to drift and find my way traveling and meeting people while seeing what life had in store for me as I formed a path of my own; I already was doing a bit of this in practice but never formally left my hometown or my parents and was in the process when corona hit and I quarantined with mom. She was suddenly diagnosed early last month with stage 4 gallbladder cancer. I am here with her as her primary caretaker now and there is little else family who would properly step in. So, I see myself here for the foreseeable future. There does not seem to be the option of a nursing home. She does not currently qualify for disability aid, as her work credits don't qualify her.

I am fine with being her caretaker, though should the end of her life be near, I am afraid, too, about witnessing her pain by myself and caring for myself emotionally. There is family, but I don't feel comfortably dependent on them enough to really reach out or be received emotionally...we aren't that close is all.

Anyway,

as it is with cancer, we just don't know what the heck a timeline is! I know the percentages. I've looked at them. We have not been given a timeline. The doctor said, in an optimistic tone, ""You may even have a year!"" Lol. Somewhat, this is longer than I had anticipated, and took with gratitude. But a year isn't promised. I understand she may even be alive for longer.

I just don't quite understand how to plan and live my life as an adult, while I am caring for her at this stage. I feel like she will be the center of my life, this cancer will be, maybe? you know? I don't know how soon it will come or how much further in the future it will be either...I am directionless, careerless, relationship-less (save for a few wonderful friends who are long-distance).

I want to start to pave a direction--but even that seems strange and out of place? I can compartmentalize the space of time to begin my own journey, while assisting her and caring for her--but starting grad school or taking classes at a time like this seems strange, too. Doing most anything seems strange independent from the situation.

I'm not making any money! It's not necessarily a big issue for us, right now...but I feel I'd like to be on my own two feet, somewhat, before she leaves me...so i can get a feel for it? know that i can do it? you know? i will receive an inheritance, and there shouldn't be too much worry...but...i want to grow into my own...know that i am solid. that i am well enough to feel the weight of the world when she goes, or whatever it is.

I have thought about writing a few articles to post and begin a writing portfolio, though. :) There is enough quiet time for that!

But, again, it seems like many things ""should"" be on hold? Or I don't quite know how to work in my life and our life together...when I am in a transitional state entering adulthood (I was a very timid one:)) and quite isolated. and experiencing waves of grief, and anticipate i will likely go through heavier grief later down the road. Dunno. i dunno. dunno!. dunno!

What do you all think? How have you navigated this? Anything you might have to say is greatly appreciated for your time and effort to support me:)

I keep thinking about someone I had a relationship with I greatly admire...dreams and all...

have to prepare a will, today, i think...the lawyer will call at 2 for any remaining questions:

what should i have prepared?

is a will all that's needed?",2020-07-21 23:10:31

She's currently in hospital to remove a tumour on arm and recovering from that, but she will require surgery ASAP to remove her kidney. We're still waiting to find out if the tumour on her arm is benign or malignant.

My mum said she doesn't want to go through chemo, and I will support her in any decision she makes. The thing I'm most worried about is her suffering.

It was an overwhelming three weeks and we were trying to figure out if we could make us work again. Then all this happened with his dad. I figured talks of us wouldn't be a priority for a while which is obviously fine and understandable. I just want to be there for him and his family and support him however I can. His family doesn't know that we've been talking though. A few days ago he told me he can't get attached to me. I asked if he wanted me out of his life and he said yes but I could call him every few days to check on him. I'm more than happy to do that because I do love him and want to give him whatever support I can. 

I just feel so alone. It may seem selfish but when we were together his dad was like a dad to me. I'm so sad about this diagnosis. Already I was on the outside, unable to do anything to help because his parents didn't know I was kind of back in his life. But now, even more so, I'm on the outside. I can't even talk to him daily. I have no one to grieve with. I'm not even part of the situation. I'm at a complete loss of how to cope and deal with this. I really want to be with him and go through this situation with him. I'm also hurt that he doesn't want me in his life to help deal with everything. I know that's less important considering the gravity of his dad's cancer, but it's just so confusing. Why wouldn't someone want love and support? Even if it is from an ex? We both love each other. There are just complications surrounding our relationship. So why would he push me away? 

I feel very selfish feeling all of this. But I also feel like I have no one to talk to and I don't know how to deal with this.

So as it says^

My Mum is receiving hospice inpatient care now for her cancer. Devastated beyond belief doesn’t cover it. We had our little girl in Jan- first grandchild (so we could have as much time with her and my baby) and covid ruined it all.

Now she’s in hospice. She’s 59 and will be leaving my youngest sister (18) and me and my other sister behind. I’m the eldest and responsible as NOK, executor, house, funeral everything and I’m petrified of it all. I’m organised and mentally I’ve prepared but I feel like I have anticipatory grief. I can’t be sad as I’m the mature one who will handle it all.

Anyway that in mind our young sister is 18 and has never had a dad.
It’s never mentioned, never questioned. There is 0 other family either.

I want to ask my Mum about her father but how?
I’m scared ill traumatise her or something as it’s never ever mentioned ever.

But... when my sister asks one day she can’t ask anyone can she?

I’ve searched the memory boxes (I had to finish putting them together :( ) and the will and wishes etc. Everywhere a letter could be.

So I’m asking: has anyone had to do this? When should I? We can visit now and keep distance but we live 3 hours away so visiting is weekly with our little one. 

Could I ask a counsellor at the hospice to speak to her?
I think I want it in writing so I can keep it and if my sister asks, she has that.

I sort of don’t want to know if it’s bad?

Any advice would be so appreciated x",2020-07-05 05:53:15

An elderly relative had been diagnosed as stage 3 laryngeal cancer. After further biopsies and investigations it’s actually spread into the oesophagus. So now we are at stage 4. 

Due to previous medical history, their age and how quickly it is advancing- surgery is not an option. 

An MDT meeting is being held on Monday to determine the next course of action; curative radiotherapy or palliative radiotherapy. At this stage the width of the tumour has increased by double the size in 3 weeks. Radiotherapy of either kind wont be starting until around 3-4 weeks after Monday. 

If it’s growing and spreading rapidly, is this not too long to wait? 

Also, he is currently in hospital for a few more examinations and to try to get his pain controlled but he will be getting discharged home on Monday. I’ve asked about a social work referral or something to get some assistance at home, not in the form of carers but rather aids to make life easier (bathroom is down stairs, bedrooms are up stairs, there is only a bath in the house which he struggles to get in/out of etc) but this won’t be arranged until after he gets discharged.

I'm new to all this so forgive me if I'm not as articulate as need be. In September my mother \[63\] was diagnosed with Cancer of Unknown Primary after doctors found cancer in her liver. HOWEVER they are fairly sure the primary cancer was from a lung tumor she had removed 30 + years ago and had been slowly growing in her liver for that long. So, it's technically CUP it seems, but they know where the primary was, I think. 

My mother doesn't like to talk much about it because I think she's trying to protect me. She doesn't want me online Googling all her treatments and her symptoms, so she often wont tell me the names of the drugs she's on. She just finished 8 mos of chemo which apparently is very targeted bc she hasn't lost her hair and her immune system is hanging in there. 

HOWEVER when I called home last week my father and her told me there was good news! All of the tumors in her bones had gone away except for one, which she would have radiation for. Excellent news, except I was never told she had tumors in her bones. I had no idea. I didn't say anything and was happy for her and continued the phone call as if nothing was wrong, but I was completely blindsided. They made no mention of the fact they hadn't told me.

I'm so glad there was some good news regarding her cancer, but the fact that I'm not told everything makes me feel like there's something terrible they are not telling me. All I've been told is that her cancer is a pretty unique situation, that the tumors in her liver are very very slow growing, and that overall it seems like it's not in panic mode yet. 

I wish I was allowed to be in on all the information, so I knew what my mother is facing. I also know that things change and things get worse, and I don't trust that they would tell me that either. I don't know what to do. My mother is a headstrong woman who doesn't like to be out of control, or treated like as sick person, so I'm sure this is her way of dealing with that. I also know that this isn't my sickness, it's hers, and she's allowed to handle it as she likes. I just love her and want to support. Is there anything I can do? I'm feeling frustrated and scared. Ugh. Thank you if you've read this whole thing.

TL;DR: My mother won't tell me the whole picture when it comes to her cancer.",2020-06-12 10:45:48

The good: My dad successfully beat bladder cancer :D! Diagnosed in the fall, chemo in the winter, bladder removed in the spring, fully recovered from surgery and no signs of cancer anywhere else. 

The worrying: Talking to him, I worry that he has turned this victory into a defeat. There is a 50% chance of the cancer recurring somewhere else in the next five years, and with nothing else to do in the time of Covid it seems like he is in a period of deep rumination on his own mortality, talking about how he doesn't think he'd want to go through all that a second time. I'm totally accepting of people's right to things like a DNR and not to suffer unnecessarily, but I worry that there is nothing he seems to want to live for, nothing pulling him to life and not much to look forward to besides decades of slow, potentially painful aging. 

He was also on opiates recovering from the surgery, and has been cutting back (withdrawal irritation?). Now mostly tylenol at safe dosages and CBD for sleep.

My parents are retired in their 60s, don't have many friends, and the things that brought him joy (swimming, volunteering) are currently off-limits. Hopefully that changes sooner than later. My sister lives across the country, and I live across an ocean so it's not possible for us to see him more than a few times a year, but I have been stepping up with more phone calls, sharing photos, getting them little gifts etc.

I just wanted to share a wonderful experience I had while watching a TV show.

To preface. My mother was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer exactly a year ago.  We have for the most part been well and adapting to this new life.  But we have struggled with communicating with each other our deep feelings about the situation and what will come.  Mainly facing what life means without each other.  
I was watching a show on Netflix titled ""The Midnight Gospel."" and found an episode that I think really helped myself, my mother and anyone else currently struggling with this. For those who are unaware it is an adult animated series adapting real interviews from a podcast hosted by Duncan Trussell. 
Duncans mother passed away from cancer and before she passed he had a long in depth interview with her. And his interview with her was adapted into Episode 8 ""Mouse of Silver.""
It was really beautiful.  So I shared it with my mother.  And while it is not something my mother would normally watch, she did and since then we have had better communication and it has put in her a place of ease. 
I want to encourage others to watch this episode (or all the episodes!) and maybe share it with loved ones.  If the animated effects are too much, then just listening is enough. 

I'd also like to ask if there are any other forms of media people have found that have touched them and helped them through all this.  Books, movies, shows, articles. Please I'd love to hear.",2020-05-19 04:59:42

I’ll preface this by saying I’m extremely new to this sub and am sorry if this isn’t the appropriate community. I’m reaching out to see if anyone else feels how I do and what has helped them move forward/address these emotions. 

One of my parents was diagnosed with melanoma last year, and after an extremely aggressive treatment and surgery all scans have been clear and all follow up has been positive. I regularly see a dermatologist and have had more biopsies than I can count on both hands and I’m barely old enough to legally drink. I’ve always known in the back of my head that I need to be vigilant as my family has been ravaged by cancer, but during my most recent biopsy the PA just flat out told me that my risk of developing melanoma is between 50-70% percent. 

I’ve always been vigilant about caring for my skin, even before diagnosis, and I’m not a “sun worshiper” but I’m having a tough time dealing with my friends and family who continue to tan. People who sat next to me while I cried over the dinner table, worried about my family member, post all over social media in their bikinis and slathered in oil and actively comment on how fair I am.

I’m just so frustrated at the inability of some people to connect and act like a human. It makes me feel like all the worry and stress and tears my family went through didn’t make any impact on anyone. This is something that affected my family and me for the rest of our lives and I guess I’m just having a hard time adjusting while everyone else proceeds as normal.",2020-05-17 04:36:59

In the beginning I honestly never expected her to live this long, and I’m grateful. But ever since her diagnosis I began to shut down entirely, I can’t help but feel like I’ve wasted the time left with her and haven’t done enough for her,It kills me.  

I want to do more for my mother, I want to give her everything. But everyday is a struggle. My dad is gone for 1 month at a time so every other month I’m her primary caretaker and its been so hard for me. I used to leave school way early so I could be home for her. Everyday is a constant internal battle with hating myself, feeling worthless, seeing no reason to keep living, feeling like a horrible daughter for not doing my part.  I just DONT KNOW why my dad would leave mom with me without another helping hand at home, especially when he knows I’m depressed to the point where i can’t move, I’ve also recently become partially immobile because I broke my fuckinf tailbone, making me even more bedridden then I was before. 

 Ive tried to do as much as I can, but I feel like I’m glued to my bed. Ever since I was in 5th grade I’ve dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts, so when she was diagnosed I slipped into the worst depression I’ve ever felt. I’ve tried to commit suicide several times within the past few months. and recently I watched  her nearly die in front of me because I accidentally napped too long and her blood sugar was so low (she’s type 2 diabetic). She said this was the worst her sugar has ever been. I can’t help but blame myself. She couldn’t hear me or speak to me, she was in a vegetable-like state, I fed her by hand and just kept holding her hand and rubbing it and saying I loved her, I thought it was my last time with her. and she started crying hard, and I asked why she was crying and she kept saying because my hand felt good in her hand. I stayed strong and didn’t cry, i haven’t shown any hurt in front of her over her poor health, I keep all my tears behind closed doors. she lived that night, but it still scares me to think about it, it scares me so much everytime her blood sugar gets low, everyday is scary for me

I want to learn more about her. I have a little bit, but not as much as I’d like to. I don’t even know her families names nor have I seen their faces in pictures. I haven’t met ANYONE from her family. Not her mother, father, brother, sister, niece, no one. Lately when I ask her more than 1 simple question like ‘what’s your favorite food’ she just says she doesn’t care to answer. It’s not like she has no energy and can’t talk, she talks a lot, she just doesn’t like questions lately. I’ve at least recorded several conversations with her in the past several months, but I still feel like I know her only on the surface level. We have a communication barrier because she speaks broken English, and I never got to learn her native tongue. I just feel like I’m stuck and like I’ll never move from here, I don’t treat every day like it’s her last day alive, I just feel horrible, so horrible that I’ve just stopped living, I’m just existing now. 

I can’t take care of myself or my school work. I began to not do classwork when the school year started, I’ve been a 4.0 GPA student all my HS career but now I’m at a 1.5. I’m failing 2 college courses and haven’t turned in a single thing for 2 other classes, meaning I have a total of 0% in them. I’ve just given up on every aspect of my life. I’m turning down an $18k scholarship, i probably won’t go to college this year, maybe not ever. I just don’t care. I didn’t expect to be alive at this point so I have no future planned. 

I have coped by mainly by sleeping up to 17 hrs a day, becoming a recluse and laying in bed withdrawing from everyday life and socialization as much as I can, overeating all the time and gaining 20 pounds in 6 months (I hate my body now lol) and drowning my sorrows in drugs and trivial things like television. Call me lazy or a horrible person or whatever but if you’ve had depression you’d know that it makes even brushing your hair or getting out of bed seem like running a marathon.

At her funeral my mum was in a significant amount of pain, but my mum being as stubborn as a mule, it took almost everyone in attendance to tell her to go to the doctor's.

Fast forward to new years eve and mum has been to the doctor's and he wanted her to be admitted to hospital immediately that day as he was concerned about her renal function.  So she goes to the hospital and they run all relevant tests and discover a mass on her ovaries, and she has started to get a large build up of fluid in her abdomen.  She remained in hospital for about 2 weeks so they could drain the fluids and keep an eye on her kidney function.

After her stay in hospital she returned home, but was very weak and remained in bed most of the time.  It's now 30th January and we go to an appointment with the oncologist to find out where we are with the discovery.
During the appointment mum was in extreme amounts of pain so the appointment had to be cut short because the oncologist wanted her back in the hospital, but before she went back he did disclose to me and my dad that it was aggressive but didn't say much more than that.

So we get her back the hospital (which for me was the most difficult ambulance journey of my life, not only did I fear for my mum's life but never did I think that I would have to use training in restraint on my own mum) and she is pretty whacked out from the oramorph, and after more tests we are told she would need to go to CDU to get an infection under control in her kidneys.  Before she went down a doctor there took me, my dad, my brother and my sister to a separate room and told us that the cancer is stage 4, and that the mass is obstructing her kidneys not allowing them to function properly (worst moment of my life)

So after a couple of days in CDU she is taken back to the ward so we can start preparing for any imminent treatment that she would need in the small hope that she can beat this.  But over the next 24 days I had to watch my mum slowly either away and die and she succumbed to her cancer on the 23rd February 2020, truly the most difficult day of my life and I just don't know how to process this.  My friends, family and even work have all been nothing but amazing during all of this, but even with that support I just don't know to process the fact that I'll never speak to her again, or hear her laugh again, or have my son grow up knowing just how awesome she was, I know I can tell him about her as he grows but it's just not the same is it?  That is the hardest thing for me, knowing he won't have her in his life as he grows up.

If you took the time to read this I really do thank you, I find it extremely difficult to express how I'm feeling to people who can't see how I'm feeling, so if any of this didn't make sense I apologise

We’ve barely left her side for days since she deteriorated so fast. Stage 4 melanoma, lungs and brain. Brain is full of these aggressive, massive tumors. They found thirty of them just a couple months ago, and since our first immunotherapy some have doubled or tripled in size. There’s just no room for her brain up there. 

That’s the most frustrating part. She’s so healthy. She’s active, strong heart, muscles, etc. If I could just get those tumors out of her brain, she’d be fine...except that we haven’t been able to get any food and barely any water in her for three days. 

It’s been both touching and devastating having friends and family come by or call to say their last words and pay respects. Most share wonderful stories, but a few lecture me about what else we should try, and to not give up because she’s a fighter. 

Those sentiments tear me apart. But even without them, I can’t stop thinking that I should have done more, that I could have done more sooner to help her beat this. Because now it’s too late and we just have to sit by her, administering comfort care, while her otherwise healthy body eats itself to death. 

I’m the oldest child, I’m the one that’s been here since that first appointment. I should have pushed her to get one more surgery, or I should have gotten her out of the house more early on when she started getting lethargic, or I should have told her more how much I need her to live and be here with me, 

For the last two weeks before she lost her ability to speak, every once in a while she’d look at me and ask me why? Why is this happening to me? The best I could come up with is “bad luck”. 

How do I keep living in this town and go to all our favorite places without her? I finally seriously considering having kids; she’ll never get to know them. I’ll never get to see her as a grandmother, which is one of the big things she really wanted.

I'm drinking terrified of what's going to happen and I'm just worried sick.

My sister is 27, got married 6 months ago to the love of her life, and was trying to have a baby. 

Early January she found out she had a 3 cm tumor on her frontal lobe. She got it removed about a week after that and from what the doctor said everything is visibly gone along with everything that they could see on a MRI. 


A few days ago she got the results on the tumor a few days ago and it turns out it was a stage three astrocytoma. She's doing 6 weeks of chemo and up to 6 months of radiation. 

In the matter of a month we've all been on an emotional rollercoaster and somehow she's being so strong through it all. She's even still going to the fertility clinic and is trying to freeze some embryos. 

I'm in school, a 5 hour drive away, trying to stay in touch while she's still processing all this and trying to figure it all out by herself. I'm just trying to find out how to cope and the internet is a scary place that isn't helping my concerns when I Google all this information. 

I shouldn't be falling apart. I can hardly find the motivation to go to class I'm worried so much. I'm just worried all the time and I can't get it all out of my head. I'm stuck in the cycle of worrying about my sister, feeling terrible because she's just getting her life started and this is just a huge middle finger in their lives, and then emerging how can my sister be this strong when her life is ripping at the seams.

So my brother(12)  has been talking about a weird bump in his armpit. At first my parents and I throughly that maybe it was an ingrown hair that he was talking about. He’s a young boy and he’s about to go through puberty so we thought it was normal at first. However, the next day or so he had mentioned that it was “growing” so my dad checked it out and found out that it wasn’t an ingrown hair. It was much larger. 

The day after thanksgiving my parents took him to the hospital to get it checked out. The doctors looked at it and said that they were concerned. They found out that it was three swollen lymph nodes that were causing the bump. So they ran a few tests to see if maybe it was an infection that none of us had known about. The results came back and there was no sign of infection nor trauma. 

They said that they wanted to schedule an appointment with his doctor to run more tests. It’s currently Monday and in the two days since the hospital trip the bump has grown tremendously. It’s now reaching his back and we are very concerned. He said that it is beginning to hurt more. Each day it seems as if it’s been rapidly getting worse. 

My father and I don’t want to say anything because we do not want to scare my mother and little brothers. However, we are concerned about him having lymphoma. We have quite a bit of family history dealing with cancer so this doesn’t really paint a calming picture for us.

I’m 16 so to be honest I really have no idea what to do. It’s not certain that he has lymphoma but it’s a real possibility and don’t even know how to process that. I love that kid more than anything in this world and I’m scared for him. I’m scared of what he’s going through and the possibility of what he could possibly have to go though. I don’t know, I feel like I’m over reacting. I’m just scared and really upset about it. I truthfully want to cry because I don’t want anything to happen to the kid. I’ve always been very protective of my little brother but this isn’t something I can protect him from. I can’t take the hit for him this time and I hate it. We have always been very close. My family and I are trying our very best to stay positive and hope for a good outcome right now. 

I have a lot going on as of now, especially with school. Exams are 16 days away and I have a lot of school work to stay on top of. I just feel very overwhelmed and all I can think about is if my little brother will be okay. How can I make his day better today and how can I try to make things better. I don’t really know, my heart just kinda feels heavy if that makes sense. I never thought that my family would every face something like this.

We are still waiting for his next appointment so they can tell us what’s next and what’s going on.

I am getting married soon and I’m not super sure if my dad will be able to come to my wedding due to when he finishes treatments. 

I have gone through so many different emotions. When we first found out I think I was in denial on how hard his treatments are going to be. I was naive to believe he was just going to be the same dad he’s always been after all this. I had this thought that when treatment is done then he’s better, and that’s just simply not the case. 

We went to one doctor who gave us doom and gloom about everything that dad will lose or go through. The first doc said that teeth would all be pulled, feeding tube, loss of voice, loss of all salivary glands, loss of hearing, hair loss, weigh loss. And just loss all over because dad just won’t ever be the same again. And he is a rockstar. 70-80% chance of beating this thing. This doctor said if I want my dad to be at my wedding to get married now. 

The doctor we just met with about proton radiation therapy gave us hope. He said it’s a 10% chance he’ll need a feeding tube, 1% chance of needing to have teeth pulled, will lose just one salivary glands rather than all, 1% chance of losing hearing, no hair loss, no cognitive issues. This doctor worked at MDAnderson for 15 years. This doctor said dad will have hard treatments no doubt but will be able to make it to my wedding. Gave dad a 93-95% chance of beating this thing with less radiation and side effects than the first doctor. We are going to use this doctor for dad’s treatments.

My dad refuses to let us get married before our wedding date because he says he will make it no matter what. This whole thing just feels sucky. I feel jealous of my friend getting married this weekend who will have her dad walk her down the aisle. I feel jealous of my fiancé who will have both his parents at our wedding. I feel mad that this is even happening to a man who has had perfect health and never smoked a day in his life. I don’t know how to watch my superhero be sick and in pain. My dad is the strongest man I know and I know he’s going to beat this and that’s all that matters. I just can’t help but grieve the moment we both have been waiting and praying for. I can’t help but feel sad that I may not have my dad walk me down the aisle and get to dance with at the wedding.

My mother went in for surgery three weeks ago to have a mass roughly the size of a football removed from her abdomen.

I know how it sounds, but she's actually a very petite woman and her 'beer belly' was quite noticable. She and everyone around her including me just chalked it up to weight gain later in life. I guess, hindsight being what it is, we didn't want to think something could be wrong.

Turns out it was in fact ovarian cancer. She healed well from surgery with just the complication of a stomach bug they said was common with this type of surgery. In two days she's going in to have a port installed in her chest for chemo. There are three spots of this cancer left in her that couldn't be removed for some reason.

Just throwing this out there but I am probably the least informed person in this situation. I'm getting all this knowledge second-hand from either my mother or my father. And things keep on changing about what I'm told. At first it was just one spot they couldn't get out, so it may be much worse than they're letting me know.

This kills me on so many levels. I am an adult. When things go south for the both of them I am the adult that will be caring for them. Still I'm being treated like a child. I feel like things are being kept from me to shield me from it for some reason I can't comprehend.

I also feel restricted in how much I can badger either of them about it. They are deniers. If you don't talk about it, it goes away types. Also they are going through this too, I don't want to be an ass.

Thanks for this sub partly to let me vent and help me process this tragedy, also I'd like to ask some questions.

If anyone has knowledge on this type of cancer, is it very treatable? My parents boom with a resounding yes but I find them not the best sources. Also how will this chemo effect her? What can I do to help, if anything?

I would Google these things but, being weak as I am, I can't see through the tears and it makes it so final in a cold detached way. Not like communication with actual human.

I'm sorry, I've rambled. I've never been through this before and I don't know what I'm doing basically.

She lost a lot of weight due to not being able to eat anything and we thought we were going to lose her this time around. I was basically the only one who could and was willing to take care of her throughout everything so that my bf and his mother could work, I took her to treatment, doctor appointments, hospitals, and ERs where we would wait all day for them to get a room for her so they could monitor her, plus taking care of her at home. It got really stressful being the only one doing it all, but I wouldn’t go back to change anything. The cancer is gone along with the breast, they said they won’t take the other one unless there is cancer. They started her on after chemo treatment that she’s been doing since November or December, recently she went in for a echo on her heart and they discovered that the after chemo treatment is messing with her heart, it’s beating faster than normal, and that she needs to stop treatment. She fought so hard to beat cancer, she was doing great, and now she can’t do much of anything because of her heart.

Today I got a message from my uncle, they found two large cancer spots on his lungs, with his COPD and bronchitis he has to stay on oxygen 24 hours a day, chemo is not an option as it’s too harsh and would most likely kill him. They’re trying to find an alternative way to treat him, since he lives in Texas medical marijuana is not an option at the moment, though they are trying to get the bill passed but it’s not looking good for those that need it. I agree with my uncle when he says that he should have stayed in California, right now with everything he would able to get alternative treatment and have a roof over his head, plus he would be only 5 hours from me in case anything happens. He moved to Texas to be closer to a good friend’s family, I thought he was going to live with them, instead he’s living out of his car. We also have family close to him at the moment in Texas and I don’t know why they won’t open their homes to him, one being one of his sisters, one of my aunts.

We’re scheduled to see the oncologist on Friday but just today he said he is done and just wished to die. He doesn’t want to see the doctors. This upset me on so many levels. Is it wrong of me to try to convince him? How can he decide to quit when the fight hasn’t even started? I know he’s scared and anxious, but what can I say to convince him to already hear the doctors out about what can be done? 

It’s such bad timing with his state of mind to try and fight cancer. He hasn’t been exercising for quite sometime and his muscles have slowly atrophied. He struggles to walk. 

I’m not sure his body or mind will let him do chemo. Is radiation just as tough? Targeted therapy? Immunotherapy?

Now he is always depressed, has given up, and doesnt want to live anymore and it hurts me to see him like this. I pray for him everyday and also cry as well. As much aa it kills me i want him to not be in any more pain. I want him to be at peace and want him happy. I dont like seeing him on oxygen and alwsys laying i  bed because it kills me. I wish there was more that i could do then juat tellimg him i love him and trying to be strong when i cant be. Please pray for my grandpa and for the rest of my family 👃🏻👃🏻👃🏻👃🏻👃🏻👃🏻",2019-06-01 10:47:29
997,I am trying to find a way to feel in peace,3,bllw9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/bllw9s/i_am_trying_to_find_a_way_to_feel_in_peace/,1,1557229175.0,"I [16f] recently got news that a close friend of my family passed away due to cancer about a week ago. I feel really depressed. 

I family friend way very close and I just want to vent out my frustrations and disbelief of the reality. The friend was a grown lady with a husband and now adult teen. She helped me when I had trouble with elementary. 

She was a wonderful person to help me study and get great grades and I thank her to this day. In Middle school I grew distant, but my sibling would replace me for study practice. 

Over the years she grew more weary and less frequent until I heard that she had cancer. I don’t remember which type or where it is, but I was sad that I wouldn’t be able to talk to her anymore. 

I decided that I would grow out my hair and cut it for her. She had always complemented my hair and said that she would love to have hair like that. 

That was about 2-3 Years ago that I was told she had cancer. She responded to our text, but few days ago when we texted her. She was gone. I miss her so much. I’ll still treasure her and the things she gifted me and my family. 

I need to tell how I’m feeling. I will continue to grow my hair until I’m a senior and donating all of it to a cancer foundation. I have about 2-3 feet of hair but I want this to be the best perfect hair to my dearest teacher and tutor. I love you Ms.Ruthy please I hope you reached peace after all the stress of cancer. 

Please I just need some kind words. I just have to do so much right now. And thank you for investing time to read this. This is my first post.",2019-05-07 11:39:35
998,How uncommon is it for a 26 year old male with diabetes since he was 13 to get colon cancer ?,3,bl79rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/bl79rb/how_uncommon_is_it_for_a_26_year_old_male_with/,9,1557144128.0,"This is my brother and for the life of me I am dumbfounded with his illnesses... Seeing that the rest of the family have pretty much all been pratty healthy

As a baby he also had way to many ear infections and had an operation for that .
When he was a teenager he also shattered his knee and still has pain .",2019-05-06 12:02:08
999,My dad,3,bkoaw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/bkoaw1/my_dad/,13,1557024159.0,"My dad has been ill for the past 6 months. After many tests, different diagnoses, prescriptions,  he was not getting better.  Recently a ct scan has revealed tumors in his brain, throat, lungs, liver, and intestines. We knew he was pretty ill but did not realize how bad it actually was, and now within the past few days we went from thinking he would get better eventually, to having no hope. Doctors are saying that treatment will only be to make him comfortable. He may not even have a MONTH left. I don't know what to do. My family is a mess. My dad is a mess. It feels unreal.

My dad is not even 60 yet and he has never smoked, doesn't really drink, never touched drugs.  We have so many questions still , and doctors are still doing tests to figure out the source of it. I'm so mad that his cancer was discovered so late and that there's nothing left to do. It feels so unfair.

 Right now he's trying to sort out all his finances and will etc. I cant imagine how that must feel for him. My mom is doing an amazing job keeping it together for everyone but I can see how hard it is for her. She is losing her husband. And it's killing her to see us kids hurting so badly.

I feel extremely useless right now, can't find the words to say to anyone, have no idea how to help my mom. My dad and I are the type of people that find it hard to talk about feelings. It's incredibly difficult seeing him and talking about it.  

 Ive never lost someone close to me. This is the worst feeling I've ever felt.",2019-05-05 02:42:39
