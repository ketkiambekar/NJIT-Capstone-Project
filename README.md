# NJIT-Capstone-Project
This is my Capstone Project @ NJIT

This project was done under the not-for-profit wing of [Nest Global Solutions](https://nestsolutions.com/) for their app "Need to Speak". 
The app caters to individuals experiencing cancer and offers a forum functionality among other features. 

This project creates a Topic Classification Module for identifying topics being talked in a post message in the app.

The project consists of 2 parts:
## 1) Topic Modelling :
Uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Algorithm (clustering) to detect broad topics in the in the text corpus. 

## 2) Topic Classification using Machine Learning
Uses Machine Learning to implement topic classification on the topics detected in part 1. 

### Instructions to run.
1) Clone the repository
2) Run the python file /API/tc_api.py 
3) Supply text message in the UI. 

For any questions regarding the project, feel free to reach out to me (Contact info on my [Github Profile](https://github.com/ketkiambekar) )
